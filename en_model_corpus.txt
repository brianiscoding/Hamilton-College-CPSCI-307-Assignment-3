The neighbor's dog was barking all night.
I explained the procedures to him.
She went to the museum by cab.
He easily licked his opponent.
It's stupid.
These are beautiful horses.
He suddenly stopped.
Here's your desk.
I am very hungry.
We dined at our uncle's.
She's much heavier than him.
What do you spend a majority of your time doing?
Mom is making a cake.
Hand me a tissue.
Raise your left hand.
I used to listen to English programs.
I can't start up my computer. What am I supposed to do?
Tom says he'll only speak to Mary.
Are you happy?
It's not quite as simple as that.
The tetanus shot hurt more than the dog bite.
Would you like something smaller?
You must tell me.
Tom was fairly nervous.
Why are we running?
He squashed my hat flat.
I thought Tom was mistaken.
We can't be killed.
So, why are you here?
I'd like to order the same.
What did you take a picture of?
I hope to one day speak German as well as you speak English.
Hang on a second.
She stood by him.
You're very forward.
Do you really want to work with us?
We meet here once a month.
I want to know everything you know.
You are a genius.
He doesn't like to lose.
I would like a room.
Oh please!
We are the best.
She cried and cried, but nobody came to comfort her.
Tom doesn't have to worry about me.
The old bridge is in danger of collapse.
It has happened before.
There's a park near my house.
I worked this morning.
I locked myself in my room.
You don't seem too sure.
The workers are complaining about the working conditions.
Why should I give you that?
I'm a very, very happy man.
You need stitches.
You really are in trouble, aren't you?
Did Tom skip class again today?
Life is crazy.
Are you feeling under the weather?
Do you know who he was?
Tom appeared to be in his early thirties.
I haven't had one complaint about Tom.
Tom didn't say what you said he said.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
He threw a stone at the big dog.
How have you been getting along lately?
He felt ill at ease.
I don't have the time for this.
Don't stay up all night.
Nobody visits my country.
It must be hard to do that.
You want to remain anonymous.
They're going to the war.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
Tom put on his coat and left.
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry?
Will you come back tomorrow?
My grandfather sometimes talks to himself when he's alone.
I share a house with two of my friends.
I know you're richer than me.
I have problems with my wife, too.
I paid for these tickets.
We have a lot of work to do before we can go home.
I'll make you a new suit.
She told us that we must call a doctor immediately.
Come and warm yourself by the fire.
It is true that I was head over heels in love with her.
We worry about your future.
Don't talk to my sister like that.
It's right up your alley.
All the people who go to church believe in God.
He knows how to swim.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
A little heavier rain might cause a flood.
The construction crews worked around the clock.
It's already late.
I made that one.
Have a nice flight.
Are you a natural blonde?
Seen from the plane, the island looks very beautiful.
I appreciate you stopping by.
Don't dwell too much upon the subject.
I was glad to hear of your success.
Just try it out.
I can't believe how stupid I was.
You aren't as short as I am.
Why didn't you call for help?
This is exactly what I want.
Tom's family isn't very big.
I think it's dangerous to climb a mountain on a day when it's stormy.
Taking off is easier than landing.
That's very kind.
I finally understand what you're saying.
Where did you get that orange scarf?
Why would you want that?
He asked that we be silent.
This is an extremely serious matter.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.
I feel a lot better.
Do you like waffles?
Do you know Noah's ark?
Each country has its own customs.
I hope to return soon.
I know Tom will agree.
Mary looks like her mother, but she has a different personality.
I'd like stay longer, but I have to leave.
We need your support.
Tom comes here every three days.
Tom wanted to see Mary's room.
You're wrong again.
Do you trust anyone?
I'll take my chances with you.
This place is creepy.
You can't live without water.
I want to get rid of it.
You look just like your older brother.
I'd love to go on an adventure with you.
She knew the story already.
They let me go.
He has a tight schedule.
How did you manage to do that?
Tom began fixing dinner.
I admire your perseverance and determination.
I didn't mean it.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What do you want it for?
I'll give you a lift home.
I am interested in music.
It was a heartbreaking story.
Tom and Mary were both frowning.
They're good friends of ours.
We don't trust Tom.
I liked working with you.
Is that enough for you, Tom?
Give me some water, please.
Tom can do better.
Tom paid Mary cash.
Say it clearly.
I'll never forgive you.
I really think you should come.
Do you like sports?
He's your friend.
Who is your teacher?
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
I think we all know what's happening.
I'm impressed with your French.
I borrowed this book from Tom.
He left the box unprotected.
I like summer the best.
Would you like to be rich?
He has not come yet. He may have missed the train.
Don't touch that button!
She is always dressed in black.
Please be careful.
Will you have another cup of coffee? "No, thank you."
We have to keep working on that.
We're tired.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
It's easy if you try.
Would you have time to fix this flat tire now?
You're the only one I trust.
What do you intend to do?
Tom won't tell us what he knows.
This is a dangerous mission.
I love secrets.
We were very excited.
He is probably dead.
The officer inspired his men to be brave.
Coffee, please, with cream and sugar.
Adjust the brakes.
From now on, let's only speak French.
I smell blood.
How was your trip?
I owe him nothing.
There's volcanic ash in the atmosphere.
I got a bad grade.
They saw us yesterday.
The radio is too loud. Turn the volume down.
Please do not kill me.
I'd like you to tell me what happened.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
Both Tom and Mary called me.
He cannot write his own name.
One in ten people have myopia.
A housewife should be economical.
Why can't we just go home?
We're both single.
All your questions will be answered.
You may choose one of them.
I want you to be my friend again.
This mountain has an altitude of 3,000 meters.
He's innocent.
I know Tom talks about Mary a lot.
Comb your hair before you go out.
Tom has two siblings.
They all stopped.
I hear that Tom really speaks French well.
We got a standing ovation.
We won't do what Tom said he wants us to do.
I told you I didn't want any coffee.
I don't know the exact place I was born.
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
This is our main objective.
Tom passed away last year.
They grew closer.
There are a lot of books in his room.
This is a pretty amazing place.
I had a feeling you would be late.
Hand me the hammer.
He's addicted.
She was the last to cross the finishing line.
I want to go home now.
This place isn't safe anymore.
Don't look at us.
You're very nice.
No one agreed with him.
I meet him at the club from time to time.
I admire their ingenuity.
Where do you all live?
No, I didn't go.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
Put on the hat.
We know all about you.
Have you ever been in love?
I've never heard English spoken so quickly.
The dog followed me.
Please say it in English.
I love my family.
We should get married.
I'll be in the library.
She attacked him with a pair of scissors.
The sea is to fish what the sky is to birds.
I'd like you to have this.
My home is close to the station.
The cat was basking in the sun.
This house needs painting.
They're in the science lab.
I really don't understand why you think that's a good idea.
He had to part with his house.
She never managed to pay the bill on time.
Are you still in love with your wife?
I always try to be punctual.
Are all of them your friends?
You won't be needing that again.
You're very sharp.
Do you think they're coming after us?
Listen to what the teacher says.
Who owns this ship?
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
I'm claustrophobic.
I'd recommend not doing that.
Have a taste.
She is trying to prove the existence of ghosts.
I have class in an hour.
I read that report before lunch.
How did you obtain this painting?
That's one of them.
Tom took a shower.
He was banished to an island for high treason.
Could you please briefly introduce yourself?
The zoo was closed on Christmas day.
They're all on vacation.
I was in the room.
Nothing in the world is stronger than the will to survive.
I won't be able to sleep.
I'll show my album to you.
That's my favorite chair.
We had a very good time indeed.
Tom should at least wear a tie.
I'm going to need some more time.
Tell me where Tom took Mary.
It's time for school.
Do you have a valid passport?
The summer vacation is over.
Do you feel all right?
Where is the toilet?
Does he have many books?
He burst into tears.
At first, I mistook you for your brother.
Are you seriously thinking about buying that old car?
Tom enjoys watching sports on TV.
I'm going abroad next summer.
It can't be a coincidence.
You're much prettier than I remember.
This is what I've always wanted to do.
I was planning on telling you.
I'm going to work during the spring vacation.
You're not old enough to drive.
Is the room big enough for you?
I can do it.
Our bike tour of the French Alps lasted two weeks.
Job security is a priority over wages.
I promise I'll bring it right back.
Will you join our club?
That's a real load off my mind.
Is there a link between smoking and lung cancer?
Fix this.
How many of you are going?
There aren't any.
What fruit do you like best?
Wipe your feet before coming in.
He's shy, and never speaks unless spoken to. You have to talk to him.
I'll be out of town next week.
I listen to the radio every night.
Let's not think about it anymore.
I don't think I've slept enough.
He's just like his grandfather.
He's crazy about her.
You all right?
Tom told Mary to go back home.
I don't know where my keys are.
You can't have it both ways.
Tom isn't sneaky.
Do I have to be hospitalized?
How did I not know that?
You really are hopeless.
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
If you eat at this time of night, you'll get fat.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
I wish you were here with me now.
We should do that together.
Are you making fun of me?
I have to find Tom.
It was only much later that I came to understand the importance of child education.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
We agreed to the plan.
You'll have to learn to cook.
Light travels faster than sound.
I know they'll all want to help you.
It's not serious.
The news of her sudden death came like a bolt from the blue.
She hid the secret from her husband all her life.
If you need any help, ask me.
I've got a cold.
Can't we keep this between us?
Tom is insanely jealous.
So, are you going to tell me who you are?
Stop acting like such a weirdo.
He lives far away from my house.
Are you the group leader?
I don't envy you.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
Father wants to make me a doctor.
I recovered.
You can smoke in this room.
They forgot to lock the door.
I think it's time for me to get a dog.
I feel like crying.
Don't be ridiculous.
It was fun playing in the park.
You like Boston, don't you?
I'm now learning French.
Do you have a nail file?
I enjoyed talking with her.
Tom and Mary attempted to murder John.
We're not going to give Tom the money he asked for.
Do I have your permission to do so?
The meeting was just about over.
These shoes are too small for me to put on.
He got sick during the trip.
It's not physically possible.
I'll go get the pizza.
You should've stayed in Boston.
I said that I didn't understand French.
Let me give you some advice.
Do you think it's possible?
Tom accepted our invitation.
Did anybody see you?
She advised him where he should stay.
I think you went too far.
I had a late breakfast.
I was bitten by a lot of insects in the forest.
I think we're going to need it all.
I should tell you something.
I'm pleased with their performance.
He worked very hard, but could make little progress.
I suggest we eat just a little now, and then go out later.
You had no right to do that.
He didn't protest.
The ice cracked under the weight.
I was wrong.
Forget about that right now.
Are you the science teacher?
How did you become involved in this project?
Quit behaving like a kid.
I can't find the word to express what I feel.
The baby weighed seven pounds at birth.
I have time.
Which is your suitcase?
We talked about this yesterday.
It may be unwise of you to advertise your presence.
Spiders have eight legs.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom tells you.
It is difficult for him to solve the problem.
We like to talk.
Are you blowing me off?
It was his first trip as a captain.
There is no antidote.
My gamble paid off.
He can't even read, let alone write.
Tom brought Mary here.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
I've already had lunch.
I'm not as smart as you.
How was your meeting?
I was wrongfully punished.
You're not good at this.
That mountain is covered with snow.
The Shinano is longer than any other river in Japan.
The dog always barks at me.
I'm not doing this anymore.
Your cake is very delicious.
She interrupted him while he was speaking to my father.
Don't smoke in bed.
I've seen this before.
Men and women need each other.
Tom is going to visit Mary tomorrow.
My aunt died an old spinster.
You must take his age into account.
It's not as easy to do that as people think.
She looked more beautiful than ever.
They don't have to know.
I don't believe it.
I didn't run away from home.
Tom came here to help me.
How many ways are there to do that?
Tom isn't much of a dancer.
She is dressed in her best.
Actually, I don't like the way your hair is done.
I've no friend to talk to about my problems.
She went to the hospital yesterday.
Spanish is her native language.
I don't have the authority to give you permission.
Are you enjoying your weekend?
It's a wonderful work of art.
I think I'm done.
I'm worried about him.
We were playing by the rules.
Didn't you used to be a teacher?
I've really missed you.
Life is very short.
That wasn't my intention.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
You should quit smoking.
I couldn't tell you why.
Why limit yourself to just one?
I paid him on the spot for his work.
This firm manufactures cars at the rate of two hundred per day.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
My family isn't such a big family.
What's your theory on what happened?
I'm going to join the school orchestra.
We can't tell anybody.
Don't even joke about that.
I read the entire book.
How can I get to the station?
You gotta get more organized.
Don't you feel anything?
What difference does it make if people are looking at us?
What are you cooking?
I was the only one not invited to the party.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
He gave a short talk.
He's very fond of walking.
It wasn't mine.
You may kiss the bride.
Who's my teacher?
Is eating a clove of garlic every day beneficial to your health?
Do not tell me what to do.
My curtains were closed, so I didn't see what was happening outside.
I can't believe we haven't run into each other before.
I have other plans for you.
She cried as she read the letter.
I did everything I could to stop Tom.
What are you working on?
It is warm there all the year round.
What do you do for a living?
How do you know it's true?
We should do everything ourselves.
You can't park your car here.
Why are people scared of you?
Tell me what you eat, I'll tell you what you are.
Keep me in the loop.
Someone's taken my umbrella.
I went there for the express purpose of earning money.
He lit the candles.
We're heading for disaster.
When did you finish the work?
You're careless.
There are many tall buildings in that town.
Let's go to the beach.
I told Tom that what he was doing was illegal.
Tom wore goggles.
I would take it as a sign.
Can you pick me up at the station?
We have not been notified about their change of address.
Why aren't you studying French?
I have to talk to you alone.
I lay in bed thinking about everything that had happened that day.
She fooled him.
Just tell me what you want.
Have some ham.
They could've killed you.
We can't allow Tom to do that.
What do you plan on doing with the money?
I'd like to dance.
Who else do you want on your team?
I was not pleased.
Does this bus go to the beach?
I saw Tom going into the bank.
Don't call the cops, man.
I have high blood pressure.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
She gave an oral report to her boss.
I think a movie is more entertaining than any book.
The meeting was cancelled.
The water began to boil.
Poverty does more to bring out the worst in people and conceal the best than anything else in the world.
You've been suspended.
It is necessary for you to go.
What if the unthinkable should happen?
You lied to me.
He is giving me a hard time.
Tom and Mary make a very nice couple.
It means nothing to me.
I bought the book yesterday.
I bought a farm not too far from Boston.
She makes him do his homework before dinner.
His patience is worn out.
What I need is a little more time.
Did you get any sleep at all last night?
Do I know you?
I hate winter.
I'd prefer not to take that risk.
Are you allergic to peanuts?
Thanks for pointing this out.
Take the wheel.
Can you stay and watch the children?
This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
That's what I want most right now.
That's where the problem is.
I know when to say when.
Tom never helps me.
It doesn't matter, right?
It's my duty to protect you from danger.
Don't stop until I tell you.
What difference would it make if people did that?
I hope the economy picks up soon.
You should have known better than to go out in the rain without an umbrella.
They set the time and place of the wedding.
I have nothing to do with the crime.
We can't go.
He was sentenced to prison.
No student went to the party.
Tom's grandfather was illiterate.
I sometimes hear my father singing in the bath.
Don't let this chance slip by.
Hunting season is over.
I lost my watch, so I have to buy a new one.
We surrender.
No one is asking you to eat that.
I want to stay in a hotel near the airport.
I wish my girlfriend would spend more time with me.
Tom is a financial analyst.
She became a great artist.
I'll be back soon.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
It's customary for waiters and waitresses to introduce themselves using only their first names.
I didn't take the wrong umbrella.
His anger is understandable.
Shall we talk about it over a cup of coffee?
This is odd.
The door of the office is yellow.
The children got lost in the woods.
Tom knew what Mary wanted to eat.
This material stretches easily.
I'll never leave.
I'll provide you with all the necessary information.
How is your new class?
This is a safe place.
Have you ever broken a bone?
I don't eat the apple core.
She devoted herself to him.
How can you be sure of that?
They took a sample of my blood at the hospital.
I was able to do it.
She called up her mother on the phone.
We're going to the movies.
It's a good start, don't you think?
I couldn't make myself understood well in English.
Are you happy with the service?
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston.
I like my life right now.
Have you ever been a witness in a court case?
We must sit down.
Do you have a problem with me?
Since I had a cold, I was absent from school.
How many of these things have you made?
We knew that Tom would win.
Recently I moved to another apartment.
Let's try to understand one another.
I am a new student.
I feel the same way as you do.
I enjoy chess.
I hope we're not making a huge mistake.
Hurry up, or you will miss the train.
I don't get it.
I just got a new phone.
That should have never happened.
You should have your eyes examined.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
Do you have any money with you?
I stopped laughing.
We need action, not words.
As I was reading, I became more interested.
This probably means war.
They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
Tom went home with Mary.
I think you should sit down.
You're not alone.
His helplessness appeals to her motherly sympathy.
Do you really think Tom will help us?
It appears that he is a musician.
Who's on the team?
Look up the words in your dictionary.
It must've been extremely painful.
Your dress is unsuitable for the occasion.
I can't get that out of my mind.
Are you ready to go?
She came to see us yesterday.
How long do we have?
Did he touch you?
He always goes to work at 8:00 a.m.
It's been weeks since she's written.
You're too hard on yourself.
My sister is suffering from a bad cold.
Does he live here?
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
We have no choice but to carry on.
I didn't want you to miss your bus.
I'm afraid I don't agree with you.
I'll call you in the morning.
You're pathetic.
We don't really know Tom.
No one is asking you to eat that.
One of the windows was broken.
Do you think that's a coincidence?
It is extremely hot and humid in Bali in December.
That would be fine.
You don't have to apologize.
We should observe the speed limit.
It's all right, I won't tell anybody.
Who am I talking with?
I tore the picture out of the album.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
Tom explained why he was there.
Didn't you hear the bell?
They have plenty of money.
That would be a waste of her talent.
I promise to return this videotape within a week.
My little sister asked me to teach her how to ski.
We're working as fast as we can.
No one is asking you.
I nailed it.
Tell me you're not serious!
Please don't forget to write the letter.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
She didn't telephone after all.
It's very different.
The child came aboard the plane in a good mood.
Who did you visit yesterday afternoon?
He's about the same age as you are.
There is an urgent need for social change.
You don't look so busy.
Could you kill someone?
I closed my umbrella.
It'll be difficult to do that.
You're very clever.
I bet you're busy.
I've experienced the same thing.
What's this?
This book sells well in Japan.
They made the right choice.
It never snows here.
There was no one about.
He has two daughters, one is a pianist and the other is a violist.
Can you please close the window?
Tom didn't want to go any further.
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
How did we not see it?
You owe me an apology for that.
I have enough money to buy it.
Fewer young people know how to write in longhand.
He has one foot in the grave.
That's kind of you to say.
They left without me.
I saw the man knocked down by a car.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
It's already too late.
Hand me a towel.
I don't have time right now.
She left her ticket at home.
My tastes differ greatly from yours.
He seems kind.
Who broke the news of her death to you?
Will you go, too?
I know I should've done that.
I am off duty tomorrow.
Tom couldn't tell Mary what he'd seen.
I never thought this rubber band would come in handy when I put it in my pocket this morning.
Tom showed her the letter from Santa Claus.
Why did I do that?
You're very good.
If I had wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it.
Give up smoking if you want to live long.
I'm not sure what's wrong with the car.
Nobody believed Tom.
This fish smells bad.
I feel a lot better now.
He's very sloppy in his dress.
Do you smoke?
What was it that brought you to me?
I was hoping you could help.
Tom's passions are guitar and baseball.
It's pretty bad.
Fill the bottle with water.
Give me a hand.
I thought you'd left.
Call me.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
I was really very busy.
I can't deal with you anymore.
Don't confuse the two.
It won't be long before he is up and about.
This pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
They said yes.
They gave us their word.
This poor cat almost died of hunger.
Can't we go with Tom?
No one was really surprised.
Do you know anyone who was on that ship that sunk?
She is always neatly dressed.
I want to live in Italy.
I never wanted to harm you.
Start reading where you left off.
They found out.
Our electric heater does not work well.
My father won't allow me to do that.
It was mandatory.
I'm short of cash at the moment.
The fire is spreading.
I should've changed the oil.
You're making a big mistake.
Do you remember what you were watching?
We'll never get through this.
When I'm hot, a glass of cool water really refreshes me.
The piano is expensive.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
It's up to you to decide what to do.
I don't compromise.
What he said is a good idea.
Don't pay any attention to what people say.
How can you not know?
Do you like mine?
Today, I'm not going to school.
You can't believe that.
I'd like some information about your new computers.
Do you mind if I help myself?
I wanted to go.
Please open the bottle.
I'm glad to see you here.
I'm not tall.
He succeeded in business at the cost of his health.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
He is independent of his parents.
Tom comes from Australia.
There seems to be something peculiar about the boy.
Do you have a bag?
Where shall I hang this calendar?
Why are we studying French?
I've only seen him once.
No wonder they turned down her offer.
She feeds her dog the same thing that she eats.
You won't be interested.
The mouse ran underneath the bed.
You do seem a little on edge.
Her cheeks were red.
So what else is new?
Tom and Mary are asleep.
I'm concerned for my kids.
Are you vegetarian?
Be careful what you wish for.
We talked for a while.
You can have someone do it for you.
She didn't try to translate the letter.
You did well, Tom.
Can we come in?
He is a good singer.
I've seen Tom on TV many times.
It is easy to add numbers using a calculator.
I was knocked unconscious.
Are you over your cold yet?
I like this game.
Most of the plain, simple, everyday things he desires can be secured by people of average means.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Do it any way you can.
You should sit down.
I was very rich until I met her.
I want you to treat me a little nicer from now on.
I want to make sure nothing's broken.
Who won today?
You are to blame.
This is the shortest way to the station.
Show me.
I can see the top of the mountain.
Can I drive the tractor?
Are you going to go with me or not?
I should get back to my seat.
The parrot is dead.
You won't be harmed.
My dream has come true.
I had some trouble finding her house yesterday.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know Tom is a light eater.
Stop that now.
Could you get it for me now?
He dislocated his shoulder.
I bet you're right.
Are you jealous?
You're very resourceful.
She is wearing an expensive necklace.
You must be more polite.
What were you doing before this?
We're not mad.
I just wish we could leave this horrible place.
He was conspicuous by his absence.
I didn't buy them.
Hundreds of thousands of people were out of work.
Winter is my favorite season.
I take a walk with my dog in the evening.
I've become accustomed to the heat.
My phone was out of order.
You're the champion, aren't you?
You can't say anything till you know the circumstances.
I don't handle loneliness well.
I am taking tomorrow off.
I own a yacht.
That's all I can do.
Can you teach me French?
I love the food here.
They were surprised by what they saw.
The introduction of the new tax is expected to affect the entire economy.
He asked for a pay raise.
I'm the one who asked for help.
I can't say.
I just don't want any of these.
Japan plays a key role in the world economy.
It's midnight.
Help me.
They had a meeting.
You will always be welcome.
I didn't realize you were here.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
This cloth feels like velvet.
Let's just not talk anymore.
Clean up the kitchen.
I made the woman angry.
He arrived safe and sound.
You'll feel at home.
Is death the only way out?
He inherited the business from his father.
I can't speak French.
Let's try to make our world better.
I have seen that girl before.
The north wind blew all day.
The nightmare is finally over.
Don't you think this suits me?
Why pay when you can get it for free?
What does that word mean?
You're all racists.
Do you want me to rub your shoulders?
I can't put up with that noise.
I feel useless.
I appreciate the thought.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I love this time of year.
He hasn't talked to me since.
Where do you think we came from?
Wait until your father gets home.
Horses sleep standing up.
He has become thin beyond all recognition.
I feel awful.
Please help me.
We took a long walk.
Change trains at the next station.
It seems that he's happy.
We've been trying to reach Tom for three days.
I feel like throwing up.
I'm not that worried.
He has had a long teaching career.
Please tell me how to cook sukiyaki.
I saw you doing that.
Can I count on your loyalty?
The three were arrested.
I'm overweight.
This is the best camera in the store.
Stop me if you can.
The man answers the description.
Tom knows he has no choice.
This is my baby.
Why don't you stay a while?
You are incredibly naive.
It sounds great!
We have no school today.
How old were you when you left Australia?
Are you proud of yourself?
He cannot be saved.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
This novel is difficult to understand.
You're with friends.
How do you propose to do that?
I suppose that's possible.
This beef is tender.
I'll do it, if you insist.
Oil and water don't mix.
I've been looking all over for you.
He has taken all this trouble for nothing.
Would you mind if I borrowed this?
Don't tease me.
How are you?
I don't care about politics.
I just don't remember.
Your socks don't match.
You can choose one of them.
He was sleeping under the tree.
I know it's a lie.
You're a nervous wreck.
I succeeded in reaching the top of the mountain.
We have a decision to make.
I was born and raised right here.
I'm cutting my trip short.
May I sit next to you?
I didn't know you were expecting anyone.
I didn't know Tom smoked.
I know you want to help.
What are they made of?
I have good hearing.
Days are getting longer.
I'd like to have her teeth straightened.
That's all for now, folks.
He held out his hand and I took it.
I know all the details.
I don't take needless risks.
Am I hungry!
As we went around the corner, the lake came into view.
The future will come soon enough.
The rumor's all over town.
I forgot my glasses somewhere.
You dropped something.
I don't need your advice.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
I hate long flights.
We'll start whenever you are ready.
My small bladder has me constantly running to the bathroom.
Why aren't you studying French?
They're crazy.
I've been very busy since I returned from abroad.
Tom laughed nervously.
You can't talk to me that way.
The waiter went to get another glass.
He was petting the dog.
They live in that house among the trees.
The mail can't be delivered.
Tom calls Mary every night.
That's a blue house.
I can do it in half the time.
I'm smarter than you.
I'm really looking forward to next March, when they roll out the new Play Station 2.
Tom disappeared in October.
I needed time to convince her.
What did they hit you with?
It is next to impossible.
Do it yourself.
Why didn't you call for help?
I'm the type who likes to think things over very carefully.
She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
Are you trying to grow a beard?
I was tired.
I feel good after a workout.
You're precise.
All the apples are here.
How do you know what color it is?
Money doesn't grow on trees, you know.
Do you want me to drive you to the airport?
They're both right.
This is a book about England.
Do you believe global warming is the result of human actions?
I'm reading.
I regret going there.
I have an idea.
Being too nervous to reply, he stared at the floor.
He isn't actually the manager.
Tom is going to cross the river.
Some of them are my friends.
You don't need to hurry.
That joke isn't funny.
I didn't know you were awake.
What a shame!
How many days are there in a week?
There's nobody in the kitchen.
I must continue.
Tom went with Mary to Boston.
She failed every time she tried.
I'll take care of it later.
Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
I knew this moment would come.
It's evident that you told a lie.
I suggest you tell me the truth.
Do you think I should do this?
I take it you don't agree.
It'll definitely rain.
Let me explain how this works.
They just want someone to blame.
The train will probably arrive at the station before noon.
Everybody started to leave.
Sugar is bad for your teeth.
I'm not like that anymore.
This is a good system.
Some people like him and other people don't.
Tom is your uncle.
He never speaks of the accident.
Where did you learn that?
I love to teach.
I'm not coming back home.
Classes start at eight in the morning.
He does not smoke.
She went shopping with him last Monday.
I'm not unhappy.
Your room is ready.
Our town was bombed twice this week.
I hate being photographed.
Don't blame me.
Don't be so silly.
Please don't forget to mail this letter.
I thought I'd always be alone.
I know that you're clever.
You look different today.
There's a lot of room left for improvement.
He hid his emotions and pretended to be enthusiastic.
You could sleep in the hammock.
Make a circle and hold hands.
I'm not done.
When can I move in?
We all want answers.
She called him on the phone.
I advise you wear a heavy coat.
Tom was the only one who was hurt.
Tom hid Mary's doll behind the door.
I took the cake out of the oven.
There's a new boy in school.
Where's the proof?
Australia is no different.
He respects his father.
I don't feel like going to the movies. Let's take a walk instead.
I fixed it.
Do you have any questions about what needs to be done?
Tom refused to tell us anything.
I'm looking forward to going to the zoo with you.
My sister is in her twenties.
Tom has just resigned.
Tom now faces criminal charges.
I sure hope he passes the test.
Our music teacher advised me to visit Vienna.
Can this wait till morning?
The snow prevented the train from running.
I'm unlikely to do that again.
Her desires were fully fullfilled.
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
He drank detergent by mistake.
I'm too old for you.
She lives just down the street.
She's made up her mind and refuses to be talked out of it.
You don't have to explain.
I just want to be normal.
We don't have all afternoon.
Where are the car keys?
What am I agreeing to?
Nobody can stop us from doing that.
She earns half as much money as her husband.
We must pay the tax.
Tom is an experienced dental assistant.
He has not yet succeeded.
Mary put on too much perfume.
I grow many kinds of roses.
Man cannot live without air.
I'd love to be able to find more time that I could spend relaxing.
Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.
I thought I heard you.
She said something to him.
I wasn't at home last night.
This train is bound for Boston.
I am very hungry.
What language are you speaking?
If you don't hurry, you won't get there before dark.
Beauty is but skin deep.
Have you given Tom the key?
I get arrested from time to time.
I've been sent to relieve you.
We postponed the event.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
I'm ashamed.
What an attractive woman!
The country is in a bad economic state.
Bring me today's paper, please.
The person reading a book on the bench under the tree is Tom.
What would you like to eat?
She is no less beautiful than her mother.
I have an appointment at 2:30.
If you want to, we'll go.
We're going to go into the other room.
He is the last man I want to see.
I just kind of want to be alone right now.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
I'm not carrying any identification.
In the summer, I wear cotton shirts.
We all want you back.
Neither of us could've done that alone.
Trust me on this.
I'm surprised to see you again.
Think of your family.
I finished it.
You don't have to come.
My parents wouldn't let me date who I wanted to date.
Do you have my book?
Laser printers are generally cheaper to maintain than inkjet printers.
Children play in this park every day.
I'm surprised this machine still works.
I don't feel like eating.
She put the children to bed.
Tom says he won't come to our party.
My life is almost over.
It will be cloudy tomorrow.
Tom can't forgive Mary for what she did.
Have you counted the towels?
Were the windows closed?
Do you trust anyone?
Which program did you watch yesterday?
This won't be easy.
Do you have a larger size?
When did you buy that?
I fell in love with her at first sight.
Tom said he didn't know you.
At the time, our country was confronted with serious economic difficulties.
You're too skinny.
My big brother finished his homework very quickly.
Tom speaks French, and so does Mary.
I almost believe you.
A beautiful salesgirl waited on me in the shop.
Some kids are playing in the park.
Tom began to worry about Mary.
It might be enough.
The room smelled bad.
Tom is the captain of this baseball team.
I know Tom's widow.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
He's a cardiologist.
He bribed that politician with a great deal of money.
I just wanted to write songs.
This isn't my fault, is it?
Would you be willing to help?
I want you to watch this video.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
I really have nothing else to say.
I read at least one book every month.
I can not feel at home in a luxurious hotel.
Tom won't go alone.
I saw you outside.
Why are you so quiet?
Can you explain your answer?
Do you like writing?
The girls are excited.
I never should've let Tom eat so much candy.
I want one!
We often played chess after school.
I think that walruses are cuter than manatees.
Without further ado, let me introduce tonight's guest.
I'd forgotten that you'd forgotten.
She punished her children.
I moved here last October.
Do you know which book sells well now?
Could we ask you a few questions?
They don't like to do that.
I want to see your boss.
I think I can solve this problem by myself.
We should do better.
What can I get you to drink?
I know you want to be rich.
Tom spoke.
That changes nothing.
Are you going to share that?
Please write your contact address here.
Two months have passed since he left for France.
I started doing this work 4 years ago.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
My wife's going to kill me.
I missed you a lot while you were in Boston.
The team was quite nervous before the game.
I think we should quit.
You look a little shaken.
He speaks English fluently.
He's a hopeless case.
I really appreciate your coming.
Why did you come over here?
Where were you when your wife disappeared, Tom?
His words rendered me speechless.
I think many people do that.
There wasn't much traffic this morning.
Only adults may watch that film.
Tom killed Mary because he found out she had started the fire that had killed his family.
Whose is all this money?
Try us again next Monday.
Is anybody in there?
Tom is dating an exchange student from China.
Does anyone want to do anything?
They can't do that.
I'd like a copy of that document as soon as possible.
It really is difficult.
Tom says that he can wait.
He warned me that I would fail.
Let me explain that to you.
We're trying to close the box.
Tom prepared a healthy meal for Mary.
It was because he was sick that he decided to return home.
I made a huge mistake.
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
I am very thankful to you for your advice.
I'd like to go faster.
He is unable to concentrate on his academic work.
I can't remember exactly.
In case the shipment is delayed, we have special delay insurance.
If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while.
It's just a rumor.
Don't be late.
Where could the cat be?
Tom seems lost.
She's starting to annoy me.
The streets are flooded.
She advised him to take better care of himself.
This place is really beautiful.
Tom likes living in Boston.
I don't have anybody who'll listen to me.
I made coffee.
He lost both his parents at an early age.
They all drowned.
The joke's on you.
I'm very interested in the job.
He seems to be asleep.
I didn't know what to say to him.
He showed us a few pictures.
Researchers say that it's easier to lose weight if you eat three square meals a day.
We don't even know if it's true.
Do you have something that you want to say to me?
Where were you today?
I like to play basketball.
I shouldn't have slept in.
Tom didn't even know how to say "thank you" in French.
Take this medicine. You will feel better soon.
What's all the ruckus?
Tom was popular.
Can I come backstage?
He was naive.
Try to be generous and forgive.
I'll give you a shot.
Tell him where he should go.
Can you identify this?
Could you please tell me what your cell phone number is?
He always speaks of the government with contempt.
As a rule of thumb, you should plan on one pound of beef for every two guests.
We wish him well in his future endeavors.
I let go of the rope.
I can't just leave you here.
I can't afford to buy a new car.
We've got a job to do.
Our love will last forever.
He is looked up to as their leader.
She is easygoing.
May I assist you?
Refreshments will be served afterwards.
Throw the dice.
They opened the door.
I just can't stop crying.
I don't really want you mad at me.
Many of our customers are in Australia.
May I go?
Let's do it another time.
Have you ever walked through a graveyard at midnight?
What kind of work will you do?
How's your little sister?
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
I know what you were doing.
Didn't anyone question you?
I'm healthy.
You're not alone.
I'm no friend of yours.
We asked him what he was called.
I'm glad I left Boston.
I realized that even though I wanted to eat, I didn't have enough time.
Why don't you quit?
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
I'm getting a bit confused.
It's not just about the money.
The game was postponed until next Sunday.
Tom insisted on going alone.
My boss isn't satisfied with my report.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
It's not safe to swim in that river.
I think it's impossible for us to beat him.
Tom is older than Mary.
Driving through that snowstorm was a nightmare.
We got caught in a rainstorm.
Hasn't the parcel arrived yet?
I have no money with me.
What else is new?
Sit down and take it easy for a while.
You are too young to travel alone.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Those shoes go well with this white skirt.
Fasten the gate.
I had loads of fun.
She was always ready to help people in trouble.
I have a delivery to make.
Are you on your way to the tennis court?
You have to choose your own path.
Tom saw a play in the new theater.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
You don't stand a chance.
What time did you wake up?
After his wife died, he lived for quite a few more years.
I'm having trouble focusing.
I want Tom to go get me something to eat.
She had to use her dictionary many times.
Do you believe in UFOs?
I think I look fat in these jeans.
Why didn't you get one before we left?
I want you to come with us tonight.
Where is the nearest police station?
I'll sue you.
She is no match for me.
Don't tell me what I already know.
Tom helped his mother decorate the Christmas tree.
I don't think we need that.
You'll be all right again in a couple of days.
I think he is angry.
I'm home all the time.
This one is as good as that one.
Goodbye till tomorrow.
What did you open it with?
I'm still in shock.
You should prepare a room for the visitor.
He was distracted by the beautiful girl.
I go to school on foot.
Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?
Dig faster.
How may I help you?
You're so impatient with me.
I really wasn't sure.
I want to do this alone.
I was drugged.
You're the first person I told that to.
You don't even know why I'm here.
I unfortunately drew a wrong conclusion.
Tom sat on the window sill.
That's not my name.
We'd like separate checks.
I know a way.
When did you become a teacher?
I just love beautiful women.
It appears that she might change her mind.
He ran away so he wouldn't be caught.
You have a very pretty name.
Why didn't you go to the police?
That's not exactly how it happened.
I work on the other side of town.
When they are in danger, they run away.
Tom often watches TV while eating dinner.
Go to the barber.
I wish I had been there with you.
Playing cards is fun.
We can do that now.
Did anyone see you come in here?
I no longer wish to be your husband.
Tom is probably not happy right now.
It's one of those moments.
See for yourself.
You must get up a little earlier.
She ignored all my warnings.
The red lines on the map represent railway lines.
I know you've got a secret.
He has almost no money, but he gets by.
We need carrots and tomatoes for the soup.
Osaka is the center of commerce in Japan.
I'm getting up at six o'clock tomorrow morning.
Tom lies.
A baby has no knowledge of good and evil.
To tell the truth, I completely forgot.
Tom seemed satisfied with Mary's answer.
If this airplane were to be hijacked, what in the world would you do?
It's April first.
I know exactly who it is.
He is swimming in the pool.
Take a picture.
She makes it a point to always arrive fashionably late.
This didn't surprise me.
Practice is the best teacher.
I'm not disagreeing.
Do you have anything to eat in your pack?
He can also speak Russian.
This is a touching story.
The bills keep piling up.
I'd leave.
My younger sister got married in her teens.
Just stay there.
I have to borrow some money.
Answer the question.
I've hurt myself.
Do you realize that?
I just had a talk with your teacher.
Leave me alone!
You’d better lie low for a few weeks.
The earthworm wriggled when I touched it.
You're not good at this.
Why didn't you do it?
I took it for granted that she would come.
I haven't yet told Tom about that.
I don't know if it will be fine tomorrow, but if it is fine we'll go on a picnic.
Tom might be able to fix that.
I'll be there in a sec.
I don't know when it was exactly.
I know how important Tom is to you.
Tom died in Autralia in 2013.
We're not impressed.
It's not what we want.
Tom seems calm.
I wish that Tom was here to help us.
According to Tom's doctors, his condition is incurable.
I feel funny.
I shower every night.
I invited my neighbor to breakfast.
I think I have a better idea.
I'm watching a movie right now.
This show is too racy for teenagers.
When will they give a concert?
I tried to talk to Tom, but he ignored me.
My shift begins at noon.
Who do you want to talk to?
I need this more than you.
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I'm assuming this is your father.
Would you like to talk to a lawyer?
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
Did I mess up again?
It has stopped raining.
It was very difficult.
It has to stop.
Do you want anything?
Tom was looking for place to eat that had reasonable prices.
They wanted protection.
Tom's house is only three blocks away from here.
The boy did nothing but cry all day long.
He doesn't listen to me.
It's late, so turn off the TV.
You said you didn't care.
He claims to be a socialist, and yet he has two houses and a Rolls Royce.
Can I see you a second outside?
Everything was better in the past.
My friends celebrated my birthday.
Do you know anyone in Australia?
I'm psychic.
Stock prices fell sharply.
I have to finish this first.
How tall is he?
Can you please stop singing?
Take a wild guess.
I'll see what I can do, but no promises.
I actually had fun tonight.
He's your friend.
I can't agree with you.
When did she leave the classroom?
He cut some branches off the oak tree.
Whose friend are you?
It was too hard.
I'll finish it as quickly as I can.
I have another job now.
There is no need to talk about it.
A catastrophe has been averted.
Don't rely on him.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
How much is that mountain bike?
I'm glad you're my friend.
Go play outside. It's a beautiful day.
I saw somebody.
She worked for a rich man.
This house isn't very big.
Tom finished his meal first.
His book is very interesting.
I went out by bicycle.
Stop staring at me.
Who wants to come with me?
I don't care for wine.
Mary left Tom for another man.
The President is usually accompanied by his wife when he goes abroad.
What do you remember?
She looked at me with tears running down her cheeks.
I know what I'd do.
You don't have any reason to be jealous.
I could not afford to buy a bicycle.
My plan is still better than yours.
He is glad about his son's love of books.
I know Tom is in.
I'm glad we agree on something.
The girl's eyes were filled with tears.
He noticed her embarrassment.
He tried to give up smoking several times, but failed.
Don't tell anyone what we're doing.
I'm not bluffing.
Does Tom want to watch the movie with us?
Tom certainly didn't vote for her.
I'm letting you go.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
I've never even told my husband.
I did my homework.
You're still alive.
Thank you for greeting me.
I am a tourist.
What's its name?
I'm not done.
You aren't invited.
How is your mother?
Close all the windows.
Europeans like to drink wine.
Don't be stupid.
I don't mind at all.
In her free time, she likes to be on the Internet.
We're your friends.
Tom locked himself in the bathroom and refused to come out.
Will you light the fire?
I do not feel sad.
The company will soon go bankrupt.
Life is full of surprises.
Dogs can see in the dark.
I gave Tom that.
Maybe you can help us.
The press has been hounding the president nonstop about reneging on his promise not to raise taxes.
Not everything is black and white.
That problem is not avoidable.
Don't tell your mother what you've seen here.
Do you often listen to audiobooks?
Here's something I want you to give to Tom.
Let me just finish this.
He can read.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't go there alone.
I'd like to live in that house.
I think it's all right now.
How's Tom?
I am looking for my glasses.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
Don't be sorry.
I'm sorry, the flight is full.
I didn't understand any of that.
I moved last month.
Take a few days off.
Which airport do I leave from?
Come over here and join us.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
My mother is preparing dinner.
He left the room without saying a word.
That's exactly what we want.
I really misjudged you.
Climbing that mountain was a piece of cake.
From this point, we'll go on by car.
I just want you back.
You can't imagine doing that, can you?
The red skirt is new.
Can you tell the twins apart?
We're going to see a foreign film tonight.
That young lady is a nurse.
What she said turned out to be false.
You're very generous.
I want to know what you know.
I think Tom didn't understand you.
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
Tom is sitting on the grass.
Is this water drinkable?
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Watch your speed.
I lost everything I had.
I'll do it now.
Nobody likes rats.
I hope you're happy, too.
Just be glad you're OK.
I don't like novels without heroes.
What gave me away?
We're not your enemy.
Can you do some shopping for me?
You were perfect.
I'm glad to see you here.
He turned the doorknob with his left hand.
I support you a hundred percent.
Stop right here.
I hadn't expected anyone to be home.
I pretended to work.
Since he was tired, he went to bed early.
I don't think I can help you.
I fell in the pool.
I didn't suspect anything.
Take a breath.
He's at her side.
Why is love so complicated?
I didn't do what I was told to do.
She owns many valuable works.
How did you enjoy the movie?
Let's hurry up.
How about running?
My father is so old that he is hard of hearing.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
It's there someone you can trust?
Whoever did this was smart.
These new immigrants had no skills.
I tried to do that, but I couldn't.
Tom went back to his seat.
Tom likes Mary's long black hair.
Tom's death has been officially ruled as an accident.
We had to wait until she found a chair and sat down.
I'll pray hard.
Tom tried to sleep.
You don't look your age.
I'd just like to know what I did wrong.
I almost always win.
The juggler wowed the crowd by keeping ten oranges up in the air.
A little work won't kill you.
Nobody can hear you.
I don't know what came over me.
She robbed me blind.
Mary and Alice both married men younger than them.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
It's transparent.
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
Have some ham.
Are you really as old as you say you are?
Mom wants to go there, but Dad wants to watch TV at home.
I'd do anything for those kids.
You're not very good.
I don't want to hear your theories.
I freaked out.
England and France are separated by the English Channel.
Stay a little longer.
I like your article.
I was never in love with Tom.
This reminds me of home.
You know this is illegal, don't you?
Won't somebody please help me?
Tom tried to lift the box.
How old were you when you first did that?
We were so worried.
He got tired of reading.
You're a survivor.
She brought him to our place.
Please translate this into French.
The coup attempt was foiled at the last moment.
See you all tomorrow.
It was probably nothing.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
A home is more than a mere building.
There's a body in the trunk of the car.
I swear I will never do such a thing.
Are you dressed?
I guess I'd better be going.
My wife used to stay home, but she works now.
I did it anyway.
Kyoto is famous for its shrines and temples.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
There are many possible explanations.
I can hardly hear you.
Tom asked me if I had a black tie he could borrow.
They were plainly dressed.
I'd be willing to do anything to get that job.
What did you get hit with?
The house has been empty for years.
Could you lend me some money until this weekend?
No one agreed with me.
Keep me in the loop.
You don't have to hurry.
Would you come with us?
The chicken is undercooked.
Students are impatient for the summer holidays to come.
Even though she was a heavy woman, she danced well.
Are you two busy?
I'll tell you why I don't like Tom.
Please turn on the radio.
I felt cheated.
I got an ink blot on this form.
That mountain is in the clouds.
You'll have to do that on your own.
Let's hit the road.
We were both proud of you.
They were not impressed.
People say that he is the richest man in this town.
How did you vote on that matter?
Did I hear you talking to someone?
What do you do in your free time?
That's your duty.
Do you know where Tom and his friends went?
They know the truth.
I knew you wouldn't listen to me.
You're worried, aren't you?
You're not allowed in there.
The press confirmed the rumors.
Charge it to my room.
We toured all the major cities.
He is popular with his men.
I want to thank you for your time.
What is my room number?
Where is the train station?
He was sick, but he went to school.
We're almost there.
Someone called on her yesterday.
I'll miss you all.
He appeared young.
He was too tired to go any further.
It needs washing.
Can you go faster?
We were ordered to do that.
I had difficulty convincing her of the dangers of smoking.
I have not eaten any seafood since the recent oil spill.
He ran away when he saw me.
We all want you back.
Did I hurt you?
Please don't be sad any more.
He entered my room.
He doesn't even drink beer, not to mention whiskey.
Turn the radio up a little.
I'm not making that up.
Don't open this window.
That sounds very interesting.
I'd be very grateful if you'd help me.
Could we talk in private?
It's making me nervous.
Don't you regret getting that tattoo?
Tom always goes to school by bicycle.
Tom and Mary are playing a video game.
I asked her to marry me and she accepted.
Now's the time to apply.
Do you live in this building?
He burst into laughter.
I saw the man enter the room.
How old is this book?
Turn up the volume.
Stop deluding yourselves.
Love is everything.
She is angry with me.
Tom is really overweight, isn't he?
There is no milk left.
I'll never tell anyone where I've hidden the treasure.
Give me a copy of this book.
I know those women.
I need to renew my ID card.
I just want to know what I'm getting into.
Do you think that dress suits her?
I want a better look at this document.
Mary is extremely attractive.
Don't intrude on her privacy.
I'm beginning to feel a little hungry.
Ask Tom what we should do next.
It's a no-brainer.
I like dark red better.
I quickly ate lunch.
I know Tom should do that.
Don't bother waking me up at 4:00 a.m. I don't plan to go fishing tomorrow.
This telephone is out of order.
Get to the point.
The children were asleep upstairs.
People can turn to the law if they want to correct an injustice.
I can rely on Tom.
I can protect you.
I'm not too worried about Tom.
They're all dead.
She has been dating him for about two years.
I usually go to school by bus.
I have so much to offer.
I'm not fighting.
Speaking English isn't easy.
I don't pretend to understand women.
Do you get many visitors?
By chance, I found a hot spring.
I wrote the note.
Give me a drink.
I'm so sorry that I lied to you.
No one knows the fact.
There are so many.
I'm uncomfortable.
That's just what I wanted to hear.
He went there in person.
I made my decision.
I'm a beginner, too.
If you're happy, I'm glad.
What do you think of Mary's new dress?
That's a good response.
Japan is a country that is completely surrounded by oceans.
She asked him to read it for her because she had lost her glasses.
The cat jumped onto the table.
I want to do this on my own.
Have you betrayed me?
I finished the work yesterday.
Please come.
I saw nothing.
Do you have bread for lunch?
That's Tom's apartment.
The dog looks sick.
The gate needs to be closed.
I have settled on green for the curtains.
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
Tom said he heard the gunshots.
They are well looked after.
I've known her for more than twenty years.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
The captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship.
No one was injured.
The trouble is that we have no money.
She had a narrow escape yesterday.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
I want to get to know you.
I don't understand what that means.
Try it again.
Did I say something wrong?
Do you know the reason?
I hate this job sometimes.
This made me very sad.
We work from nine to five.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I did my job.
Please remain seated.
This is a wonderful book.
He's going to join our club.
I want to go swimming with Tom.
Tom weighs himself every morning.
I need something to eat.
He's pushing fifty.
Don't you think it's risky?
Tom wants to talk to Mary.
That's as good a place as any.
Isn't he a little young?
You're a filthy liar!
I have something to talk over with you.
What's your favorite spectator sport?
Tom is already back.
Get me a chair, please.
Her hobby is bodybuilding.
I'm walking beside her.
Any paper will do.
I want to go somewhere on a trip.
Were you able to do everything you wanted to get done?
He gave me an apple.
Tom isn't a huge football fan.
It's for you to decide.
He had just arrived.
Tom forgot to tell Mary what needed to be done.
I had a toothache yesterday.
It can't wait until tomorrow.
My father was an actor.
I messed up.
You look familiar.
I strongly suggest that you study harder.
You love your wife, right?
We left by train.
I think you need a vacation.
Tom wondered how long it would take to finish the job.
I don't want there to be any misunderstanding.
I'd like to eat.
What did you just write in your notebook?
You'll be all right.
Why am I still alive?
I'm not sure if Tom can speak French.
Tom is likely to be enjoying that.
We're just tired.
Tom did his best, but he failed.
Could we have a table in the corner?
I felt bad afterwards.
I wish I were as smart as you are.
He can leave tomorrow.
I wish I knew what to say.
How much money does he make a month?
I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I heard the news.
This CD is my son's.
Who could have spread that news?
It's better than the movie.
You've lost your marbles.
There is a cottage beyond the bridge.
That's not love.
He passed away quite suddenly.
I can't even think about it.
I've been tricked.
It is not necessary for you to quit the job.
He threatened me, but I wasn't scared.
We're punctual.
My parents caught me smoking.
I'll call back in twenty minutes.
He likes being surrounded by young people.
I hope to get away from Tokyo for a few days.
Your shoes are dirty.
Was there a lot of traffic?
Where did you get that?
Are you going to eat those fries?
Do you think English is difficult?
He took a week off.
Are you still sleepy?
He was passive by nature.
He gave me a cold.
I expect your help.
Many students have failed the test.
I love it here.
He has a deep affection for his son.
I think this is a waste of time.
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
Show me something new.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I lost the door key, so I can't enter the house.
He tore his ligament.
Are they cops?
How could it not bother you?
We'd better hurry then.
My wife is three years younger than I am.
The man blushed like a boy.
I can't blame him.
This place is boring.
I disregarded it.
Our project didn't get off the ground until he joined the company.
Nobody's forcing you to do anything.
He wanted to see a bullfight, but his father wouldn't let him go.
You could come and live with me.
I'm really happy for you.
When will you get through with work?
That's why I'm giving it to you.
It's easy to make and it's cheap.
Tom is wearing a black tie.
I got up earlier than usual to catch the first train.
I wonder how much we'll have to pay.
You don't seem very pleased.
I'm not sure that'll happen.
You need to be more careful from now on.
He recommended this dictionary to me.
He can drive a car.
Please correct my bill.
I'm dying for a beer!
What a terrific idea!
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
You must not stay up late.
There's nothing more I can tell you.
I liked what you said at the meeting.
I love you the best of all.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
To become a professional banjo player, you need to spend thousands of hours practicing.
I think you're on the right track.
I'm not disorganized.
You're arrogant.
He speaks French fluently.
I have no idea how to use this thing.
I should've known it was you.
The wind is blowing very hard.
How did you get out of your room?
The meeting was all but over.
Mary isn't Tom's wife.
This soup is too salty to eat.
Mary is Tom's daughter-in-law.
I didn't know Tom was going to Boston with Mary.
Bring me a moist towel.
He works all night.
I don't have any ideas at this time.
Tom knew how to talk to women.
Tom didn't remember where he'd put his pen.
I think what Tom is doing is worthwhile.
Not everybody wants to be an artist.
It's just a little further.
Doing it that way will take a long time.
Did you see anybody else?
Everybody's tired.
You work too hard.
Don't eat too much.
This word has two meanings.
I insist on being paid in advance.
I'm fed up with English.
You're famous.
I knew you would do something great.
Who listens to Tom?
Is that what Tom meant?
Do you want beef or pork?
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
I'm anxious to see you.
Tom doesn't like to stay at home.
You have a good memory.
At last he attained his goal.
Let's get a picture of us together.
Words cannot express the extent to which you are wrong.
Ten people were slightly injured in the accident.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner.
Let's take a rest.
He was satisfied with his new car.
If it gets boring, I'll go home.
Get on your feet.
That's not my concern.
I need to think of my children.
You're a good man.
Tom found something.
We gave it to the man.
We've never been to Boston.
She ran across her old friend while walking in the park.
Please tell Tom Mary called.
I told you I don't know how to do that.
He removed his shirt.
It's really cool here.
Who broke it?
I beg you to stay.
I disposed of my old coat.
You're going too fast.
Everybody laughed at Tom.
It was a coincidence.
He had to find another way.
It's not our responsibility.
I'd be happy to show it to you.
He has recently made remarkable progress in English.
Your suitcase is too heavy.
She devoted herself to him.
I got divorced.
Today I don't feel like doing anything.
I was miserable without you.
May I use your toilet?
Could you speak more slowly?
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
He's waiting for you at home.
I got nothing.
I drink tea, too.
I am not acquainted with him.
Leaves fall in the autumn.
Can you wait until 2:30 this afternoon?
I said I was sad.
Tom says we can park on either side of the street.
He's afraid of making mistakes.
People are complicated.
I've only seen it once.
She showed them how to fasten their seat belts.
Where do we even begin?
Drop your weapons!
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
We only want you.
What a nice tie!
I'll never leave you alone again.
You can't just not show up.
Given her interest in children, I am sure teaching is the right career for her.
After work, I go right home.
Enjoy the show.
Please sit here.
He is so honest that everybody trusts him.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I like these two.
Where is everybody?
Keep focused on your work.
How much is it?
We all enjoyed the movie.
I watched a movie yesterday afternoon.
It's disappointing.
What does this image make you think of?
Mary is a very attractive girl.
Is this your money?
I know what you know.
You can't do two things at once.
Why did the prices go down?
Tom was like a father to me.
The world has changed a lot in the last thirty years.
We were fully satisfied.
What subject do you think he is interested in?
Tom really loves his country.
You look just like your mother.
You should stay.
Don't talk back to me like that.
What took you so long?
No one told us anything.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
If you're happy, I'm glad.
She is accustomed to doing her homework before dinner.
She speaks English really well.
Tom is confused and scared.
He didn't succeed in explaining what he wanted.
I couldn't hear Tom.
Put the flour on the shelf.
Anyway, I did my best.
He can't control himself.
He never seems to grow older.
Don't talk in the classroom.
Tom shouldn't make fun of Mary.
It's a good deal.
Tom arrived at the hotel.
My attitude towards him changed.
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
My father is sweeping the garage.
There was not enough fuel.
There is a letter for you.
It was extremely weird.
I knew Tom would sing that song.
You shouldn't be in here.
I want to tell you about my problems.
Mary promised her mother that she would help her more often.
He is well acquainted with French literature.
I did it like this.
It's a good sign.
It was heartless of him to say such a thing to the sick man.
I'm as shocked as you are.
The library will issue you a library card.
Go somewhere else. I want to be alone.
I would be more careful if I were you.
I gave Tom detailed instructions.
We're making a big mistake, you know.
The pond has dried up.
We're really good.
Those who use forks or chopsticks often think people who don't are uncivilized.
Why don't you try doing that again?
I'll pay you tomorrow.
I wish I had more time to talk with her.
I wanted you to win.
All the children started crying.
You should relax a bit.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
My mom walked into my room.
I want to know who was in charge.
I'm looking forward to visiting your country this winter.
I know who it is you're looking for.
That wouldn't help me.
Why did you do this to me?
Don't worry about it, OK?
Please tell me you're kidding.
Is there a woman in your life?
They showed me a lot of nice pictures.
I have a lot of dreams.
I'm not coming back here.
Did anyone see you there?
Please forgive me.
Can I borrow a pen? Mine's on its last legs.
She was very happy with my gift.
He got off the bus.
Who taught you French?
The police are looking for the robber.
They burned.
Get in the car.
I wasn't asleep.
Is he tall?
Tom trusts you.
I think Tom is courageous.
This is really delicious soup, isn't it?
Tom makes more money than Mary.
Do you mind if I ask you a question?
I want to keep one.
My eyes are tired.
Why do you need them?
It's your bedtime.
You'd do the same for me.
I'll make this up to you.
We spend a third of our lives sleeping.
That was a lot of fun.
May I bother you for a moment?
How many nights will you stay?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Please give me a hamburger.
They were satisfied with the result.
It is difficult to prove that ghosts exist.
I had a horrible childhood.
He pretended to be asleep.
My father doesn't drink. "Neither does my father."
I use the Internet as a resource for my research.
What was your first tattoo?
I can't get over how different the weather is here.
What is the news?
I have to cook the vegetables.
A fire can spread faster than you can run.
The sun doesn't shine at night.
A winter sport that many people enjoy is ice skating.
I will get in touch with you.
It's something they always wanted to do.
I'm from Singapore.
I just remembered something I have to do before tomorrow morning.
As far as I know, Tom is still married.
I'm not good enough for you.
It fits on a single floppy disk.
We accept all major credit and debit cards.
I knew I could do it.
It's the rule, not the exception.
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
I'm not going to go to school today.
Which are the best ones?
Everything went as planned.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Don't worry about me so much.
I want to go outside for a breath of fresh air.
We hope to do better this week.
I guess you know I've missed you.
The children were playing in the park.
Don't confuse the two.
Be careful, Tom!
The air is pure around here.
Divide and conquer.
I'd like to join you.

He is most likely to succeed.
What's the name of that fat girl you used to date in high school?
Don't feed the dog.
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
Everyone would like to believe that dreams can come true.
I'm free every day but Monday.
If you want, you can easily do it.
How much did that cost?
I want to be with you.
I had to walk because there were no taxis.
About how many hours does it take by car?
Is it hard to fool you?
As far as I know, I'm in perfect health.
Did you buy a gun?
Discretion is the better part of valor.
I'd like to find a French-speaking doctor.

Where are they meeting?
I can't even remember my own name.
I'll put some salt on the meat.
He is the father of three children.
I saw you there.
Do you remember saying that?
He rarely stays home on Sunday.
How long were you gone?
You're the teacher.
I hate cops like him.
You need to follow me.
He stood gazing at the painting.
Tom has confidence in his own ability.
Where will you be?
These are counterfeit.
Tom is still living in Australia.
Everybody ought to do that.
It's really cold today.
I just want to make sure we all agree.
I have a bruise.
The rule should be revised.
Tom washes clothes three times a week.
Why didn't you call somebody?
Everyone here except you has done that.
Anyone can make a mistake.

He contracted malaria while living in the jungle.
Why don't you run for student council?
Are you sure it was Tom?
Her ability to write with her foot is amazing.
Correct the underlined words.
Tom doesn't have to eat this.
Compare your translation with his.
As far as I know, that never happened.
I enjoyed it.
I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.

I think it's unlikely that any store would sell this model for that price.
I have a good appetite this morning.
I taught my wife how to drive.
That seems unlikely.
I need something to eat.
I don't get the point.
I didn't know you could cook this well.
Who forced you to do that?
It must be difficult to do that.
I'm drafting a plan.
Excuse us for a minute.
That would take too long.
Tom was startled by a knock on the door.
I understood the message.
Who taught you French?
Can you help her out before they catch her?
I consider you one of my closest friends.
You may choose whichever you want.
I wish I could give up smoking.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
You can give me the details later.
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
We have precious little time.
They were unimpressed.
Tom seems very distant today.
She is remarkably attractive.
It's not very good.
That is all.
I've never met him.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
Can you at least pretend you're enjoying yourself?
You had better ask him which way to take.
We have to take the stairs.
Don't call Tom at his home after 2:30.
This place is really windy.
Tom wants children, but Mary doesn't.
The women have umbrellas.
I have a classmate who says he can speak French fluently.
That's all they had.
Do you want to go to the zoo?
I do want to go with you.

We still have a lot to discuss.

We'll have to take that risk.
I want to show you something in the office.
If it weren't for music, the world would be a boring place.
Terrific!

There were bullet holes in the windshield.
That's a reliable approach.

I don't want you to go.
Keep this information under your hat.
I didn't kiss Tom.
I handled it.
Who did you go with?
You'd better not argue with Tom.
I felt guilty about it.
I still don't feel safe.
Maybe you should have a little talk with Tom.
You are too young to travel alone.
We're open tomorrow night.
You need to rest.
We're smashed.
I'm adding the last touch.
You're the leader.
He makes everybody feel at ease.
It's hard to throw things out.
Wonderful!
Let's see you talk your way out of this one.
My book bag is very heavy.

I'll become stronger.
When do the shops open?
They gave us very little trouble.
I'm not here for you.
What's your favorite way to travel?
I got lost in the snow.
She is particular about what she wears.

I'm afraid I have no experience.
I'm not wearing that stupid costume.
The principal shook hands with each of the graduates.
Do you live here?
Please refrain from smoking here.
She walked around looking for him.
I'd forgotten that.
You should've told me this before.
I'm sure a lot of people would agree with you.
We'll do more than that.
Nobody had to tell Tom. He already knew.
I can't carry all that baggage.
I never drink coffee with milk.
Nobody knows his name.
I don't need it.
That has allowed the creation of 4.000 new jobs.
I hate it when my clothes smell like cigarettes.
Now it's time to make amends.
How do you usually decide what to eat?

He's a liar.
I made up my mind to go there.
My apartment is more comfortable than yours.
Until you admit that you were wrong, I'm not going to talk to you.
Tom is in big trouble.
I really hope you can come.
That one is all yours.
Somebody is eating.
We're not going to make it.
Warm this morning, isn't it?

They kept drinking.
Whose fault is that?

I'm forgetful.
It's a very delicate subject.
Everything happened too quickly.
He treated me badly.
It seems quiet enough.
There must be an easier way to do this.
I don't even want to know.
She got wet to the skin.
You are very beautiful.
When would it be convenient for you?
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
Why were they scared?
You're conceited.
I caught him cheating on the exam.
She really ate too much.
The water is rising.
Hold the elevator, Tom.
I have a plan.
He consoled himself with the thought that it might have been worse.

I have to admit that you're right.
Please hurry. I don't have all night.

I must protest.
Tom has never seen a UFO.
You should take care of yourself.

Tell me you're not serious!
I heard it on the news today.
The pain is getting worse.

How can you be so sure of that?
She likes birdwatching.
Did anyone visit me during my absence?
He is respected by everyone.
Any book will do.
She arrived late as usual.
What did you do that for?
Please turn off the light before you go to bed.

Tell me what you see.
What do you say to going out for a short walk?
I don't like being on my own.
Don't you ever come back.
I can't stand fishing.
I'd like to come along.
I wasn't too sure about it.
I had a good time, too.
You've done a lot of good.

I have already started my vacation.
It's a complete sham.
I apologize to all of you.
What a treasure!
Tom was the life of the party.
Tom felt safe.
We go to Boston as often as we can.
He said that he would help me.
We're closed.
Help me, please.
I really need the money.
I was scared, of course.
Why don't I call you?
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
It's a good system.
Well, what did you find out?
Are you scared of me?
The rest of them will come soon.

I've lost my glasses.
Where is the Red Cross?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to stay at home.

Maybe that's the reason.
I haven't been able to solve the problem yet.
What're you all dressed up for?
Tom asked Mary to speak to you.
This is how I made it.
Comb your hair before you go out.

Something changed.
My grandkids live in Boston.
What's in the package?
These socks do not match.
Name and address, please.
I just want a little more of that.
Empty the water out of the bucket.
Are you afraid of me?
It's a small noisy apartment, but it's where I live and I call it home.
That's the house I stayed in.
I brought a present for you.
He stiffed me for fifty bucks.
I suggest we get moving.
There's no need to call a doctor.
Can you validate this parking ticket?
There's very little paper left.
Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?
Work slowly.
Tom did everything he could for his children.
This book will give you a clear idea of the American way of life.
Since the Industrial Revolution, the world population has more than tripled.
Do you know what it was?
I'll leave Tom alone.
I'll stay in Boston until October 20th.
If anyone can do it, you can.
He did it all out of kindness.
Don't you just love a mystery?
Attendance is free.
That made me very sad.
I have plenty of ideas.
Look at these prices.
Coffee keeps me awake.
Can you check if the phone is out of order?
You look familiar.
I understand how hard this is.
Please turn off the radio.
I doubt it'll be very hard for you to get your driver's license.
It didn't happen that way.
You don't have to read the whole thing from beginning to end.

Now I'll add the finishing touch.
Who is on duty?
Could you stop, please?
Does she like oranges?
I sometimes feel drowsy in the early afternoon.
How many symphonies did Beethoven write?
Was this your idea?

I'm sorry about last night.
I'm loyal.
I'm dripping with sweat.
That plane is enormous!
They could only listen.
She went to see him the other day.
You don't know Tom as well as you think you do.
I didn't mean any of it.
Are you the one who saved me?
Are you injured?
I'm afraid of drowning.
At home, we speak only French.
I came here to give you a gift.
No one was fired.
I'd like to try this.

I hear your childish laughter.
Is this your first investigation?
Why do you study?
Tell me which one to choose.
Stop harassing me.
How come the guys I want never want me?
Men do not exist in this world to become rich, but to become happy.

Something was wrong.
My son came to my room.
You are important.
You have a good lawyer.
Tom didn't want Mary to move to Boston.
Who does the cooking at your house?
Astronomy is an expensive hobby.
Your answer is correct.
Tom had a traumatic experience.
You should not break your promise.
You're very emotional.
They all deserve to die.
Tom's mother is Canadian.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
I never drink coffee with milk.
He is reading a book.
At that time, she was bathing in the sun.
Please be polite.
You must kneel at my feet, kiss my hand and swear that I am an angel.
We're missing something here.
Where did you get that scar?
I was born and brought up in Tokyo.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
She has improved her skill in cooking recently.
Why are you being weird?
I got lost.
Tom could have told me the truth.
Let's go to the vegan restaurant.
Hey, where are you?
I don't like anything.
The young lady carried a child in her arm.
I won't return.
My cousin has a large collection of action figures.
You've risked enough.
What time did you arrive there?
Everyone makes mistakes.
He wrote a lot of stories.
That's an interesting choice.
Can you ride a horse?
There isn't any hope.
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
You have to go on without me.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
How long does it take to walk to your house from here?
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
The police will be here any minute.
I guess I'd better start packing.
If the weather is good, I'll go.
How many people are still down there?

Let's split.
Would you like to come to my party?
We're sorry we can't help you.
What do you think of it?
She got through her work before five.

Are you willing to make a deal?
Why would she go out of her way to help a deadbeat like you?

I understand how much you want to go to the party, but I can't let you go.
They found us.
That sounds like something you would do.
Got it?

If that guitar weren't so expensive, I could buy it.
We'll talk about that later.

Anybody want a beer?
Tom is a former student of mine.
He fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident.
Do me a favor.
Tom drove Mary to the nearest hospital.
I am a stranger here.
If you don't know anything about computers, you're really behind the times.
I'm old enough.
Take a seat.
She has never seen him.
There are several forms of government.
She ended up getting married to him.
Tom bolted the door.
Just keep moving.
He looked over my report.
You shouldn't get near my dog while he's eating.
Can you watch my stuff for a minute?
I wanted to speak to you about this.
I was struck by lightning.
It's what I want to do.
I've done many stupid things in my life.
Unless you stop fighting, I'll call the police.
They never really told me.
What are you crunching on?
Is that bothering you?
It's rather impressive.
Many children were playing in the park.
This is not good.
I'm fed up with her.
As always, you have understood poorly!
I think Tom liked it.
Don't tell me who I like.
The man looked at me.
Lie on your right side.
We're crazy about each other.
It's the best job in the world!
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
I'm glad to hear that.
Do any of you have a pencil?
Are you happy now?
I can't do this again.
He is riding a bicycle.
She walked slowly away from me.
I got my leg hurt in the accident.
Do you think I'm qualified for that job?
Do you know how my friends describe me?
Whose is this bicycle?
Where was Tom born?
Take your shot.
I think Tom hates me.
Tom is a journalist.
He made mistake after mistake.
Tom is just joking.
I don't know what that is.
I need to get back to the hospital.
I went to the zoo yesterday.
He has started acting strangely.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
What did you do today?
You're taking advantage of her weakness.
I was ready.
Do you want to leave today?
What is it you have against Tom?
Are you kidding?
Can I rely on you?
I left Tom three messages.
Please move the desk to the left.
Tom wasn't as fast as I was.
She seemed uninterested.
My parents live in the country.
You're so sweet.
Sleep is necessary for good health.
What do you think of these?
He doesn't mean to be mean. It's just his nature.
He hurried on to make up for lost time.
Tom doesn't think before he speaks.
You're not very organized, are you?
I hope you don't mind.
I've never seen you like this.
You can't swim here.
What's your plan?
I assure you this isn't just about money.
What could be the meaning of it?
I'm very proud of our students.
I don't care about the money.
As a boy, he would go to the seaside every summer.
You could do it if you really wanted to.
I need a mouse pad.
When was Tom fired?
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
I cut myself while shaving.
How long did you stay there?
I always knew this could happen.
I lit the match.
You're right on time.
They followed you here.
He lives at the top of the hill.
She has done her homework.
The boy was accompanied by his parents.
Excuse me, can I have a word with you?
I'm going to be a father.
Have you ever been run over?
Tom doesn't speak French, and neither do I.
Welcome back.
Besides lending books, libraries offer various other services.
They are all very happy.
You must respect your elders.
I was forced to go.
This is my third marriage.
I didn't even know you spoke French.
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
What happens if I press this button?
Pump up the tire.
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
Go ahead and take one.
You read too much.
I can't believe you're still hungry.
I hadn't planned to tell you about what happened last night.
While in London, he visited the British Museum.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
I recognized the name.
You should go out and have some fun.
You're early.
Are you in a bad mood?
You don't know that.
Even wounds that have healed, leave scars behind.
I'm a little behind schedule.
Did you phone me?
Tom inherited the business from his father.
Anyone can write his own name.
Is that why they died?
The kitchen lacks a dishwasher.
What's your maiden name?
That's a lame excuse.
A car drew up in front of my house.
She often goes to the movies with him.
I have been to the library.
The leaves are turning red.
I need a lawyer.
How fast can you do it?
What a wonderful invention!
I think we can.
I hate coffee.
Tom should probably tell Mary he's sorry.
Please knock on the door.
I'm sick of English.
I'm so sorry that I lied to you.
I came to Japan from China.
Arabic is written from right to left.
You're a good guitarist. "I'd like to think I am."
He's not in.
I need to ask you a favor.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
If you want to talk, let's talk.
We'd better go back in.
I've given you everything you've asked for.
Does that seem fair to you?
Tie your shoe.
I was talking to you.
I want to make some changes.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Can I talk to you in private for a minute?
Can I get a copy of that?
Sorry for calling you so early.
They're brave.
Everything is under control.
He should get to the office in an hour.
He accumulated his fortune by hard work.
There are a lot of places to see around here.
You can't rely on his help.
She smiled at him uneasily.
Have you finished?
We caught you.
I went to bed early because I was tired.
A beautiful girl sat next to me.
When I heard that, I started to cry.
You need help doing that, I think.
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not good at telling jokes.
Let's watch something else.
Is today Monday?
I'll leave this with you.
He donated a lot of money.
I wondered what time the concert would begin.
I like it.
I feel so bad.
I'm too poor to marry her.
You'd be the one to know.
I have made up my mind to achieve my goals in three years.
What was her answer to your proposal?
I don't feel that guilty.
You're very emotional.
Is my explanation clear?
You're very busy.
How could you do that?
I wrote some poems last weekend.
A computer is an absolute necessity now.
You're quite attractive.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
He gave a positive answer to my question.
What do you really think?
Yes, I was, said the student.
The locking mechanism has jammed.
He devoted a lot of time to study.
He is a man of wisdom.
The house stank.
It's not worth the effort.
I don't have your wit.
I'm wealthy.
Tom isn't really sick. He's just pretending to be.
Don't let appearances fool you.
The curtain rose.
Who's your teacher?
They were wealthy.
From tomorrow on, I'll get up earlier.
Shouldn't Tom be in jail?
I really do appreciate it.
I suppose it's time to go.
I'd like a gin and tonic.
I'm grateful.
We need to get out of here.
You always said you wanted to become a scientist. Why didn't you?
Don't get too excited.
Did you enjoy yourself?
Tom changes his mind a lot.
Experts have failed to come up with an explanation of why the explosion happened.
He never speaks unless spoken to.
It's wrong to deceive people, but worse to deceive yourself.
Terrific!
Can foreign students be in the club?
We meant no harm.
Tom is very independent-minded.
He teaches mathematics as well as English.
He did the work on his own.
Summer is slow in coming this year.
Do you want to eat something?
I can speak English.
He helped poor people all his life.
I wonder where to hang the picture he gave me.
This is official.
Wake the kids.
Where's everyone else?
I need it immediately.
Tom said he wanted to talk to me.
He wants you to come home.
They are running now.
Help me print this.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
We're meant for each other.
I think it's time for me to stop allowing her to always have her own way.
I don't know what to do.
He is satisfied with the result.
Why does it take them so long to set up my internet connection?
Do we have enough food?
Everybody's safe.
There are exceptions to every rule.
I am familiar with this subject.
Don't worry about it.
I made a fool of myself.
You're very emotional.
Her car is two years old.
Welcome back.
There's plenty of light.
Why would I want to do that?
Tom built a castle in the sand.
He made up his mind to be a pilot.
The bus was empty except for one elderly woman.
You're exhausted.
The moment she was alone, she opened the letter.
He denied the rumor.
I appreciate your telling me this face-to-face.
Tom is already on the plane.
No one is too old to learn French.
A car hit Tom.
You will never defeat me!
He's a bartender.
He tried to put the fragments of a broken vase together.
She confronted him and demanded an apology.
Several plans were proposed.
He will come in a moment.
What do you say to playing cards?
I didn't know Tom liked me.
She has already left the office.
We're glad to see you.
He is a gentleman. He cannot have said such a thing.
We're not out of the woods yet.
I made hotel reservations one month in advance.
You have chosen the best.
You should follow Tom's example.
Tom is not a very friendly guy.
Please take some of them.
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you.
Can I use your dictionary? "Yes, here you are."
Lunch is ready.
He put the book on the shelf.
Are you retarded or something?
This is a very time-consuming task.
Look both ways before you cross the street.
She bought a handkerchief for ten dollars.
Do not do that.
There will be an energy crisis in the near future.
Tom is going to go to Boston next weekend.
I have three cats.
There are cases where honesty doesn't pay.
They forgot to lock the door.
I have an interest in cello and piano.
We're not done playing yet.
Can I help you find something?
Let me take my coat off.
That's why I'm here today.
He always cries when he is drunk.
You can hang out with us if you want.
We should've warned Tom of the danger.
Tom is not a hero.
We have no secrets from each other.
Since it was already late, I went to sleep.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
I do not like wearing anybody else's clothes.
Please don't walk on the grass.
Give me a break.
He is inclined to look at everything from the standpoint of its practicality and is neither stingy nor extravagant.
We took turns with the driving.
Where do you live now?
Have you ever lived in Boston?
Nothing can be worse than that.
Kissing one's spouse in public is considered acceptable behavior in some countries.
I'm studying French grammar.
Don't eat between meals.
I heard screaming.
Take a look.
Do you know me?
Give me three pieces of chalk.
I know you'll make the right decision.
Are you accusing me of cheating?
Do you think I'm that stupid?
The boy stayed quiet.
Don't be such a jerk.
We eat soup with a spoon.
The town is two miles away from the coast.
I just needed some water.
Whatever you do, don't smile.
She spent all afternoon cooking.
Tom is an old friend of mine from high school.
I warned you not to come here.
A devastating earthquake hit the state capital.
I want three pairs of socks.
I'll show you the way out.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
She's too old for you.
Try not to be so tense.
Have they arrived yet?
It's worth a try.
I think it's time for me to retire.
You don't want to go to prison, do you?
I'm meeting Tom at the station at 2:30.
This is all your fault.
You're very resourceful.
There are a lot of things I want to ask you.
I could tutor you.
The company announced hundreds of layoffs.
I didn't think anybody was coming.
The small dog crossed the road.
Is this a joke?
You said you were busy.
She adores him.
Where can I go to buy art books and catalogs?
Just tell me what happened.
Tom seems to be unwilling to lower the price.
I sympathize.
It's completely my fault.
I'm not used to this kind of work.
I was born on June 4, 1974.
Tom bought a book.
Don't rely on him.
Some of them were wounded.
He goes abroad every year.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
I can look at it when you're ready.
Tom studies French as well.
I may be able to come to your office Monday afternoon.
It's good to talk to you.
Osaka is Japan's second largest city.
I forgot to buy eggs.
Tom sealed the deal.
The plants suffered damage from the frost.
I know both of the girls.
If you can't come, you should let me know ahead of time.
He will be here all evening.
He wore a light blue tie.
I don't know what I owe you.
He bought a bottle of cheap wine.
By then, however, it was too late.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
I told you I'm the best.
The cool air felt wonderful on my face.
I don't know why Tom didn't want us there.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
I'm very sad to hear that.
He has ants in his pants.
It's nice to be needed.
The sun will soon set.
None of us knew the answer.
There are only two days left.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
What do you think you'll do next?
They are my friends.
He's a bigot.
They cheat.
My mother was furious.
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
I never stop thinking about you.
Tell me what to do.
Tom stole Mary's phone and took a bunch of selfies before sneaking it back into her purse.
We're lucky to be alive.
I'm asking you as a friend.
The admiral is never satisfied.
He failed the entrance exam.
What do you need me to do?
Try it again.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
When are you going to finish this?
You are probably wrong.
What a pity it is that you can't come!
She met her uncle at the shop.
Please pull the rope.
Her gray hair makes her look older than her age.
Don't believe everything you hear.
That couldn't happen.
It is ten o'clock by my watch.
I don't have to apologize for what I said.
Everyone got sick.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
She is knitting a sweater.
I know almost nothing about it.
Rainy days make me depressed.
What do you look like?
You never know what life may throw your way.
That makes sense.
I remember the year when he got a job.
They went to America last month.
He made an apology.
I have no home to return to.
Who is the tall guy with long dark hair playing the guitar?
What's inside?
No one will ever find you.
His brother passed away last month.
I'm not that desperate yet.
Where's the shopping center?
Hope of finding the child alive is fading rapidly.
You look good in white.
Did you enjoy that?
I deactivated my Twitter account yesterday.
I hope you won't mind.
I knew Tom had lied to us.
He is my brother, not father.
There was nothing that I could do but wait for him.
Many people believe acupuncture can cure diseases.
None of them said anything.
I have said no such thing.
Why are you whispering?
I've never seen this kind of thing happen before.
What results do you anticipate?
Hey. What's going on?
You can't trust computer translation.
Do you have my money or not?
You're not welcome here.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
No way!
We know you're interested.
I'll put some coffee on.
Animals act according to their instincts.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
A good many people have told me to take a holiday.
It's common courtesy.
I'd like to be friends.
Tom finished the job in three days.
He was killed in the war.
Your place is by my side.
Have you heard the latest rumors?
Do you know something I don't know?
Be as specific as possible.
Tom and Mary are uncomfortable.
They're boys.
I just love bargain sales.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
You didn't tell me Tom smoked.
Health means everything.
I was kind of a chubby kid.
I think Tom may be dead.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
Which way did you choose?
Can I get you a drink?
I'm concentrating.
Tom lowered the bucket into the well.
What do you have to add to 17 to get 60?
I really miss you.
The reason is that I want to be an English teacher.
I'm sick and tired of reading.
I know an American girl who speaks Japanese very well.
We should obey the rules.
I'm letting you go.
Prices have gone down.
I'll be checking on you.
I hate all of them.
I work different hours every day.
I want you to take back what you said just now.
How hungry are you?
I need to know.
I bathe every day.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
Tom didn't want to go to the doctor.
See if my answer is correct.
I'm just a little bored.
I just want what I was promised.
I don't know if I have enough money.
Please be careful.
He screwed up his courage and proposed to her.
I thought if I broke up with you, I'd never have to see you again.
I look forward to watching you dance.
You are the only one who can help me.
I don't think I can help you.
That's very easy.
We'll have plenty of time.
I'm so happy.
I am very grateful to you for your help.
Family is family.
A party will be held next Saturday, that is to say, on August 25th.
Which applications do you like best?
He has a beautiful tan.
I think that doing would be a mistake.
I came here to meet you.
She has many valuable books.
Mother divided the cake into eight pieces.
And what happened after that?
I am thinking of resigning at once.
I hate the way I look.
Be careful!
May I ask you a personal question?
Unfortunately, it's raining today.
I can't go.
I appreciate all your advice.
She taught him everything she knew.
Have you already eaten?
It was a mistake.
Why aren't you doing your homework?
I can't believe I'm here again.
Tom hasn't read the book yet.
He is capable of doing it.
Tom hates to lose.
He didn't get paid for it.
The sun always rises in the east.
The body and the mind of man are so closely bound together that whatever affects one affects the other.
Your friends are late.
I think we can handle that.
I respect you for what you have done.
The corporal is on furlough.
Take mine.
Accidents happen.
My house is tiny.
Everything must be handled very carefully.
Tom walked towards the stairs.
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
I did what I thought I should do.
I feel bad for that guy.
A nuclear war will bring about the destruction of mankind.
She has a flower in her hand.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Do you have many friends here in Japan?
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
This might interest you.
What should they do in this situation?
Is something happening?
How did you all get here?
She isn't married.
Are there others like you?
I used to have a dog.
Was it your idea to postpone the meeting?
I'm not doing anything different.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
He asked me what I needed.
Tom looks very happy.
Compared to last summer, we haven't had so much rain this year.
That's what I was going to say.
That's very considerate of you.
I don't remember it.
Are you going to work until 10:00?
Are you still upset about what happened?
Open the door, please.
You should be more careful the next time.
Would you like a sandwich?
No pain, no gain.
He stressed the convenient aspects of city life.
Did I wake you?
No way!
I'm invited to Tom's party tonight.
You are the chosen one.
Tom bought a present for Mary.
Could you give me a lift to the train station?
It was his decision.
You can't just not do your job.
That's why I'm giving you this.
We're classmates.
I can't see.
They're not here yet.
I've never had to fire anyone before.
I apologize for the delay in replying.
I must admit that I was mistaken.
The population of Tokyo is greater than that of London.
Do you want to go tell Tom about this?
We bought this in Australia.
You can always count on Tom.
Tom would never agree to that.
Suddenly, it started to rain very hard.
Why did it have to be us?
Your ideas about the government are different from mine.
Didn't it occur to you to shut the windows?
That's upsetting.
Tom caught a trout.
We're just tired.
You will soon cease to think of her.
We had no choice but to call the police last night.
You are twice as strong as I am.
He took the coat off because it was warm.
Any apartment will do as long as the rent is reasonable.
That's OK.
I had nothing to do with that.
Which plan do you believe is better?
Are you the group leader?
I'm not going out because I have to do my homework.
Would you like another cup of tea?
I am sure that he will become a great singer.
I suppose we could do that.
There is no sugar here.
Don't make me say it.
Who told you the story?
This letter was never meant to be sent.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
You may use my typewriter.
I feel sick every morning.
After hearing the tragic news, he went outside to be alone.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
Few people know about the plan.
I know Tom is a lazy kid.
I rechecked the data.
I've got to know.
He wouldn't believe us.
Luckily, Tom had some money I could borrow.
We're worried about Grandma and Grandpa.
Tom always walks to school.
Is there anyone else?
Follow Tom.
Enjoy your evening.
Oranges are sweeter than lemons.
I was horrified.
This is a very scary moment.
They keep calling.
I think Tom needs your help.
I also had a very good time.
No one can help.
What do you like about it?
Judge for yourself.
Are you still married?
I'm disgusted and disappointed.
It took a whole month to break in those new shoes.
I thought I recognized you.
How big you are!
Tom is guilty.
You haven't been a teacher very long, have you?
I told you that you weren't supposed to do it.
What did you say?
Tom translated the contract into French.
We mean business.
Don't you see what you're doing?
It wasn't much of a yard.
I don't know why you did it.
How many apples are there?
Am I going to be normal again?
I just want to finish this and leave.
What do you have planned for the afternoon?
Which is mine?
Once is not enough.
Were you really angry?
Who was this picture painted by?
See you at lunch.
I missed my flight.
My bike was stolen last night.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
You have a lot of nerve.
Why are you taking pictures?
Is anything broken?
I thought you were injured.
The dog should be on a chain.
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing.
I think Tom is following me.
We saw it on the news.
I don't like to inhale someone's smoke while I'm working.
What's your problem with straight people?
I spoke with Tom this morning.
Let's just try it.
Almost no one believed her.
He bought a car.
They never gave up.
I did what I had to.
The woman washes her face.
The letter was written by hand.
I will speak to her about it directly.
He was sleeping under the tree.
She became a doctor.
The boys are thirsty.
I myself will repair that machine.
If you flunk this exam, you'll have to repeat the course.
Tom has short hair.
Luck is against me.
When did you learn to swim?
She prepared a wonderful meal for us.
I'd like to remain anonymous.
I know Tom will be reasonable.
Please sit down!
I was born here.
I know I'm going to die.
Did I miss the turn?
I never wanted all this to happen.
I have to come on Monday.
They are gathering nuts.
I can't sleep well.
We will become happy in the long run.
Can you teach me how to do that?
He met an unexpected obstacle.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Where's the children's section?
Who should I inform?
Your ideas are always appreciated.
Mary thinks that the world is a dangerous place.
Hold the box with both hands.
How did that whole thing happen?
The car ran into a tree.
Here's to your health!
I'm glad to see you here.
How many did you get?
Watch out! This monkey is vicious.
Do you speak Japanese?
Tom hasn't read the morning paper yet.
I spent the whole day in reading the novel.
I want the money you owe me and I want it now.
What could they possibly want from us?
Why don't you ask your boyfriend?
Guess who else moved to Boston.
Don't climb on this!
I'm too sick to work.
They'll be so happy to have Tom back.
Whoever told you such a ridiculous story?
I don't know who they are, but they don't look friendly.
He had few teeth.
So what are you talking about?
This is temporary.
I didn't even see you once last year.
He's a slowpoke.
I just want to be near you.
Could you give me some advice?
You were removed from the list.
I saw Tom sitting in the third row.
Take off your socks, please.
We'll start.
He came to school even though he was unwell.
I translated the poem the best I could.
I was looking for a pair of scissors.
Please delete this file.
I finally bought the toy.
We're unprejudiced.
I think it's time for me to go.
Thank you.
Tell me what's going on.
How old were you when you got married?
That's just what you needed.
I know Tom isn't very busy.
I am looking for a job, sir.
We need to discuss this further.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
You're wasting your time trying to convince Tom.
You've been suspended.
Tom likes to fish.
When I was a child, I used to go to the seashore every summer.
Several dozen young people participated in the demonstration.
He censured me for what I had done.
I'll never ask you this question again.
Can I take a break now?
You're not alone anymore.
I didn't want to spend any more time alone.
We accepted his offer.
I gather you were hurt.
This room is cold.
Let's go.
I haven't read today's newspaper yet.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
Am I hired?
I really just don't like Christmas music.
Tom often comes here.
I have a Canadian neighbor.
The wind is shifting.
Japan is in Asia.
I hate when this happens.
Pregnant women often experience morning sickness.
We have just a tiny bit of garden.
Why would you want that?
My mother is preparing breakfast.
That makes perfect sense to me.
Do you want a hand?
Mary is the most beautiful girl I know.
I love this one.
I hate waiting like this.
I didn't expect you to get here so soon.
How can I become rich?
I hear she's a famous actress.
Here he comes.
Give me the keys to your car.
Do you know CPR?
You're probably tired.
It reminded me of you.
Are you looking for me?
Why do you like squirrels so much?
Aren't you going to open the box?
I know now what we have to do.
I'm bad at swimming.
We haven't seen you in a while.
I don't do drugs.
I don't think you really believe that.
She hated him so much that our family could never go and visit him.
I'd like to speak to your manager.
You may speak to him.

Isn't life just great?

Did I get it right?
Well, have you decided?
I want you to read this book.
I've given up smoking.
I have a telescope.
Do you live near here?

It's all yours.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
I want to know who sent you.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
This is not my car.
Tom asked Mary if he could borrow her bicycle.
I'll stay out of your way.
You'll understand it right away.
They could still be here.
I hope everybody is on our side.
You're missing the point.
I do that sometimes.
Let's go straight to the beach.
Better a broken promise than none at all.
She'd never been this frightened before.
I can't do it right away.
Do you have any left in stock?

Guess who I am.

When is your book coming out?
Let's spread the map on the table and talk it over.
We're counting on you to help.
Can I call you again?
Tom could barely walk.
We have to do without sugar.
Cats catch mice.
He tumbled down the stairs.
This looks longer than that, but it is an optical illusion.
It was a huge difference.
Keep the meter running.
I don't think I'm the only one who noticed.
I lied about it.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
I'd rather do this without your help.

We may as well start at once.
There's something fishy going on.

He got engaged to my cousin.
What's it about?
You need to help me.
He raised his hat.
Will you join us?
She studies as hard as any student in her class.
I put it in the drawer.
Complaining won't change anything.
Actually it might be a good idea to start right now.
Wash your face and hands.
Please light a candle.
I was in the right place at the right time.
I'm not that kind of girl.
We gave Tom what he wanted.
We went to the video store.
I thought I was going crazy.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I'm no friend of yours.

It was getting dark, and, what made matters worse, it began to rain.
All we need is water.
Are you tired?

Why isn't Tom sleeping?
The windows were open.
She couldn't attend the morning church service.
He said he could swim well.
He said, "I will say nothing more, because I hate making excuses."
I want to enjoy this moment.
How do you stop this?
Are you an only child?
Tom went to Mary's house.
I want to see a doctor about my stomachache.
He is tall and handsome.
I'm reading things like famous novels which have been rewritten in simplified French.
Tom loves sports events.
She is not only intelligent but beautiful.
Where's the doctor?
I haven't eaten in four days.
Tom still doesn't understand.
Tom still hasn't found what he was looking for.
What makes you think I won't be able to do it?
The capital of Poland is Warsaw.
I want to go to Australia again before my passport expires.
I've spent way too much time thinking about this problem.

Where exactly did you go?
Tom was my first boyfriend.
Do you think she's pretty?
It's not clear when he came here.
I wish that Tom was here to help us.
Tom came here last night.
Where are the guards?
That's cheap, isn't it?
I think he will succeed.
Where did the accident take place?

I was sure of it.
Plants grow.
Unless I leave right away, I'll be late for my appointment.
Did you have fun at the party?
He was born in Athens in 1956.
It was a wild night.
Tom is always present.
I don't really understand the problem.
Tom's family lives in Australia.
I know it's not impossible.
You look just fine.
Which program did you watch yesterday?
I have no money, but I have dreams.
I think we have a problem.
They walked down the street singing a song.
What did you do with my pants?
I was counting on you.
She had a happy time with them.
The girl was busy making tea for her friend.
Tom knows almost nothing about Mary.
We're not looking.
Is there anything you want to add?
The test of the new engine takes place today.
She happened to have the day off.
Cleveland was not sure the boy was his son.
Trust me on that.
The food is delicious.
I'm not that worried.
Tom pretended to be rich.
You'd tell me the truth, wouldn't you?
Why don't you call Tom?
We can rely on his judgement.
You need to decide what kind of person you want to be.
Where would you like to go?
Are you sad? "No. Why would I be?"
I'm not sure this is necessary.
I'd like to do that now.
Give Tom one chance at least.
They are looking to you for help.
He has none of his father's aggressiveness.
He'll understand.
I can cook.
Tom asked Mary to sweep the floor.
He is a writer.
I have a daughter in high school.
She wants to go out with him.
I had a terrible dream last night.
Do you need any help doing that?
This is my house.
People learn from experience.
I wouldn't do that without you.
Aren't you satisfied?
I thought you'd got lost.
I just want to be clear.
This is such a waste of time.
I thought you'd got lost.
How did you burn your hand?
I had everything under control.
I wouldn't dream of letting you do that.
I was deeply impressed by Roman architecture.
He begged his father to buy him a bicycle.
I've never been in love before.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Go have fun.
Please have a drink.
Tom pushed Mary into doing that.
If I'd known what you were going to do, I'd've tried to stop you.
Tom is pretty smart.
I take a bath every day.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
Sorry I didn't reply sooner.
What's your hobby?
You're a horrible singer.
That's not what I said at all.
When's dinner served?
Do you want to look at it?
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
I've got to head back to work.
We weren't tired at all.
Bananas are a good source of potassium.
I know the reason that she quit her job.
He rolled his eyes.
She is buying books in the bookstore.
One of them is a spy.
I have no idea.
You should know yourself.
My father bought a new car.
It was very romantic.
Babies crawl before they walk.
Don't think about that anymore.
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
Please pass me the salt.
Did you get enough sleep?
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man.
I have three children.
Be calm.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
I never thought it would be this bad.
What's your favorite dessert?
Open your book to page ten.
Please be polite.
I have a lot of things I have to do before tomorrow.
I know that you and Tom are friends.
Get a good start by observing carefully.
Tom lives in Australia.
No one saw that.
You don't sound very optimistic.
I find you intriguing.
I am more than grateful to you for your help.
Now, what was your name again?
Tom returned the book to the library.
I'd like the bill, please.
Obviously, I was very shocked.
How's your old lady doing?
Don't forget us.
Do you think those are real?
She died yesterday.
Where is it hidden?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I think that girl cut her hair to give herself a new look.
Don't you think we deserve some answers?
She almost never does what she says she's going to do.
I have everything here that I need.
I love this store.
I'm not that stupid!
I didn't say it happened here.
He is responsible for the accident.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
It was a traumatic experience.
They saw us yesterday.
She said she would be back soon.
Tom taught Mary how to write songs.
Tom quickly figured it out.
It's too late for them.
He loves a banquet, provided he is not expected to make a speech.
We now come to the point.
The boy opened the window, although his mother told him not to.
Never tell me a lie again.
I'm shaken.
I see his house.
He is likely to win the game.
The keys were in my bag.
Mr. Jackson teaches us music.
All you do is complain.
What did they hit you with?
He has a strong sense of responsibility.
If you do that, everyone's going to hate you.
I don't have a TV at my place.
He's very fond of reading.
We're broke.
I have no desire to understand what goes on in your head.
The boy made his parents happy.
I read a magazine to kill time.
We heard the door close.
I must destroy you.
Do you know the reason?
It doesn't make a lot of sense.
It would be a shame to let all this food go to waste.
The house is in need of repair.
We're meant to be together.
I have to support a large family.
How did you know what I was thinking?
You're perfect for me.
Drink something.
Can cats really see in the dark?
Was there anybody else in the bar?
His success delighted his parents.
I didn't really want to win.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I read about him in the newspaper.
Tom killed Mary.
There's a garden in front of our house.
We are not alone.
Stop treating me like a child.
He seated himself beside her.
She sat beside me in church.
I got sand in my eye.
Everyone started arguing.
The apprentice is lazy.
Tom isn't a child.
I thought you didn't care about money.
Although they are twins, they have few interests in common.
Tom isn't my son.
What is there to be afraid of?
It depends on you.
Half of the apples Tom gave me were rotten.
Eat your spinach.
It's kind of hard.
Tom will be here in fifteen minutes.
Tom poured more wine into his glass.
I've already tried that.
It's not a fair fight.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Where did you get that shirt?
I'll wait in the car.
Where did you put your key?
How much does that cost?
I am an optimist by nature.
I'm hitting the road.
The castle might be haunted.
Did you enjoy reading that book?
I can't change that.
You can go there.
I go to bed at ten every day.
Tom took a taxi to the hospital.
I have a new job.
I'll foot the bill.
We live in Boston.
We don't even know what we're fighting for.
Write me if you need help.
The whole crew was saved.
Do this work by tomorrow if at all possible.
Everyone is in the living room watching TV.
You're not that interesting.
Movie making is an exciting job.
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.
I was being sarcastic.
There appears to have been a mistake.
Tom read the letter slowly.
I bought a pen like yours yesterday.
We're studying Chinese.
I want you to get some rest.
It's not easy for me to travel alone in Japan.
Do you think it's possible?
Sooner or later, the hostages will be released.
He wasn't earning a large salary when he retired.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
I have everything under control.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
Be watchful.
Now I am too old to walk.
I use Firefox.
He will be coming to the party, too.
You should brush your teeth after every meal.
I admire your work ethic.
What evidence do you have?
I don't really want to learn French.
Kissing a person who smokes is like licking an ashtray.
You're cantankerous.
You have too many irons in the fire.
Don't tell anyone.
I figured you might need some help.
I'd be careful with that if I were you.
The trip was canceled because of a terrible storm.
Can't you just leave me alone?
I'm going to hide somewhere near here.
I don't like being treated like this.
I need someone who I can talk to.
That's what I was trying to do.
I'm delighted to meet you.
You must answer these questions.
That's not important now.
The State of Texas is almost the same size as France.
I'm not writing about you.
Be respectful.
Can a child of her age distinguish good from bad?
Be polite to your parents.
You don't have to explain.
That girl has a lovely doll.
You should call your parents more often.
They sat under a tree.
Make me a better offer.
The movie is now showing at a theater near you.
Some people like cats, others prefer dogs.
These books are mine.
She warmed herself by the fire.
Afterwards, he assumed a new identity.
The situation was very unusual.
There are no secrets between us.
Tom had an appointment.
I'll do the best I can.
I'd like your permission to use it.
I really don't have anything else to say.
I'm not afraid to fight.
The rebels took control of the capital.
I thought you said you couldn't eat raw fish.
Tom put on some clothes.
Are you going, too?
This is exactly what I needed.
You don't know anything.
It is morning. The children are eating breakfast.
I've been working all day.
Do you mind if I watch TV for a while?
I thought it was funny.
That's why I worry about you.
I'm sorry I shot you.
I have a bath every day.
I want to hear all about it.
He can drive a car.
I want to take the test now.
I don't want Mary to leave me.
I didn't want to tell you that on the phone.
I didn't see you until now.
To tell you the truth, I don't love him.
I'm sorry that you didn't sleep well.
I forgot I was supposed to bring a bottle of wine.
The policeman shot into the air.
I don't have any money.
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor.
Can you identify them?
Tom is leaving next year.
Tom lost his wallet.
Do you use all this stuff?
As soon as she opened the door, a cat ran out.
Tom says that he's seen a ghost.
Now drink up.
I don't think Tom would try to do that without our help.
Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white passenger.
Who did you talk to?
She seems to be unhappy.
Tom isn't available at the moment.
Would you hold this for me, please?
Tom should've protected Mary.
What do you like to eat?
Thanks for your help.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Tom is heavily armed.
I live in Yokohama.
She persuaded him to do it even though she knew it wasn't a good idea.
She is collecting material for a book.
I just thought you were happy.
How much time did we lose?
We heard screams.
Calm down. I'll come over as soon as possible.
I asked a policeman for directions.
We have to find out what's going on here.
I don't need Tom.
I want you to return the book I lent you the other day.
It kept raining for three days.
Are they friends?
It's a lot different now.
We went to the park to take pictures.
Is that so?
Everything is closed.
Was it difficult to make?
What are you saving up for?
I realize I'm just stating the obvious.
Mary is very beautiful.
I'd rather stay than go.
The door opened and a man came out.
She asked him to marry her.
You're awfully quiet this morning.
I should be there.
I never get to see you anymore.
I know this is hard.
You can't just not do your job.
Nobody but a fool would believe it.
This is by far the tallest building in this city.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
The soldiers could see him now.
Don't let the kid play with knives.
Winter is coming soon.
These batteries are all dead.
I've told you that a hundred times.
You can see from his chin that takes after his father.
My car is at your disposal.
You're opportunistic.
I am 19 years old.
Tom helped us push the car.
I never drink alone.
The rain prevented me from coming.
I don't want to watch television.

There was a ton of pressure on him.
Food must be chewed well to be digested properly.
You're three hours late.
Tom has decided to become a pilot.
She still loves him.
You cannot achieve the impossible without attempting the absurd.
Why did they hire you?
I have a wife.
You look amazing.
I should've advised Tom to not talk to Mary anymore.
I'd help you if I could.
Have you read this book?
The important point to note is that both parties offered similar solutions to this problem.
Nothing's going to happen.
Maybe it's not that bad.
You cook better than I do.
Excuse me for being late.
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour.
Hey, don't be so selfish, Tom.
What's the golden rule?
Give Tom everything you have.
London, the capital of England, is on the Thames.
Put them on the table.
Tom let go of Mary's hand.
I have been expecting you.
The wind blew all day.
I was shocked by the price.
I'm not one of your soldiers.
Would you give me a discount?
I put my hand on his shoulder.
My father is proud of being tall and handsome.
I was new.
Dogs are faithful.
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
It was kind of you to help me.
Will you excuse us for one moment?
I want you to talk.
You sound like your mother.
Please refrain from smoking here.
There's no one here.
If you can digest them, raw vegetables are good for your health.
I am sure of her success.
They will be safe with him.
He came in through the window.
Tom seems to want to help Mary.
I didn't know Tom was sleeping.
I don't know why you're all so angry.
I ate something that didn't agree with me.
How can you know that?
Do you want me to lose my job?
Her new husband turned out to be a bad person.
I want to write to Tom.
I don't feel much like laughing.
You said you'd do anything for me.
We might need to help Tom.
She bought her son a camera.
I am happy to have so many good friends.
That might not be so bad.
I'm still not sure I can do that.
Do you like apples?
Our lives are in your hands.
It's still too early to tell.
I'm not going to wait.
We have to go.
Have you ordered?
The sooner we get there, the more likely are we to get seats.
I know that's my ticket.
We probably won't have much snow this winter.
None of us is perfect.
Tom leaned back against the wall.
Do you think this rope is strong enough?
Do you know how to ride a horse?
Manholes are round because that way they won't accidentally fall through the hole.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
I'm not comfortable doing this.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
What do you think of my idea?
You have to go alone.
I want to say I'm sorry.
I'm completely wrecked.
I don't have those answers.
Did I give you enough time?
I feel terrible about ruining your party.
My feet are small compared to yours.
We all deserve respect.
That will please my father.
Tom heard some shots.
What don't you have?
We've got a lot of friends.
Had he known what was about to happen, he would have changed his plan.
I'm off to the gym.
Can I get your attention, please?
Go inside.
I don't think it's good for him to go alone.
This room has space for fifty people.
Are you still sleepy?
I mean it!
I've got something for you.
You might want to try working out a bit.
I miss her a lot.
We lost our electricity because of the storm.
Would you like more mashed potatoes?
What exactly are you looking for?
Do your homework by yourself.
You're fortunate.
I know Tom was shaken.
A password is required.
You must meet with her.
You shouldn't break promises.
I hope to see you again.
I had a stroke.
I knew you weren't really dead.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
I got to Boston yesterday afternoon.
She is quick at everything.
I'm sure I turned off the gas.
I know how hard that is.
I'm going to be your teacher.
We're not doing anything wrong.
Tom has an older sister named Mary.
Tom came here to help me.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Be sure not to eat too much.
That soil is rich in humus.
Tom changed his diet.
I bet you're feeling really good right now.
The boy almost drowned.
They're mad at you.
I love my mother very much.
Help me for just a minute.

We'll talk about this later.
He admitted his defeat.
It is Saturday.
I would like to have a cup of coffee.
The clock is made in Switzerland.
Some of them were wounded.
All of us are disappointed.
I wish we'd met earlier.
Tom didn't know he was supposed to do that today.
I thought you were asleep.
Can I see you at ten tomorrow?
Bring me the dictionary.
Have you thought about what we talked about the other night?
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
Don't dodge the question.
He went to America for the purpose of studying American literature.
I thought you were having a good time.
How long does it take by car?
That's not unusual.
We must be cautious.
Tom doesn't agree with you.
Tom's new wife's name is Mary.
This intersection is dangerous.
I'll stay involved.
Did you hear the news?
Tom eats lunch at the school cafeteria two or three times a week.
I'm a priest.
Tom had to spend a night in jail.
I haven't gotten any letters from Tom yet.
You're really annoying.
I'm sleepy, so I am leaving now.
I'm aware of the facts.
Don't lose your sense of humor.
I am tired.
Learning a foreign language is fun.
Nobody's going to hire you.
Do you guys want to come, too?
Do you still believe I killed my brother?
The administration makes important decisions.
Water is a liquid.
I need a concise explanation.
Even if you are busy, you should keep your promise.
I still have mine.
I overslept again.
If you're not out of the shower in five minutes, I'm cutting the hot water!
London is on the Thames.
I can't help you because I am busy.
One hundred and fifty people entered the marathon race.
The sooner you leave, the better.
What do these markings mean?
He's not worthy of you.
We have only two dollars.
Tom doesn't make enough money to support his family.
I agree with him.
A beer, please.
How often should I feed my dog?
I thought you were bluffing.
Could you please do that for me?
I'm expecting a customer today.
Let's wait here.
What's the best way to learn French?
Are you waiting for someone?
Tom is on the bus with Mary.
I've got a pair of sunglasses.
It's crowded again today.
What do you remember?
He wishes to erase bad memories.
Please be polite.
How's everybody at home?
I'm getting sleepy again.
I thought it was a good idea.
It would be too easy.
The handyman was supposed to arrive at twelve noon, but got stuck in a traffic jam for a few hours.
That's an unusual request.
I'll take some X-rays of your teeth.
You're picky, aren't you?
We slept in the same bed.
He is mad about music.
I'm sure you're very busy.
We understand this.
I'm coming to pick you up.
I'm not your son.
It was just a fling.
He graduated from some rinky-dink college in Oklahoma.
He isn't here now.
Do you mean to go?
She likes to go to the library.
The students disobeyed their teacher.
It's a fruit.
Are you responsible for this mess?
Either way's fine with me.
I just couldn't say no.
The cat is adorable.
He's a good boy.
He looks old for his age.
You're totally ignorant.
I've never seen you like this.
They treated us like family.
Tom pressed his ear against the wall.
Sure, it might be traumatic, but so what?
He comes every day to visit his sick friend.
Let's do this before it gets hot.
I said that I would be twenty next birthday.
Forget your sorrows.
I can't afford to pay so much.
I'll go.
I woke up with a headache this morning.
He is a true gentleman.
The dog stopped barking.
I saw a house with a red roof.
Come back home.
I didn't ask you to come here.
They are very kind.
Can you believe it? He's even lazier than me.
Tom is a professional singer.
You have to give me more time.
The word "theory" is often misused.
I think I know who painted that picture.
I wish there were a better translation of this book.
She decided to go.
I don't like to clean.
The reason is pretty obvious.
Hey, be careful with that!
I outrank you.
I just want life to be like it was before.
That child has few friends.
All the money spent, we started looking for work.
You've got a one-track mind.
You'll catch a cold.
I'll always remember your kindness.
Tom hung up his coat.
I really need to talk to you privately.
I still want to go.
Tom was a school bus driver before he became a taxi driver.
I think you ought to postpone the meeting.
It took us two hours to get to Tokyo.
Tom should know that.
We all know what happened here.
I, too, have a question.
That was harder than I thought it would be.
It's easy to remember.
I know your type.
I'll be late.
There is little hope that they are alive.
Don't fall off!
I want to learn that song.
Tom was on his way to church.
She decided to be a doctor.
You can't handle it.
Close the door, please.
Can you imagine what our lives would be like without electricity?
They huddled together.
Can I turn on the radio?
I can't wait to meet you.
I'll take one.
Tom is all right.
Is there another way to get there?
I have a very old stamp.
Are we still on for tomorrow night?
That song reminds me of my home.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
He ate it in no time.
We reached the station on time.
He was sentenced to prison.
She took down a book from the shelf.
Would you like to play tennis on Sunday?
I went to the hospital to have my eyes tested.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
I waited for her for a really long time.
What'll you give me for this?
He's in prison.
It's considered to be an important matter.
Get a hold of yourself.
Nice timing.
What is that over there?
I wonder whether Tom will tell Mary the truth.
What is all this stuff?
You can't do two things at once.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
Don't play baseball here.
This is a doghouse that I made myself.
I'd like a word with you in private.
No one cared.
They are on good terms with each other.
Are you watching your weight?
I really appreciate you helping me.
I hope the bus will come before long.
I like that one.
That would be a waste of their talents.
I want those back when you're done.
Don't get angry. It won't help you.
Everybody likes money.
The odds are in his favor.
She was pleased with the new dress.
You're always singing.
You're not a teenager yet.
He translated the book from French into English.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
I started it.
Please bear in mind what I said.
Just do what you've got to do.

Now look what you've done.
I feel like being alone.
Tom told me he didn't take French in high school.
If you hit a patch of fog, slow down and put your blinkers on.

How often do you shower?
What were you afraid of?
These walls aren't exactly soundproof.
The baby kept crying all night.
The soup is too salty.
Please leave a message.
Far from being pleased, my father is very angry.
It's ached before, but never as badly as right now.
I have not finished breakfast yet.
Doctors should keep abreast with all the latest developments in medicine.
English is not my mother tongue.
Are they busy?
Our concert has been postponed.
This water is a little salty.
We've all been here before.
You don't know what Tom is capable of.
I got together with her mainly because we seemed to share the same feelings about things.
Tom could sell anything.
Put the desk against the wall.
Tom is out of breath.
Tom couldn't get his shoes off.
Due to the bad weather, the game was called off.
Stop or I'll shoot.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It was just a coincidence.
They are very big.
The only reason Tom went to the party was that he expected Mary to be there.
I was so excited that I couldn't fall asleep.
What do you think of this hat?
She tied him to the chair.
He's worried about the result.
How do you know who I am?
He's an aristocrat.
Have you been up all night?
It was extremely funny.
Be proud of yourself.
Tom was the first person to arrive.
I am forbidden to stay out after 10 o'clock.
My hubby and I used to go mountain climbing together.
Tom and Mary adopted a handicapped child.
She surprised him with a small gift.
I saw you.
I made that decision on my own.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
Tom is out in the yard, playing with our dog.
The rule holds good in this case.
They live in a rented house.
I don't want to do this here.
You seem to have thought of something else.
I just did what the boss asked me to do.
Who's going to pay for this?
I studied French in school, but I'm not very good at it.
Since you're tired, you should rest.
Do you know me?
I come every day.
I hate guys like that.
Try not to panic.
Don't forget to vote.
He is very particular about his food.
Tom was lucky to find his keys.
I made a pot roast.
How can this be done?
I know Tom is a locksmith.
I don't live around here.
I'm very happy now.
Tom seemed a bit surprised.
We received their wedding announcement.
You don't seem too surprised.
Tom's death was an accident.
During hard times, people might not go on a trip, but they might be willing to pay extra for good coffee.

She gave me a meaningful look.
Is it time you need?
Whatever doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
This job doesn't pay.
The president is a down-to-earth kind of man.
May I take your coat?
You must work together.
He ran up the stairs.
Do you know the way?
I really don't envy you.
They caught a lion alive.
How can you not like him?
I will make you happy.
I've been waiting for you for three hours!
You disgust me.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I can't stop Tom.
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
I finished my lunch quickly.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
I'm glad you're all right.
I thought you were in charge.
The dog came running to me.
All of you speak French, right?
Tom yawned.
I didn't want you to leave me.
Morality is mostly a matter of how much temptation you can withstand.
When did the robbery happen?
Tom is making a mistake.
I apologize to all of you.
He gave me his phone number.
A contract with that company is worth next to nothing.
The problem is that you're not Canadians.
She led a solitary life.
You have to make the crease very straight.
I think we're ready to go.
You aren't going to tell my parents, are you?
He whispered something to her.
I'm not used to sleeping in a tent.
It was the bad weather that caused his illness.
I thought we could use the cloth napkins.
He passed his property on to his son.
I really am busy.
I don't think that's what I need.
Why do you like sports so much?
The word "nigger" is an offensive term.
That is almost correct.
Did your wish come true?
I think someone stole all these things and planted them to make me look guilty.
We must stick together.
Tom was scared to death.
She went to Italy for the purpose of studying music.
Who forced you to do that?

The report is incorrect.
Is that what Tom told you?
I'm only joking.
Tom said he thought Mary was sleepy.

They're dying.
Tom hasn't changed at all.

If you bite me, I'll bite back.
The bus was very crowded.
Tom wants to start from scratch.
How do I thank you?
You seem a little depressed.
What does this hat remind you of?
My pen isn't as good as yours.
I won't let you go there.
Please tell Tom I'm sorry.
Are you retarded or something?
I'm sending you a book.
He is in his early thirties.
We could understand each other.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
You should ask your parents for permission.
Have you gone over the lesson?
I'm sneaky.
You look a little green around the gills.
Tom was obviously offended.
I want to share this with you.
Do you mind if I turn down the TV?
A yard is equal to three feet.
Tell her that I love her.
She failed every time she tried.

Can you explain your answer?
I was a teacher for fifteen years.
I want to know what's funny.
I can't find my wallet.
I forgot to do something.

Will you help me with my English homework?

I want to get married.
May I open a can?
I want you out of my life.
I got lost in the forest.
I would prefer to speak to you in private.
So what're you saying?
I've decided never to vote again.
She baked me a cake.
Her skin is as white as snow.
I am from France.
I want to find out where it came from.
Did Tom say what he wanted?
I apologize in advance.
I must see you.
I had to face this alone.
Hurry up, or you will miss the last train.
Maybe we shouldn't do that.

When did you see him?
Can you say that again?
What I told you about him also holds true for his brother.

She calls him every night.
Hey, how do you get this thing open?
Quickly buy all required items.

The bridge saved them a lot of time and trouble.
I will follow your advice.
The chicken was great.

My son is ashamed of his behavior.
I want it to be a success.
I like playing the piano.
They were watching television.
Who will you be coming with?
It was kind of weird.
Tom wasn't very impressed.
He has just left home.
You're all invited.
I've got you.
I'm not busy anymore.
Because of the pills I took, the pain went away.
I feel ashamed.
I never stop thinking about you.
You can't help them.
I repeated what he said exactly as he had said it.
You don't seem tired at all.
I wish I had the will power to stay on a diet.
You're very rude.
He calculated the speed of light.
What are you saying?
Don't take our word for it.
I'm going to use it tomorrow.

He tricked me.
Roses smell good.
I live with my family.
He learned the news while reading the newspaper.
I put my hat on.

Some superstitious people in America believe that if a black cat crosses your path, you'll have bad luck.
Are you on dope?
I wonder why women outlive men.
Are you still in love?
I wonder what Tom is thinking.
If it rains, the excursion will be called off.
I'd rather stay home than go out in this weather.
I don't want Tom to see that.
You got here late, didn't you?
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'd like to try it on.
You were just doing your duty.
Can I tell you something very personal?
I'll have to confiscate your knife.
What a waste of energy!
Did you just hit Tom?
Many children stay after school for club activities.

I've seen this picture before.
I went into the army.
He is responsible for the accident.

She still has a little money, but not much.
They were tired of waiting.
What's in your hand?
It's simple and intuitive.
The view is amazing.
What was the cause of the accident?
I appreciate your vigilance.
It almost worked.
Pass me the wine.
She is not always happy.
Have we met before?
She persuaded him to marry her.

He was destined to become a great musician.
The server was down.
Can somebody get that?
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
I'm willing to accept your offer.
Tom isn't overweight.
How long have you been a teacher?
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
All the prisoners escaped.
Tom said that he didn't enjoy his job.
She poured water into the basin.
Do your best.
Men should work.
This is old news.
Do you know something I don't know?
I have nothing to say with regard to that problem.
Do you need our help?
I couldn't do anything about it.
Tom clearly doesn't want to be there.
Why can't you come?

After the Christmas party was over, we all went out caroling.
Do you still want to give me a hug?
Just give me the gun.
Where are my hat and my gloves?
I was embarrassed when he talked to me.
You know it's a lie.
Tom walked across the room and opened the window.
If you travel by Shinkansen, it doesn't seem far from Nagoya to Tokyo.
No one seems to care.
I hope Tom knows what he's doing.

I prefer to study in the afternoon.
Things break.
After the storm, it was calm.

She was satisfied with the new dress.
Please keep it a secret.
Grab your gear.
He is not very strict about it.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Would you mind if I smoked?
I'm very interested in learning French.
Which book is better?
Show me how it works.
Let's make a big circle.
I doubt if he is a lawyer.
I just said I didn't want to talk about it.
Why have the apes evolved more than other animals?
It doesn't fit well here.
We went to London last year.
I love Chinese food.
It's popular with students.
I pointed my camera at her.
Be reasonable.
Ignore Tom's request.
Parents should monitor their children's whereabouts.
I can't help you now.
Tom is right-handed.
I don't like coffee.
You're famous.
They didn't want me to examine it.
I speak French and English.
He collected various information.
I thought a walk in the park might take our minds off our troubles.
There's no turning back now.
What exactly happened?
They're brother and sister.
We need to clarify a few details.
I may as well go now.
I found the man I want to marry.
Tom seems to be objective.
What steps should we take?
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other.
I'll take care of those.
You are abusing your authority.
I want to know the truth.
It is true in a sense.
Well, tell me what you know.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
I have a prior engagement.
You can't go yet.
But I don't think it's at all odd.
I'm already a father.
I thought you were kidding.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
He hesitated before answering.
If I don't do that now, I'll never do it.
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't speak French.
Both dogs are asleep.
You're quite safe.
I thought everybody liked it.
He was exiled from his country.
I worked with Tom.
I wasn't gossiping.
When she heard the bad news, she fainted.
She smells bad.
They're cleaning the beach.
I don't understand you. I have an earache.
Does the story have a happy ending?
Tom really likes Chopin.
Are we prepared?
She's my older sister.
Her hair was so long that it reached the floor.
Does that surprise you?
I don't know all the details myself.
Don't send me home, please.
They have come.
I don't care what you thought.
No one can stop me.
My computer's acting strange.
What's all the commotion about anyway?
Can we recycle this?
I have the key.
I don't work well under pressure.
I fell off the ladder.
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
There were hundreds of cars on the street.
He drank himself to death.
I like both dogs and cats.
You were very busy, weren't you?
Do you know where to go or who to ask for information?
I don't want you to be upset.
The building that I saw was very large.
He will have to go to the station.
I like his new house, but I had not expected it to be so small.
Thank you for stopping by.
He wants the most bang for his buck.
He is over the hill, you know.
I believe all that.
Are you ready to go?
Why does catnip make cats loopy?
They're self sufficient.
The island was now surrounded by militia.
Tom is now back in prison.
I dislike being alone.
You don't sound convinced.
Do you get much snow in the winter?
I am very tired from the hard work.
We have to talk about this.
I apologize for that.
I didn't save the file.
I wonder whose these scissors are.
I was more than a little disappointed.
All the rooms are taken.
The computer repair took all day.
How much is this tour per person?
How much longer will the thunderstorm last?
Now's not the time.
Tom is still confident.
It's getting late.
They're all against me.
A ring and some cash are missing.
Tom has a point here.
Why is everyone looking at me?
I knew that Tom was a bum.
No kidding?
Please don't be sad any more.
That was amazing.
Who knows what he'll accomplish if given the chance?
I've come to apologize.
Are you sure this is what you want?
I'm not shy.
Can we talk?
Tom has decided to have the surgery that his doctor recommended.
We want out of here.
They each received a present.
I didn't recognize it at first.
I must get my work done by the day after tomorrow.
I have my own bedroom.
Why did they do that?
That's clearly not true.
I didn't know that Tom had already bought milk.
The U.S. gun ownership rate is the highest in the world.
It makes me feel dirty.
He drives me crazy.
He betrayed you.
We can talk in front of Tom.
Tom can't tell Mary his real feelings.
OK, I think I get it.
My mom works in a factory.
She moved out of her parents' house.
How much time do we have?
Here's the tricky part.
My cat eats like a horse.
You're confused.
Let's schedule a meeting for next Monday.
I fed the horses.
Did you enjoy the show?
Tom is hiding something from me, too.
Where exactly did you go?
I think I'll go to Boston next weekend.
Tom seems very opinionated.
We like it.
He's going to regret this.
I didn't think anyone was home.
Is that it?
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
Many people think that children don't spend enough time playing outside.
Can we just drop it?
The woman is reading.
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
Where's your grandfather?
Another bottle of wine, please.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I'm not saying this is your fault.
Keep the child away from the pond.
She wanted to return home, but she got lost.
You're not allowed to go into that room.
It seems to me that I heard a noise in the attic.
You were hot, weren't you?
My taxi should be here soon.
I don't know your brother.
One of the aircraft's engines cut out.
I couldn't stop laughing.
Be careful with that thing.
I finished all my work early.
I don't care if you go or not. I'm going anyway.
Can you help me wash these dishes?
Why can't you do it?
Let's keep an eye on this.
Diplomatic relations have not yet been established between Japan and North Korea.
There's someone waiting for me outside.
He passed the entrance examination.
I haven't eaten since breakfast and I'm very hungry.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Have you ever been a soldier?
Don't make fun of others.
You're the last hope for humanity.
I'd like to know who took those pictures.
He will come back.
Come on, spit it out!
Where's my phone?
White carpets are very hard to keep clean.
Am I in trouble financially?
You're with friends.
She was swimming.
He can come.
May I borrow your eraser?
I told you to call me.
Don't ever do that again.
I'd like to come with you.
He instantly fell in love with her.
You're asking me to do something I don't want to do.
Don't touch the stove.
Are you sure?
I dare you to prove me wrong.
They probably saw our ship come into port.
I caught an awful cold.
He is a handsome young man.
I was very disappointed.
That's the problem with doing things your way.
What does USB stand for?
This custom dates from ancient times.
I don't care how long the list is.
She's good at tennis.
The United States has almost a fourth of the world's prison population.

I found a real bargain.
Who's in command here?
Can you still remember where we first met?
There's a rumor going around that you two are dating.
I want to workout.
We need to invest in clean, renewable energy.
I won't tolerate that.

She got a present from her boyfriend.
Click here to create an account.

My father banks part of his salary every week.
You could've killed somebody.
We found that we had lost our way.
Where have you been up to now?
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
How do I know this isn't another one of your tricks?
Did you have a rough day?
It's no use for him to try to find out the real reason.
I'm not following you.
He got hurt in the game yesterday.
You can't tell anyone about this.
You don't have to say anything you don't want to say.
I think you are the one who broke it.
I hurried so I wouldn't miss the train.
Even though I can speak Chinese, I can't read it.
I only went inside once.
I'm afraid I'll be a burden to you.
How tall you are!
Be sure to look over your paper again before you hand it in.
Take one of these.
We both want it.
You're very astute.
I would give anything to win her back.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
You're not allowed in there.
Tom asked an awkward question.
You'll find yourself in a miserable situation.
She spent all afternoon cooking.
I gather you were unsuccessful.
The plane flew over the mountain.
A heavy rain prevented me from going.
He left his son a large fortune.
They huddled together.
You are twice as strong as me.
I didn't want to spend any more time in bed.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
Have you finished your meal?
I've never used a hacksaw before. Could you show me how?
The Union soldiers fought fiercely.
The knife is not sharp.
Here's the tricky part.
He didn't answer the phone, so I sent him an email.
I can't keep this.
Tom loved it.
You could help me.
Do you remember how we met?
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
Nothing is more pleasant than taking a rest after hard work.
You must not discuss this with anyone.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
We knew enough.
Australia is one of the countries I want to visit before I die.
That was unexpected.
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
I know Tom is finished.
Who are you talking about?
There is one thing I don't understand.
Tom told me why he wasn't able to do that.
Let's be best friends forever.
Can you tell us what happened to you?
She lives with him in a small apartment.
I hope you all understand.
There is a subtle difference between the two words.
Tom thinks that he's stronger than I am.
My father is busy as a bee every day.
We all change.
Girls think about boys a lot.
I want you to wear this one.
This doesn't fit.
She suggested that I give it to him right away.
She is always complaining about something or other.
Are you excited?
Tom asked the teacher several questions.
Get this stuff out of here.
Tom peeled the apple.
You have to go the rest of the way without me.
They were all good swimmers.
Who's hiding behind the curtain?

Why did you come early?
We're kidding.
Close your eyes for three minutes.
I don't think you did this by yourself.
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker.
I suppose you think I'm nuts.
I didn't think that you could do that.
I can't live without him.
I don't understand what's happening.
You need a drink.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Do you have one?
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
Don't be so pessimistic.
I'm not yet accustomed to this cold weather.
It's not actually raining yet.
He did not mention it.
I am exhausted.
That's unfair.
Are you bachelors?
Can someone give me a lift?
Let's go sit in the shade.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus had already left.
Did you make this doll by yourself?
You remind me of somebody.
I love cookies.
I still have to try.
There's a catch.
How nice!
When did your father come home?
I thought I was going crazy.
I brought you some coffee.
The food was wonderful.
Both of them started crying.
Leave me alone now.
I'm not the least bit worried about losing my job.
I'm no longer angry at you.
This is a beautiful painting.
You can't attend? Why not?
Are you going to go out with Tom again?
We'll work tomorrow.
Tom scared the children.
Be kind to old people.
Can you beat that?
Do you agree with what he says in the book?
I am going to leave my present job.
Are you sure that you know what to do?
The baby is crying.
Why was I turned down for the job?

I'm a little disappointed.
It is no good to you.
They begged us to help them.
She asked him to read it for her because she had lost her glasses.
We're looking for a volunteer.
There was a mad rush toward the exit.
She lived with him all her life.
I want to do this on my own.
Which class are you in?
You're my best customer.
Tom refused to keep working.
Mary's husband must miss her.
I want to get there early so we can get good seats.
Hurry up, or you will be late.
There's nothing more annoying than a group of young girls all trying to talk at the same time.
When did you have time to do all this?
It's obsolete.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
How far is it from here to the hotel?
The doors are shut.
We have a lot more work to do.
I've been trying to call you all night.
Is there something you're not telling us?
I sacrificed everything.
It seems we are in the same boat.
My grandmother lived with us.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
Popularity has nothing to do with it.
The statue was damaged.
It never occurred to me that what I was doing might be illegal.
Everything's going to be fine.
Don't talk during class.
Mary was looking for you at that time.
He took the public by surprise.
That's odd.
Something is wrong.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
You were right about this.
I'm your boss.
My car broke down this morning and won't be repaired until Friday.
That's how I feel now.

I am in the habit of going for a walk before breakfast.
We were all present at her wedding.
He did a rough drawing to show me the way to the station.
They met in high school.
Anybody see you?
You should try it on.
What if something went wrong?
I will go with you if necessary.
I want to talk to you about this list.
I usually don't bother with people like him.
You can count on him.
I'm tired of doing this.
Several children are playing on the sandy beach.
Are you productive?
I will never forgive you.
I'm ready for the fight.
The cat seems extremely happy.
It's nothing to write home about.
I think we're looking for different things.
Do you think you could help me?
That's not exactly what I meant.
He left for America the day before yesterday.
Tom was surprised to see me.
I thought about what you said yesterday.
I want to work with you.
I have to write a letter.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Help Tom.
Let's eat before we go.
The road turns left there.
Don't brake suddenly.
You look good in black.
I got sunburned.
How can you be so optimistic?
You're so impatient.
My hobby is collecting old bottles.
How long did you stay in Boston?
We'll all die sooner or later.
War is hell.
Can you beat that?
Leave me alone.
I don't gossip.
He told me that he would leave before long.
It is pretty cold.
Tom told Mary he had to leave early.
I convinced everyone.
A compromise was reached.
Did you say 30?
I have absolute confidence in your judgement.
You're always disagreeing with your boss.
Don't be fresh with me.
I wonder what's in the box.
Crime is on the increase.
I don't own a suit.
I don't want to hear another complaint about you.
Now that you are an adult, you should know better.
Did Tom swim?
I see you are ready.
We can't be the only two people who forgot to pay our bills on time.
I often buy bread from the bakery next to the post office.
Our teacher often overlooked his name on the list.
She has a picture.
That never happened.
Stay a moment.
Would you like to go to a movie tonight?
No one trusts him any more.
Shut up and listen!
All of us stared at her.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sick.
I'm not at all tired.
You're such an idiot!
Few people live on the island.
I am fed up with this wet weather.
They teased the new student.
We hardly ever talk to each other anymore.
I can play tennis, but not very well.
My cough is getting worse.
That child wants a friend to play with.
She is exceedingly sensitive to the cold.
I know every inch of the town.
I want that more than anything.
I can't put up with him.
Most car accidents occur due to the inattention of the driver.
We rested for a while.
We're sorry.
They say that a large dam will be built.
He seemed surprised at the news.
Tom is better at science than anyone else in his class.
Have you already spent the money Tom gave you?
Your O's look like A's.
I thought we already did that.
I can't detect any pattern.
My sister still lives with our parents.
His wife goes with him wherever he goes.
A crowd soon gathered around him.
My mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella.
Let's forget about what happened last night.
I don't like your suggestion.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
I got dizzy.
I don't understand why you want it.
My aunt gave me a book for Christmas.
Did you have fun last night?
I'm being held hostage.
I'm glad you realize that.
Three-fourths of the earth's surface is covered with water.
That cloud looks like a rabbit to me.
This is the best method.
I wasn't planning on doing that.
I'm so proud of you.
I think it's time for me to do my homework.
That was a pretty stupid thing to do.
We often associate black with death.
I can hardly hear you.
Do you plan to buy that car?
If I had worked hard in my youth, I would be successful now.
I'm not rich enough to buy that.
Can I talk to you in private for a second?
That's no longer allowed.
Are we done here?
Would you mind shutting the door?
What's wrong with you?
It's your duty to finish the job.
Tom wants to open his own restaurant.
That was nice.
I know that you don't like me.
Frankly speaking, your way of thinking is out of date.
They don't need me anymore.
I work in a pharmacy.
I discussed it with my father and decided to change my job.
Tom can't paint.
You don't seem so smart.
Doing that would be a very bad idea.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
I feel like such a fool.
We can wait.
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
Your question is hard to answer.
I've come to speak with you.
There is nothing I can do to change that.
I perspire a lot at night.
I wish I could've stayed longer.
This is not for me.
They acted on the information.
If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry.
No matter how he tried, he could not open the door.
Should I help Tom with his homework?
The space race was an exciting time in history.
You were always very kind.
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
I think we can help each other.
My baby has a hereditary disease.
Be creative.
I'll keep your secret.
It wasn't very fun.
I don't like men like him.
He's a construction worker.
I feel sick whenever I see blood.
I was attacked and robbed on my way home.
You didn't tell me everything.
Tom looks awesome.
Are you doing anything special this evening?
I think I can do that.
We thank you for your cooperation.
They're coming for me.
They left the movie early.
I'll give it back.
Do you have something else in mind?
Have you ever been mugged?
I think you're ready.
I just can't get used to this.
This dog is mine.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
It's good to be home.
No one would talk about it.
Where were you three years ago?
Nobody had anything else to say.
He is anxious to read the book.
I'm talking about my friend.
It's not like you think.
I haven't been feeling so great.
Please close the door quietly.
I don't have cancer.
You're so picky.
I can't believe I didn't think of that earlier.
I didn't want to surprise you.
If you don't have this key, you won't be able to get in.
Are you still interested?
My mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old.
I don't sound like that.
I couldn't let you do that.
A common way to finance a budget deficit is to issue bonds.
What are we afraid of?
Please sit down.
We set up our tents before dark.
There's no telling what he'll do next.
What makes you happy?
I'll help you do that.
You don't have to be a genius to know who said that.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
I really couldn't have done this without you.
OK, I think I get it.
I don't even want you there.
I canceled my hotel reservations and stayed with friends.
I tried explaining the algebra homework to him, but it just went in one ear and out the other.
I figured you could use some help.
I'll forgive you.
Let's go by bus.
What is it with you people?
You can't go out there.
I feel quite at ease among strangers.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
I'll take care of you.
You have bought more postage stamps than are necessary.
His courage won him fame.
She put me in a delicate situation.
I felt a little dizzy.
How can I change your mind?
Tom always yells at Mary every time she does something stupid.
I told you to leave.
I'm not dating Tom.
He kept talking.
They found the room empty.
We need a car.
I urge caution.
Is the horse black?
Don't trust anyone.
Sometimes I can't really grasp the meaning of a word.
I don't care who your father is. You still have to follow my orders.
She appears to have a lot of friends.
They told me Tom was dead.
Tom will thank me for this one of these days.
He sold his business and retired.
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
What's that strange smell coming from the kitchen?
How tall is your youngest brother?
Tom is a crook.
We should probably tell Tom.
Tom forgot about the meeting.
Can you tell the difference between an American and a Canadian?
The mountain has a beautiful shape.
We all want the same thing.
Did you learn to speak French when you were a child?
I made it on time.
I'll paint the house.
Tom drank too much wine.
I wrote a memo.
I'm broke.
They were tired of waiting.
He was crossing the street.
He was beside himself with joy.
The sound of a gunshot echoed across the canyon.
Tell him to wait.
Who won?
Smoking is a bad habit.
He made use of the opportunity to improve his English.
I abhor violence.
Tom is fairly ambitious, isn't he?
I am not ready yet.
Tom bet on the wrong horse.
A dollar is equal to a hundred cents.
We looked for her.
She works for a hospital.
Those colors go well together.
I come in peace.
She was advised by him on how to stay healthy.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
Do you want something?
I saw everything.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
I'm not busy anymore.
I am looking at that.
We're ambitious.
By the way, how many of you are keeping a diary?
Fill the tires with air.
I must warn them.
Isn't that nice?
I have children.
I thought something was odd.
They asserted that it was true.
Tom is from a small town.
Do you think that's what I want?
I don't have the number.
This will make a big difference.
Can you get my bill ready?
Be kind to the children.
I want to deposit some money.
I can't do it without somebody's help.
He's from Georgia.
I've taken care of that.
Could I do it?
He was caught with his pants down.
I can feel it.
Cars parked illegally on this street will be impounded.
I'm creative.
Did I hurt you?
Don't I even get an explanation?
I fell when I was running.
Tom had no way of verifying the information.
I feel really bad.
I can hardly wait to get home and sleep in my own bed.
I can barely understand what he's saying.
Let him go!
I'd like to have breakfast with you.
To tell you the truth, I don't like Tom.
A lot of people aren't happy.
What time did you wake up this morning?
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
When the man saw a policeman, he fled.
It's not worth worrying about it.
Tom is not a member.
His slacks are all wrinkled.
Don't open the door till the train stops.
It was less than fifteen dollars.
Do you mind if I try this on?
Her stern look got him to quit talking.
I need help translating this document into French.
I wonder what to make for dinner.
I had this suit custom made for me.
That's all nonsense.
We've decided to remain silent.
What proof do you have that he committed this crime?
Our investigation is ongoing.
He married my cousin.
I'll be there at 2:30.
The rumor isn't true.
He's not serious.
That's what I'm trying to do.
Come on up here.
Are you still happy?
We do need your advice.
I wonder if this is really true.
I just don't want to fight with you.
We ate sandwiches for lunch.
They crushed all resistance.
I know I made a mistake.
My bicycle needs to be repaired.
Why would I know that?
Those are your options.
They didn't know.
Tom is a student at the university where I used to teach.
This tea isn't sweet enough for me.
Why are you even here?
You will exist but you will never know what it is to live.
What time are you coming?
You have lipstick on your cheek.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I want to help, but I can't.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
Leave me alone!
I'd like some shoes.
She is always fishing for compliments.
How come you know English so well?
This makes me very happy.
I didn't see the accident.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
I'm trying to make a good first impression.
I think you're wrong.
Did your uncle let you drive his car?
It is their right to vote.
I want you to be with me.
Can you wait a little while?
Tom wants to see you.
He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
She has a gift for prophecy.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
You're welcome.
He has a large truck.
I don't have to talk to you.
Tom has a friend whose mother is a veterinarian.
Would you like to have another beer?
This river is shallow enough to wade to the other side.
In a sense, it is true.
Try not to look so nervous.
Snow reminds me of my hometown.
You're such an idiot!
She returned his kiss.
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
His suggestion is worth considering.
You're not like me.
You can not miss it.
Can we get started now?
How interesting!
I think I'd rather walk.
She prodded him to work harder.
It is high time you were in bed.
He is much better than me at the high jump.
Please don't let this happen again.
She was voted prom queen.
I'd like to swim in this river.
I was very nervous.
Can rabbits swim?
That's how I lost my job.
I'm at the end of my rope.
Don't listen to her.
No one else knows this.
I went to Europe before the war.
They went to the zoo.
How old was Tom when he started talking?
Mozart died in 1791.
What are you lining up for?
We saved you a seat right here.
He came to see me yesterday afternoon.
This letter won't reach its destination.
Tom is a little unhappy here.
I know you must be afraid.
He's three years older than her.
You're scared of being hurt, aren't you?
The following morning, the snowman was completely melted.
Isn't that weird?
I stayed at home all day instead of going to work.
The French president is to visit Japan next month.
I haven't seen you around before.
What did Tom sing at your wedding?
You've got to pay attention.
Give me your belt.
Everyone who worked on that project became a millionaire.
He is never lazy.
I've dreamed of this day.
I ordered a glass of wine.
They arrived too soon.
Tell me what you want.
There was a lot of food in the house.
Tom gave me 300 dollars.
The boy's aggression is making problems.
She promised that she would meet him after school.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
Her classmates do not appreciate her.
It feels weird.
Look at the picture.
You were late yesterday.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
I've already found somebody to do that job.
Tadpoles become frogs.
I deserve happiness.
I think I'm a pretty good singer.
Are you happy with that?
I didn't even get one letter from her.
He removed his shirt.
You'll feel better now.
Can I borrow a pen? Mine's on its last legs.
Good luck to both of you.
Do you want a drink or not?
You should get your eyes checked.
How does Tom plan to help?
I whistled.
Let's finish what we started.
Don't be so shy.
When are you coming back to Boston?
He asked if I liked Chinese food.
He did nothing wrong.
We talked about many things.
You lied to me, didn't you?
Is this your house?
I want you to love me for who I am.
Why didn't you come?
Be polite to your parents.
You had better go.
You did an excellent job.
I can't believe you would allow this.
I know what they are thinking.
All you have to do is to meet her.
They are actors.
The fishermen took photos of their catch.
We're finished.
I regret nothing.
I'm starved.
Tom ran outside half-naked.
Deeds are better than words.
I thought you had all the answers.
It was just a hunch.
Who would you like to speak with?
Please don't do that anymore.
I have some appointments this afternoon.
Why do I need to study French?
He made up his mind to marry her.
We look after him.
You're nothing but a coward.
Why are you interested?
Today is October 11th.
This reminds me of you.
She hugged her parents before she left.
She's not my girlfriend. She's my sister.
What's that?
Why are you sad?
I used to do that as a kid.
You'd better hurry.
You don't sound convinced.
That's just what he needs.
Who will do it?
I stayed there for three days.
She wanted to wash the dirty clothes.
He cut the rope with his teeth.
Where's your daughter?
Why are you irritated?
Anything is possible.
We have no options but to continue.
That's not acceptable.
Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you.
We should go to sleep.
He will not go.
I glanced through the brochure.
What do you want to do tomorrow?
Is this your beer?
Are we likely to arrive in time?
See for yourself.
I planted roses in the garden.
Don't get too excited.
Tom couldn't find it.
The senator has a very demanding schedule this week.
I'm too old for Tom.
Tom refused to go.
I think that would be very helpful.
I thought you might come.
Please sign on the dotted line.
We might not have enough time to eat lunch.
I had a terrible experience.
I need air.
I took his side in the argument.
Tom is unlocking the door now.
She has her arm in a cast.
There's nothing to eat in the kitchen.
Did you do that purposely?
I hope you're well rested.
I need them.
Bad weather prevented us from leaving.
I'm a slow learner.
I didn't know the exact procedure.
I've decided to try doing that by myself.
It was a quiet night.
Give me your hand.
This place is a dump.
I went to bed very late.
I'm used to this cold weather.
This is extremely important.
You're not the only one with this problem.
The city was blanketed with snow.
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours.
I shouldn't have gone there by myself.
Would you like a newspaper or magazine?
Whose idea was that?
I'm free.
Don't tell anyone.
Tom is making a lot of money.
I fell asleep before my father came home.
Everybody loves her.
You probably eat genetically modified fruits and vegetables all the time without knowing it.
They don't take care of that dog.
There is a rock in my shoe.
I know you're not scared.
I saw a cottage in the distance.
I'd like to thank you all for coming.
She came here to see me.
I don't remember mailing the letter.
Tom started shaking.
I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
Tom tried to conceal the truth.
I must go to the station at three o'clock.
They shouted for help.
How does that make you feel?
Tom has traveled all over Europe.
I'd like to ask Tom to join our group.
Tom asked Mary's advice about the problem.
I feel so stupid.
It matters to me.
Can you tell me where the subway entrance is?
Promise me you'll be careful.
Now is your chance.
My father is in his room.
Fight like a man.
Had he heard the news, he might have been shocked.
I don't go jogging as often as I used to.
He is every inch a gentleman.
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
Who do you want to talk to?
I'm afraid I can't save you this time.
How old is your son?
It's cold in here.
We like him.
We have to change something.
I just guessed.
I don't know yet what I want to do.
We're too close.
We often went skiing in the winter.
We should just enjoy this and not worry about how much it costs.
You're talkative.
This story has a happy ending.
Why must I suffer?
It's freezing in here.
Is that all you bought?
He did not enjoy his lessons.
I'll be with you in a minute.
She is looking forward to seeing him again.
This problem is worth discussing.
Tom speaks Japanese better than the Japanese do.
You're very wise.
That automobile was going very fast.
Help me and I'll help you.
We need to hire three welders.
Is there anything else we can do for you?
I just found out last week.
This flashlight is getting dim.
Can you give me your cell number?
I don't have a ticket.
That cheese is made from goat's milk.
I couldn't help laughing when I heard that story.
My heart was in my throat.
I want to hear your opinion.
Are you in trouble?
It's yours.
You're trustworthy.
The application deadline is October 20th.
I'm punctual.
It's way too big.
What was the boy called?
I have just come here.
No DNA evidence was found.
I don't like waiting.
Mary is my fiancée.
I don't know how I did it. What's important is that I did it.
I'm at a loss about what to do with the mess.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
It's possible that they'll go to the supermarket today.
The rain was beneficial.
Let's get the others.
This is too small.
Let's find the others.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Please forward this to as many people as possible.
I really want to kiss you.
She advised him not to use too much salt, but he wouldn't listen to her.
He made up his mind to go there.
Is that your own idea?
Were you listening to the radio yesterday?
As these trees grow tall, they rob the grass of light.
I love french fries with ketchup.
I can teach you guitar.
There are many interesting people in the world.
I'm willing to help him.
Tom usually gives easy-to-understand explanations.
Tom never fully recovered.
I saw Tom's face.
It was really interesting.
How big you are!
Would you mind my using this dictionary?
Tell me what Tom said.
You look satisfied.
I'll mail this letter today.
Can you cancel?
It's already eleven o'clock. I must be leaving now.
Do you know how much a kilo of rice costs?
You never could keep a secret.
Can you tell me what this is?
He has the ability to make a good plan.
Don't let go of my hand, or you'll get lost.
Don't forget to fill the tank with gasoline.
Don't ever say her name.
Is your homework done?
She found the ring that she had lost during the journey.
I have gone astray somewhere in my calculation.
I spoke with the minister myself.
Tom won't admit that he's wrong.
None of the windows were open.
She forced him to do it.
What did Tom buy from you?
Are you scared of me?
Tom's younger daughter is married.
She demanded to see the manager.
May I bother you for a moment?
Who forced you to do that?
I like to study French.
You must be in good physical condition.
I'm sorry, but I can't answer right away.
What's the sign over the door say?
Are you bringing anyone?
In case of an emergency, what number should I call?
She does know it.
I'd like to rent your most inexpensive car for a week.
Someone sent us a gift.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
Tom looks a little uncomfortable.
I demand that he be punished.
I really want to see you.
It won't hurt.
Everyone thought we were going to lose.
Tom knew that Mary was rich.
Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you.
Is this time different?
She is constantly writing letters.
This room gets sunshine.
He left his wife.
You probably just want to be alone.
It wasn't any bigger than a soccer ball.
You don't owe anybody anything.
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
I have the same trouble as you had.
I knew I shouldn't do that.
I believe it's my duty to protect these children.
I was born in 1960.
I'm going to stay here for several days.
We left no stone unturned.
She betrayed you.
This cloth is really smooth and silky.
Do you live here?
He is always full of ideas.
Opponents say genetically engineered crops can cross-pollinate and damage other crops.
You have no choice.
Tom is Mary's third husband.
I didn't know you were expecting anyone.
This was meant as a joke.
What did you eat for dinner?
How much oil is spilled into the ocean every year?
We were all at school together.
It was my fault.
Why do you permit it?
The situation is out of control.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
Don't be late for the train.
This medicine will do you good.
Tom is very handsome.
I don't answer the phone when I'm working.
Did you see where I put my watch?
I met him on the street by chance.
I saw you yesterday.
I want the best.
I don't think that you should worry about it too much.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
Does it make a big difference?
He needs proper medical attention at a hospital.
Leave us alone.
Make your bed.
Were you at the concert?
I wonder if he'll come tonight.
I deserved better.
That part is good.
I didn't sleep all night.
He lied to my face.
It is kind of pretty, isn't it?
Tom doesn't know that I won't do that.
It takes about ten minutes to boil an egg.
My brother has died.
He earns his living by playing the piano.
I'd like to stay here for a few more days.
She asked him questions.
How do you deal with it?
Better a broken promise than none at all.
I'd appreciate it if you'd come with me.
I don't like powdered sugar.
How can this be true?
I want to go on a trip with you.
I played tennis yesterday for the first time.
I rode my bicycle to the store.
You're the oldest.
No more than 50 people came.
I need to get myself a new pair of glasses.
Tom was a teacher for nearly thirty years.
Tom is always sleeping.
I don't want to deal with this anymore.
I don't want any more.
He had no objection.
He is stronger than I am.
We can't thank you enough.
Don't let him do it alone.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
Ice skating can be graceful and beautiful.
You can't change Tom.
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
Bread is made from flour, water and yeast.
Come in. The door is open.
Tom still loves his job.
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
I've advertised my house in the newspaper.
Let me congratulate you on your success.
I want a large tube of toothpaste.
Tom asked Mary for assistance.
I don't know what fear is.
I want to join your team.
The result remains to be seen.
Edison was not a bright student.
We are going to have an examination in English tomorrow.
I'll be your teacher.
You don't know what you're missing.
Maybe Tom should pay more attention in class.
I really like that car.
I withdrew my application.
Do you have any idea how important your test grades are?
I'm inviting you.
Do you have a place to stay tonight?
We need your help.
That is good to me.
I don't want you to be upset.
All of us stared at her.
I have to talk to you alone.
Please eat some cake.
Stop the car now.
Where ever did you buy it?
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
Watch closely.
Tell me you still love me.
This is the letter for my friend.
I went to the station.
You have a lot of strange ideas.
I will do anything that you ask.
Can I use my travelers' checks to pay the fee?
Take a card.
I'm not leaving the two of you alone.
We're not convinced yet.
You're half right.
I know Tom was distracted.
Children filled the room.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
The virus is starting to mutate.
It is hard for the couple to live together any longer.
They don't have to go to school today.
I can drop you off at the airport tonight.
The students sat in a circle.
He was shot 3 times in the arm.
You're not sick.
Tom is always working.
He does not seem to be very tired.
Have you eaten lunch yet?
They robbed me blind.
He runs a lot of hotels.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
We saw her when leaving the house.
Put the coat on the hanger.
He danced all night long.
Are you in a bad mood or something?
In the end, he did not come.
I almost blurted out the truth.
Is this Tom's car?
You're going to regret this.
Just because something is possible doesn't make it a good idea.
What's going on?
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I'm not busy.
You look like a kid.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
Tom is a con artist.
Tom thought you were drunk.
I'll join you there later.
I think that they will follow us.
Can you afford it?
You keep on making the same mistake time after time.
Why take that risk?
Some people take a bath every day and others don't.
I've made up my mind to learn how to play the harp.
Nobody cares about me.
His office is on the eighth floor.
I thank you for your honesty.
He likes it when I do that.
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.
Tom doesn't want to go to such a dangerous place.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Tom is a dentist.
I'm sure that I'll miss her a lot.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Do you study every day?
I won't need Tom's help tomorrow.
My children are adults now.
I'm glad I have a friend like you to confide in.
The work has already begun.
I fell off the chair.
Today, I went to the doctor's.
I'll be out of town for a day or so.
You seem a little tense.
He is madly in love with that girl.
She asked me whether she could use the telephone.
That's not what I'm trying to say.
Everybody congratulated Tom.
I've already told Tom he can borrow my car.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
Do you have a cellphone?
She forgot that she bought him a present.
May God bless you.
It just doesn't seem possible.
You must get off at the next station.
I knew we'd win.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since they got divorced.
The prize won't be given to her.
I cannot get in touch with him.
Have you ever seen the man in this photo?
The bridge is about to collapse.
He lives across the street.
My mother is knitting me a new sweater.
Why don't you take your coat off?
He turned his back on the old tradition.
I want to drink milk.
I finally got a job.
They were yours.
He is the greatest living artist.
Zap it in the microwave for thirty seconds.
I thought Tom died last year in Boston.
I think you're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
How does that make you feel?
If I were you, I would apply for the job.
The fire started in Tom's room.
Let's throw all this stuff away.
I doubt if it'll snow.
That makes me happy.
Tom has a student visa.
The antiques my father left when he died turned out to be nothing but worthless junk.
I can not answer your question.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
Even if it takes me ten years, I am determined to accomplish the job.
I'm not selling you my car.
Thank you for the present.
Shell after shell smashed into the fort.
I'm not the kind of person that you think I am.
This bomb can kill a lot of people.
Tell me again when the concert begins.
I want to talk to you, Tom.
Where can I do some shopping?
Nobody likes rats.
I didn't know what to do with it.
I knew there was something different about you.
I don't see why I have to go to your house at midnight.
We're all crazy.
He will be a good husband.
Tom went to Boston a week ago.
He gave the barking dog a vicious kick.
It's wrong.
I'm not easily impressed.
Your hands need to be washed.
I am going to that place.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
I tore up all the letters that you wrote to me.
Don't miss this amazing opportunity.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Let's start the meeting now.
I don't have the time to help you right now.
He who hesitates is lost.
Why did you want to speak with us?
Can you do it faster?
She is not to blame.
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
She is always buying expensive clothes.
Don't scare me like that, OK?
Tom couldn't find his gloves.
He is in trouble.
We're glad to see you.
Tom has three sisters.
I would like to exchange this dress that I bought yesterday.
We listened to his lecture on the radio.
Tom lost his only son in a car accident.
My room is always clean.
She knelt beside him and asked him what his name was.
Will you pick me up at seven tomorrow morning?
We don't trust strangers.
I wish I could play guitar.
I don't feel like partying.
Did you volunteer us?
I put on my trousers.
Tom didn't seem very busy.
I'm super hungry.
I'm afraid that's easier said than done.
I think he has enough intelligence to understand it.
Could I please use your phone?
I received your message yesterday.
I didn't want to tell you this.
I have enough money to buy it.
Isn't that better?
Portugal has decriminalized the possession of drugs for personal use.
This sandwich is good.
They were watching television.
Let me put something on.
Carelessness often causes accidents.
I feel a little awkward.
What did it turn out to be?
He can't wait to see you.
I believe this is inaccurate.
I play tennis every day.
Can you loan me a pen?
Did you open all the boxes?
No matter how hard he tried, my opinion didn't change.
We were able to catch the last train.
Thanks very much.
You make me laugh a lot.
I was really scared.
You cheated.
I'm your boyfriend, aren't I?
I've read both these books.
It's a nice day, isn't it? Why not go out for a walk?
How do you stand this cold?
Introducing democratic ideas into that country will be a slow process.
There are many earthquakes in Japan.
It's hard to tell whether Tom dyes his hair or not.
I like solving puzzles.
He attaches importance to this matter.
You two are really kind.
Let me check my wallet.
It's no longer available.
The Indians were not happy with this agreement.
Can you make it on time?
The doctor ordered me to stay in bed.
I'm still waiting.
The suspect has confessed.
Don't talk to your father like that.
You just don't get it, do you?
It is strange that you should know that.
The office where my father works is near the station.
Go back to work.
I still like Tom.
I realize I may not be the most desirable man in the world, but I still hope you'll consider going out with me.
For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
Clearly you're not interested.
Are you ready to work?
We're too busy.
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
That's an interesting piece of information.
I'm waiting for your help.
Guns don't kill people. People kill people.
I've done bad things that I should be punished for.
I have seen it a lot.
I've heard this story before.
I promise that you won't be disappointed.
What were you thinking about?
Don't worry. We'll find Tom.
I invited my neighbors to dinner.
Are you ready to begin?
It's redundant.
He was sick last week.
I'm reading a book on American history.
I had a good coach.
My sister will prepare breakfast.
Thanks a million.
Are you finished?
May I borrow your car?
Do you understand that?
Could you check the tires?
When did that happen?
I'm too tired to do study.
How dare you!
He is the spitting image of his father.
You worry too much about Tom.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Who knows what's going to happen?
Tom was unfriendly to Mary.
He is out now.
I spent my vacation in a foreign country.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
The population is growing.
My credit cards are maxed out.
Tom told Mary he could eat anything.
He denied himself nothing.
We don't control anything.
How many books do you think you have read so far?
Take cover!
Why are you alone?
What does your son do?
I can't stand it anymore.
Enjoy your meal.
Procrastinating is an art.
He has worked out a quicker way to get the job finished.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
The poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator.
It's a nice day, isn't it?
Do you want me to drive?
He did not believe anyone had the right to do so.
Where would you like to go next?
I don't plan to get divorced from you unless you give me a valid reason.
I was careful to not leave any evidence.
That dog has a short tail.
It didn't go well.
Every time they talk, they argue.
I'm skinny.
We can't be sure of the total cost yet.
It's a very long story.
I hate Mary's boyfriend.
I had to defend myself.
He testified that no money changed hands at the meeting.
Never do anything just to show you can.
I'm not impressed.
I bought a pen for your birthday present.
Can you do it faster?
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
I'm going to the police.
Did you say something?
Can you tell me how?
Tom has been quite busy recently.
Just pretend I'm not here.
There were many things that we wanted to do, but we never got around to doing many of them.
Is it cloudy?
I found the broken camera.
I wonder if you could do me a favor.
This book is about stars.
Tom wants to attend the party.
Why do our schools look like prisons?
I'm really not very good at French.
You can't pretend that it didn't happen.
I believe he is competent.
His proposal is not worth talking about.
I'm playing with my friends.
I recognized her at first sight.
There's a rumor in the air that the firm is going into bankruptcy.
What do you want to buy for her?
I need that.
He came after you left.
Life is beautiful.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lived across the street from him.
He saved us all.
She closed her eyes.
What'll grow in this soil?
Will you explain the rule to me?
You probably already know about our company.
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
I feel bad for them.
He is working on a new novel.
A child is missing.
I haven't eaten all day.
Tom and Mary decided to leave.
Is Tom an artist?
How's that again?
You're stuck.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand.
You're outgoing.
He spoke highly of you.
I asked her for her address.
How deep is it here?
I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
Are you still up?
Did you miss me?
We were talking about something at that time, but I don't remember what.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
Was Tom asked to leave?
I only told you, no one else.
Let me show you how I do it.
Could you get in touch with him?
I don't ever want to talk about it.
It's one of my favorites.
How is this relevant?
Do you remember seeing me before?
I understand I can get a bus to Disneyland from here.
Buy a book and read it.
He makes believe he is rich.
I had my bicycle stolen.
Let's see if we can figure out what happened.
You two fight it out.
I rarely watch documentaries.
He's not a hero.
How many minutes does it take to get to the JR station on foot?
Tom warned Mary.
When are you going to move?
Do you think we'll have good weather?
Glad to see you, Tom.
You're young and strong.
I just love that kind of stuff.
She did come here.
Don't try to blame this all on me.
I'll go next.
Tom found the book Mary had given him quite boring.
I'm friends with a lot of cops.
That restaurant is too expensive for me.
I don't think your parents would approve.
I don't have anything new.
The fate of the hostages depends on the result of the negotiation.
Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
You should know better.
The reporter refused to name his sources.
I just couldn't go through with it.
Do you want to take that?
I think she is sick. She has a temperature.
Tom doesn't live here.
That's the reason why I couldn't attend the meeting.
We didn't need to hurry.
Do it this way.
She sells flowers.
Are you a good golfer?
He knows everything about Germany.
They don't like to do that.
Watch your step.
It is not easy to find the way to the park.
I'm giving you an opportunity.
I bolted the door.
Did you mention my book?
Is this your first conference in Paris?
I never told you to quit.
Solve the problem.
Is that rule applicable to us foreigners?
Sorry, I can't help you.
They just wanted to ask me a few questions.
The soldiers lost the courage to fight.
I felt rather puzzled.
I'm interested in this book.
That brown hat is old.
I look forward to hearing you sing tonight.
Don't be so lazy.
Cats were sacred animals in ancient Egypt.
He thinks I'm jealous.
He was voted prom king.
Do you know the answer?
Neither of the two answers are right.
How do you stand this heat?
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
Do you want to talk about anything?
He doesn't have a job. He's retired.
If you're wrong, admit it. If you're right, be quiet.
He has to have his blood pressure taken every day.
Do you have any aspirin on you?
I understand how to solve the problem.
He doesn't want to get involved.
You're very emotional.
A dry spell accounts for the poor crop.
Why don't you share it with me?
Doesn't that prove anything?
Have you ever been run over?
My boat is small.
They said he was still weak from a recent sickness.
Don't you pay attention?
I'm auditioning for the part.
You are such a liar!
They'll wait for us to arrive.
I'm glad I invited you.
Were you unhappy?
I have to go to the airport to meet my family.
You explained that well.
Dogs aren't allowed in this hotel.
Are you coming in or not?
I think Tom did that.
The rescuers searched the surroundings in hopes of finding the child.
The Beatles gave five concerts in Tokyo in 1996.
Each of the three boys got a prize.
I want to see what I'm up against.
The price of this car is very high.
The theory is too abstract for me.
All sales are final.
Let me get that for you.
Copper and silver are both metals.
Would you mind taking a picture of us?
I don't deserve to be so happy.
Tom can't play tennis.
Hurry up and get in.
Don't stay here.
I want to go.
Do you look up to your parents?
Were you able to solve the problem?
You are beautiful.
Though she was tired, she kept on working.
No one is so poor that he cannot afford to be neat.
I'll buy a Ford.
I don't like this.
He made a gesture of impatience.
Don't touch it.
I don't mind waiting.
Do you really want to win?
There are certainly some points worth considering.
You have somebody you can talk to, don't you?
Oh my gosh! You're the last person I expected to meet in a situation like this.
I ate potato chips.
She was advised by him not to go.
The truth is that we can't live without air.
The village needs your help.
Show me the way to the bus stop.
I'm not sure what he was thinking.
Tom introduced Mary to his mother.
I just did what they told me to do.
I would rather go to the mountains than to the beach.
You ought to know better at your age.
I hate my parents.
Go home.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
I don't have to listen to this.
I'm glad to see you.
That'll take a long time.
They looked relieved.
These dogs are big.
I want to take you to lunch.
We invited him to the party, but he did not show up.
I'm going to Paris in the fall.
They say that he is the richest person in the world.
This book belongs to you.
I'm looking for an ATM.
We're in town.
Occasionally, things don't go as planned.
That's not what I wrote.
What did they do to you?
I'm glad that's over.
The car he's driving is not his.
On the same day, Apollo 11 succeeded in landing on the moon's surface.
A little louder, please.
I am thinking of going abroad next year.
I don't know what I'm doing yet.
I didn't want to wait for anything.
He always works hard.
I feel more confident now.
I want to live in Australia.
I thought that you could speak French.
Did you get the check?
Maybe I'll call you.
She was nearly frozen to death in the snow.
They were all smiling.
There's no air on the moon.
You didn't get very far.
You have to eat before you go.
We'll make a sailor out of you yet.
She slapped him in the face.
He felt very lonely.
She drives me crazy.
Could you explain to me why you think these rules don't apply anymore?
It irritates Mary when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
I can hear someone talking in the next room.
How do you think I feel?
If we hurry, we'll make it.
I let my sister use my new computer.
I know Tom will be reasonable.
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
I am an artist.
You've lost a little weight, haven't you?
I don't get along with that guy.
Don't forget what I just told you.
What do you call this bird?
That's totally awesome.
This offer is good for five days.
You aren't one of us.
I wish I hadn't tried driving home after I had drunk so much.
It's misleading.
I met a friend there.
How did you come by all this money?
Get away from me.
We need an answer.
I got lost in the woods.
I know this is true.

How far away do you think that ship is?
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
You can't just leave me here to die.
The choice is yours.
Who cares?
Can I share something important with you?
I fell in love.
He threatened to make it public.
The coffee is hot.
She went for a walk with him this morning.
I was threatened.
She's hot.
The apples he sent to me were delicious.
Nothing ever makes him angry.
What's in this box?
Was there something you wanted to tell me?
No matter what you say, I'm convinced that I'm right.
Where did you get that shirt?
Some medicine does us harm.
Tom was safe.
I know you feel lonely.
I may give it another try.
How often do you shave?
Coffee is Brazil's main product.
Have you taken a bath yet, Takashi?
If I'd wanted your opinion, I would've asked for it.
My father is in.
We can't do what Tom has asked us to do.
I was fired without cause.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Nobody told us anything.
I hope I can count on your discretion.
I just want you to know I'm sorry.
Young people like popular music.
You saw the pictures, didn't you?
Keep your eyes closed.
I had to refuse her offer.
Could you draw a map for me?
What was the time of death?
This clock isn't working.
I'm retired.
There is milk all over the kitchen floor because my wife broke the bottle.
You're not dead.
It was a quiet winter evening.
Have you tried it?
I don't like that sentence.
You must be more polite.
He's in charge of the sales department.
I'll show you around town.
I know Tom is done.
Stop worrying about it.
I want some answers and I want them now.
Can you believe this is really happening?
I'm winning.
Tom likes to write.
It's quite clear to me that this is the truth.
I'd be careful with that if I were you.
What do you say to taking a walk in the park?
He talked to himself.
She gave him a few pointers on pronunciation.
He would let me help him.
You can only use it once.
I think it's time for me to close the window.
Don't scribble here.
I got tired of waiting.
You don't know what you're doing.
They arrived just in time for the last train.
To make matters worse, it began snowing.
The man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital.
I can't save you.
Tom said that he'd be a few minutes late.
I just got bitten by a mosquito.
I want eggs.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I want you to know that I meant every word I said.
Where were they going?
How about running?
Over 4 million Australians communicate in a language other than English.
I don't like meat.
It seems safe enough.
Do me a favor, will you?
I made two.
I saw Yoshida for the first time in five years.
Tom is our friend.
He seems to have been ill for a long time.
I smell something burning.
Does Tom talk to you in French?
This isn't my key.
There were no railroads.
Turn off the television. I can't concentrate.
Tell Tom that everyone is here.
They fell into the conversation immediately.
Tom has a great car.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
I'm not going, and that's that.
Tom paid no attention to Mary's warning.
I didn't think you needed one.
These gifts are for you.
He does well in physics.
I've been doing that too long.
I know you're not serious.
Think outside the box.
Tom is a great teacher.
Tom watched TV yesterday.
She asked him out on a date.
Tom is a stubborn man.
Watch out for pickpockets.
Why is the light on?
His doctor ordered him to rest.
I almost wish I could be in your shoes.
I think that's very clear.
The meat is frozen.
I'm fussy.
This isn't a party.
He is a poet.
I think it's worth a try.
I agreed to buy it.
Tom introduced himself to everyone.
What sort of work do you do?
Tom admitted that he had made a mistake on the invoice.
I'm dying.
Stop by whenever you can.
He took a room at the Yaesu Hotel.
He is making great progress in English.
We should've done that earlier.
I am in no position to do anything about it.
We made a huge mistake.
I never had a girlfriend before.
I work for a shipping company.
The sky is clear and full of stars.
You're all the same.
I don't like the way this is going.
I'm a minister.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
Do you have any idea who she is?
We all like you.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
We're right here.
I'm begging you.
I don't compromise.
We have to transmit our culture to the next generation.
He's going bald.
Gasoline is used for fuel.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Contact her if you have any questions.
She sat next to him wishing she were somewhere else.
I don't actually believe that.
I must have made a mistake.
I thought perhaps you'd give up.
Take the garbage out.
I'm more than just a pretty face.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
His house was broken into last night.
I heard an explosion.
I regret kissing you.
We don't know what they want to use it for.
He likes geography and history.
We're all vulnerable.
Can I keep this?
You gotta get more organized.
I think that's the problem.
Leave that alone.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
He had his shirt on inside out.
Tom calls Mary every night.
I can do this with you or without you.
I never should've listened to you.
I'm almost there.
I trust you.
I suppose you're right.
This is personal.
Apart from his parents, no one knows him very well.
Why did I ever marry you?
Everyone jumped into the pool.
Shall we go and eat?
There was no response to my question.
They were very excited.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
In what kind of situations would you do that?
Would you tell me the time, please?
Tom and I are in the same class.
You're very rude.
My vision's getting worse.
Tom forgot to feed his dog.
Hi, my name is Tom. What's your name?
Stop singing that song.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
You took the wrong key.
I just feel so helpless.
I'll decide.
She slipped her arm into his.
It was a good example.
He hurt himself when he fell.
I am at a loss for words.
I feel blessed.
How can we buy British goods?
Tom missed the train.
Of course, I'll marry you.
I want to make it up to you.
Be nice.
The news soon spread all over the village.
Where did you get this information?
Did you say something?
I was very unlucky.
The TV doesn't work.
My grandmother is always complaining of the cold.
He is afraid that he will die.
I don't remember.
On my way home from school yesterday, I was caught in a shower.
I am going abroad this summer.
And then, he chased the cattle, the sheep and everyone out of the temple.
I'll be able to finish it in a day or two.
I think it natural for her to decline his offer.
I have things to attend to elsewhere.
I myself have never seen a UFO.
Will you show me your photo album?
These are probably yours.
We had a heavy frost this morning.
You are to come with me.
What do you think they'll do to me?
I like working with you.
He lives in this neighborhood.
Tom has fewer friends than I do.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
I have sisters.
I believe that he comes here.
They were spending money.
Why did you keep that a secret?
He has a test next week.
He adjusted the telescope to his sight.
The unemployment rate in Japan was 3.4 percent in September of 2015.
He turned his back on the old traditions.
He's spending too much time on the computer.
I'm sure you have many questions.
Who are you selling your car to?
Obviously, Tom didn't want to go.
I went to bed after eating.
He writes books.
Tom taught me how to cook.
I promise you I won't stay out too late.
That's what we all thought.
I waited a whole year for that.
Experts say coffee prices are rising mainly because people are willing to pay more.
You don't have to wait until the end.
I used to respect you.
Tom used to be a car salesman.
He was checking you out.
Study harder from now on.
I love your dress.
It's about time.
I am going to make him a serious offer.
I'll continue to offer advice.
She bought a dozen eggs.
Does Tom dye his hair?
Have you finished your homework?
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
In England, Labor Day is in May.
I don't remember that conversation.
I'm here to ask for your cooperation.
She looked him straight in the eyes.
Make sure that you arrive at seven o'clock.
I support you one hundred percent.
You deserve more than that.
I'm sure Tom is suffering.
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn't have done that.
I know exactly what to wear.
Tom said he'd play tennis with us.
Are you absolutely sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
Push the door open.
I don't see it that way.
I'm not surprised that Tom did that.
Do you have a copy?
I need to make an urgent call. Is there a public phone near here?
Study hard, and you'll succeed.
He's getting cold feet.
This is the house I lived in when I was young.
There is no market for these goods in Japan.
Which is your pen?
I finally caught up with my friends.
They made the right choice.
Please leave this room.
I drive.
We haven't yet discussed that problem.
He is an authority on the humanities.
They were worried about getting caught.
I'm worried about the baby.
You lost, didn't you?
I sure miss my friends.
Do you know how to drive?
Won't you have some tea?
What do you spend most of your time doing?
I don't know how to say goodbye in French.
Tom was a bit jealous.
That's what saved me.
The psychologist asked me a whole battery of questions.
We're sure of that.
I found it necessary to ask for help.
I think I'd like to be a better student.
He is said to have died.
Don't disturb me.
I don't have time for you.
Pass me the salt, please.
Why did you get so angry?
I thought you'd eventually realize Tom didn't like you.
I'm a smart guy.
I can think of some situations in which a knife would come in handy.
What can you give me?
I want to send this by registered mail.
Would you chill out?
Why didn't you call me up?
I don't remember putting it there.
I may swim in the river.
You're too trusting.
They're old.
Are you seriously thinking about buying that old car?
We're not going to answer any more questions.
I knew Tom wasn't going to win.
I phoned him.
The curse was broken.
Why do you want to do that?
I know that I'm innocent.
Can someone explain it to me in detail?
I didn't need your help.
Winter is right around the corner.
Are you seeing someone?
The delegations of both countries met in Geneva.
I can't believe I missed this before.
Can I help you in any way?
That's what we all want.
I'm going to miss you a lot.
Your father seems very nice.
He is above suspicion.
You need to get out of the house more.
Go and see the doctor.
I'm no better at cooking than my mother.
The thief was handed over to the police.
I am not in the least surprised.
I no longer work here.
Apparently, we have to do that today.
It snowed.
I know this is difficult for you.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear.
A child whose parents are dead is called an orphan.
Is he right?
You should conform to the rules.
Tom was probably born in Boston.
We traveled all over the country.
The bus stop is close by.
I wish that I could give you something.
These shoes are hers.
Tom looked at the tall man suspiciously.
I deny everything.
I can't eat.
I really do have to go.
Are you finished?
This is the house where I was born.
I only hope we're not too late.
I have food.
If you want my help, you'll have to ask for it.
Where did you meet your boyfriend?
What were you doing?
I am happy to meet you.
Have you been mistreated?
In winter, the roads are covered with ice.
I feel very sick.
Are you still asking yourself what the meaning of life is?
He can do anything he sets his mind to.
What's inside?
His neighbors are suspicious of him.
You better hurry.
I think we're about ready.
He saw there what he had dreamed about.
Exports in January were up 20% over the same period of last year.
He left early.
I was disappointed in her.
I feel sorry for her.
What you say makes no sense.
You don't have to go with Tom.
Don't make me laugh!
Would you mind leaving us alone for a few minutes?
I'm learning to play the guitar now.
Have they spotted you?
The swimmers were numb with cold.
I'm declaring an emergency.
The chest contained gold coins.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
How do you not understand?
I bet you know this.
I should have studied more.
That's not what I want.
I'd like to have these pants cleaned.
You're not bad.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
You can't imagine doing that, can you?
Where did they get all this?
For me, time is not money.
Just do what you want.
Don't your neighbors ever complain?
She became more and more beautiful as she grew older.
I like to dress this way.
It's not a big deal.
What is your job?
Do you know where we live?
Can we count on Tom's help?
Get ready for some action.
You haven't eaten anything yet, have you?
I got it.
That's what scared me.
That didn't take long.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
I rescheduled.
Would you teach me?
You were the last person to see Tom.
When did you become a teacher?
Do you want some coffee?
Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library.
Both brothers are still alive.
I was sorry.
If you're tired, why don't you go to sleep? "Because if I go to sleep now I will wake up too early."
Take the bags upstairs.
Are you looking for work?
Who does this book belong to?
There are no coincidences.
I thought you lived with your family.
Her voice doesn't carry.
He takes after his father.
She panicked when she heard the news.
I'm a teacher here.
I'll need you to be there.
I can't tell you how to do that.
They thought it would be too expensive to build a factory here.
They're not home yet.
Do you think this is real?
I can read.
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.
I just don't like football.
This is the only tie I have.
He kept me waiting.
You seem happy.
I am far from satisfied with the result.
He is nothing more than a dreamer.
I'm trying to get out of here.
She is just going shopping.
The hole is big enough.
Nature is full of mysteries.
Be nice to her.
Please copy this page.
She has forgiven him for everything.
French isn't an easy language.
Honestly, I don't think you have what it takes to become a teacher.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm not weird.
Tom and Mary had a whirlwind romance.
I know you're smarter than me.
Please fill in this application form.
We went too far.
I will buy a car next month.
I should have gone to bed earlier last night.
This book is mine. Where is yours?
We know you lied to Tom.
That's a beautiful piece of meat.
I would like to talk with you again.
Shut up!
I have less and less time for reading.
I would like an air-conditioned room.
I understand why Tom is angry.
Have you ever been to Africa?
He is tall and lean.
Have you got any ideas yet?
Are you ready for today's game?
Make a prediction.
It's said that he knows the secret.
How did we not see it?
What was the first concert you went to?
They're all alike.
Get to bed.
How did you get these?
It will become much warmer in March.
You look so beautiful.
What if they're wrong?
He's helping me.
The politician tried to cover up the insider trading.
You may choose any of them.
Please stop.
Tom claimed that it was an accident.
I'll follow you.
We're lucky to be alive.
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
Where did you find the key?
The magician made birds appear and disappear.
Do you really think Tom is ready?
May I visit you tomorrow?
He showed me how to make a cake.
You're being silly.
I'll give it a shot.
I appreciate this so much.
You're funny.
No charges have been filed.
We must start at once.
It's dangerous to text while crossing the road.
My driver's license will expire next week.
Thanks for your quick answer.
How many guests are you expecting?
I can teach you something.
It was a bad idea.
I couldn't take your place.
She had an early breakfast.
As for me, I have nothing against the plan.
I made a list of things I needed to bring with me.
I want everything to be perfect.
I thought you should read these documents.
None of these cars are mine.
Did you steal that car?
Is this one of your creations?
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
What time does it open?
I have everything.
Tom wants revenge.
I know that Tom was early.
Show me your passport.
I love hiking.
The moon was bright last night.
That's why he lost his job.
I want to ask you something.
I didn't mean to kill him.
The prisoners tried to escape.
Is eating meat morally wrong?
Your conduct is absolutely shameful.
You were Tom's only friend.
I have many model cars.
My daugther wants a kitten.
They're here.
I am a student, but he isn't.
You don't have the nerve.
You'll understand it later on.
Let's proceed with the items on the agenda.
Put it where children can't get at it.
Everybody started cheering.
Tom understands Mary.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
There are not many books on these shelves.
We saw Tom talking to Mary in the park this morning.
Tom is being held prisoner.
I told you I'm not hungry.
Are we allowed to take pictures here?
I've worked very hard.
Why are you alone?
They regarded him as the best doctor in town.
I remember writing to her.
They were taken prisoner.
She gets along well with him.
The squirrel climbed the tree.
I don't know what's happened.
When you're done with the book, put it back where you found it.
I've had to make some tough choices.
I won't live there ever again.
He is acting on his own behalf.
You're quite safe.
Tom is very grouchy today, isn't he?
I was very tired so I went to bed early.
We're leaving.
His story moved her to tears.
Our army attacked the enemy during the night.
I'll need this.
The slippery snake slithered right out of his hand.
Help me out here.
You're such a pack rat.
It is not necessary for us to attend the meeting.
Please wait outside the house.
I'm tired of pretending.
Tom is alone in his apartment.
We went for a walk.
I never saw him in jeans.
All living things on earth depend one another.
Do you want to know what the problem is?
The girl was visibly shaken after the accident.
I need a room.
I know that I'm not alone.
You can eat whatever you like.
She waved her hand to us.
Do you understand me?
How could you do that?
It sounds like someone is crying.
I really like you.
They're all bad.
I had to pay a large sum of money to get it back.
I always buy expensive items on credit.
I knew I'd find you here.
I hope someone sees this.
I hear that she is a famous actress.
I could use a little sleep.
He has his hair cut once a month.
Let's remember to do that.
Would you like to come over to my place?
I went to see a show today.
Long ago, people used to travel on foot.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
Anyone could do that.
Introduce me to your friend over there.
She was lying face down on the bed.
It was not clear what she said.
You reek of alcohol.
Just be glad you're OK.
We need more data.
I only hope you're not too late.
Would you like some salad?
I had him repair my watch.
When did you get back from Boston?
All you have to do is to wait.
He spends his evenings in front of his laptop.
You're stupid to trust him.
Is my laundry ready?
I'm counting how many people there are.
I feel really bad about this.
That shouldn't be much of a problem.
Tom cleaned the bathroom.
They are exhausted.
She was pleased with the gift.
I'm coming home.
I will sit here until he sings.
Can you put up with the way he behaves?
I don't want to dance.
The girl was carrying several books, not textbooks but thick hardback books.
Are you sure this is what you want?
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was younger.
Children should be kept away from the pond.
I study French.
If blaming me makes you feel better, go right ahead.
I'll always be here to help you.
Don't ask who she is.
They're the cream of the crop.
Who do you have to do that with?
Just forget it.
It wasn't a big deal.
She is helping him.
If he comes, give him this paper.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
He's always worrying about his daughter.
He gave up hope.
Try not to make any noise.
He speaks French fluently.
I'm about ready.
Have you got a match?
The automobile industry is one of the main industries in Japan.
You'll soon get used to Japanese food.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
We felt good.
Let's have sushi.
I suddenly realized what was happening.
This is hopeless.
I'm strict.
This one's all yours.
This is for you.
You were perfect.
I could make nothing of what he said.
I have a ring.
How are you getting along in your new job?
Tom thought that you were drunk.
Just tell me what happened.
I've got better things to do than to sit here listening to your gossip.
I can't leave work until five.
I cut myself.
I want something hot to drink.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
I think we should quit.
Thank you for asking me to do this.
He's waiting for you at home.
It was the only glimmer of hope.
I wasn't the one who paid the bill.
Tom gave me a vague answer.
They don't know me there.
Why are you yelling?
We got married three years ago.
I don't remember that guy's name.
I have three tickets for it.
Everyone liked Tom.
I love this view.
Japanese is my mother tongue.
Tom is wearing John's shoes.
I met him just as he was coming out of school.
I can't order Tom to do it.
He had a gentleness that was attractive to women.
I love traveling alone.
Tom took a bath last night.
What if you're wrong?
She mixed him up with someone else.
Whose office is this?
Tom asked me to give you a message.
A big typhoon is approaching.
Some politicians are wolves in sheep's clothing.
I think I can do better.
I didn't know you still had friends at the IRS.
I wonder who's going to do that.
I was taken advantage of.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
How many of them are there?
Which one was your favorite?
I hope you're staying for dinner.
I can't remember how to go there.
I am following that car.
My leg is still hurting.
You know I'm older than you are.
We left the movie early.
Are you going to mow the lawn today?
I'm employed by a French lawyer.
I'm not eating this.
You may still be in luck.
We're looking for someone who can speak French.
I lit the fire.
Get the door, will you?
Do you have anything to add?
I hate women who say that all men are the same.
She has no manners.
She went to a movie the other day.
You'll change your mind.
He asked for more money.
A growing child requires more food.
I know that I was wrong.
Are there others like you?
It was a huge success.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
Would you like me to do that for you?
Stay in bed.
I'll have another.
How much are these potatoes?
I was probably wrong.
We need fresh air.
Tom doesn't use sunscreen.
I've got pliers in my car.
I was working that night.
The nurse has given Tom a sedative.
Many countries depend on agriculture.
I am a professor.
Please tell me what Tom said.
You and I have the same idea.
You don't have to blame yourself for that.
He promised to bring new industries to the region, but politicians rarely keep their word.
How do you even know that?
Is there a curfew?
I'm learning how to drive.
Don't give up the fight.
It's very humid.
I think you're being a little too careful.
Tom doesn't seem to be as particular as Mary seems to be.
Tom said that he didn't want to be disturbed.
We're moving out of this apartment next month.
He was ashamed of the grades he got.
He wants to go out with her.
I don't need a job.
Give it your best shot.
The money's on the table.
I will hit the sack.
She wrote to her parents at least once a week.
I smell gas.
It's warmer.
I tried to kiss Mary.
If I knew her name and address, I could write to her.
A poor school record will count against you when you look for a job.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Do you ever sleep?
She found a need and she filled it.
This is what I want to do.
Someone has stolen all my money.
How many have you killed?
I pay taxes.
May I see the wine list?
He does not like us.
There was a lot of snow.
I haven't seen you in ages.
I know it's a great opportunity.
What he says makes no sense at all.
He hurried to the station.
Have you ever had lunch at this restaurant?
I guess not.
Tom stood there for a while.
What was it that we were told to do?
Tom attended Mary's funeral.
They invaded the country.
If all goes to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
Don't light the candle.
I accept your apology.
I have a brother named Tom.
It costs $100 a night not counting tax.
If you want to participate, you have to register.
Obey your father.
What did the guy look like?
Leave out this word.
I enjoyed spending the afternoon with you.
This book is only published in French.
Tom is a bit small for his age.
Wanna go upstairs and have a drink?
The dog must be hungry.
Was he still here when you arrived?
I'm trying to find a new job.
You need to be more patient.
You are mad.
Who's replacing you?
I want to believe you.
I was very busy this week.
Why's the engine still running?
He placed emphasis on the importance of education.
I'm not sure he wants to talk to me.
Tom won the costume contest.
Does this ring a bell?
I plan to try reading some other books.
She is making dinner.
He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't.
If they find us, we're dead.
Canned food doesn't interest her.
We were all so happy.
I opened the window to let in some fresh air.
I just had something incredibly strange happen to me.
I prefer to be alone.
That's a nice tie you're wearing.
Tom doesn't know the difference between linen and wool.
Tom had no idea how rich Mary was.
After her graduation from college, she went over to the United States.
I know Tom is miserable.
Tom was very patient.
I greatly appreciate your kindness.
I'm depending on your help.
Tom is good at diving.
I don't know if that means anything.
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
Taking everything into consideration, the result is better than I expected.
They've had enough.
She lived up to our expectations.
I can hear you.
It's so simple that even a child can do it.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
She is looking forward to seeing him again.
This office has tinted windows.
I don't see how that's possible.
Shut the door, please.
You can't keep talking to me like this.
Is it a secret or something?
The desk is made of wood.
She ordered the book from England.
There is no sense in your worrying about your health so much.
Don't hurt anybody else.
Would you like some more salad?
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
You're sick!
What do I have to do to convince you?
In my opinion, he is correct.
Did he show you the picture?
How will I pay my debts?
Driving relaxes me.
I could hear Tom yelling.
I've decided not to swim this afternoon.
I'd like to be a dentist in the future.
It's all about technique.
We aren't Canadians.
Some of us hate it.
Does he still have that book he borrowed from the library?
What does he want?
She'd like him to leave right away.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
I'll call you back later.
The saying is quite familiar to us.
I'm almost finished reading this book.
I'm not a good liar.
I'd like to be alone.
She's six years older than I am.
Do you want to eat?
He averted his gaze.
This is a very sophisticated device.
I'm going to need your help on this.
I haven't downloaded the files yet.
Can you tell us what Tom did?
She kept me waiting for over an hour.
Are you certain?
You scared the living day lights out of me!
It was yesterday that he died.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
We cross the railroad tracks every morning.
I'll take care of this.
Does he like me?
There is no answer to your question.
That sounds familiar.
I'm retired, too.
I enjoy your company.
His wife died in childbirth.
Let's just say I'm here to stay.
I want you to want me.
Have a safe journey.
Which one of these boxes do you want?
Kansas is smack dab in the middle of the US.
Take as much as you like.
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
They're in the garden.
Did you think about our offer?
I want you to be my partner.
That's not how I feel.
Tom caught the ball with one hand.
He spoke in a broken English that was hard to understand.
I'm glad he liked it.
I was surprised by the question.
The door blew open.
She looked up at the ceiling.
Don't sell yourself short.
I spent all afternoon in the park.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
What is he like?
He is able to swim like a fish.
You may or may not win.
I saw him walking alone in the park.
I'm almost 180 centimeters tall.
They seem to be having fun.
Tom has been a prison guard for ten years.
I still wonder why Tom did that.
Do you want wine?
It's your only chance.
This watch was given me by my uncle.
Don't be afraid of change.
What do you want to do in the afternoon?
I don't love her.
I think we're going to need more time.
She didn't reply.
How was your afternoon?
I'll be very careful.
My mother finally approved of our plan.
I need volunteers.
I want to try something else.
My cholesterol levels are high.
Do you have an extra English dictionary by any chance?
I've nothing to give.
I go swimming about twice a week.
I think it's true.
I haven't yet made up my mind.
Will he pass the examination? "I am afraid not."
I'm almost as tall as Tom.
Nobody likes you.
I cannot afford a camera above 300 dollars.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to drive.
She was astonishingly beautiful.
How should I know?
He will be back in a day or two.
She was unconscious for three days.
She didn't answer.
In case of fire, dial 119.
I've been there a dozen times.
She proposed giving a party.
I want to be safe.
Here's $5.
Anyone who says so is a liar.
I tried calling, but they didn't answer.
I really think you should come.
I put it on your desk.
This book has a lot of pictures.
You must go.
No other student in the class is as brilliant as he is.
I guess it's not true.
I think you need this.
Why didn't you call somebody?
Leave out this word.
He will have left here by the time you return.
My family is not that large.
Can somebody please help me?
Father got the drink for nothing.
Are you happy with that?
I'll eat after that.
He is a big eater.
Tom needs us to show him the way.
Nothing ever happens in this old village.
Everywhere he went, he taught love, patience, and most of all, non-violence.
I put my helmet on.
Where did you get all these?
I like them.
Good lumber is hard to find these days.
I can't let you do that.
I want to hear anything you have to say.
I don't know. Let me check.
I believe in getting up early.
Don't you ever come back.
I'd like to know a little bit more about you.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
We must leave immediately.
He asked me what my name was.
He's demented.
Can you walk?
Where is my pencil?
Is there anything to drink in the fridge?
The robber was nabbed this morning.
That's what we've got to figure out.
I have two dogs. One is white and the other black.
Have a nice trip.
I'm sure Tom will know how to do it.
That's what you've always wanted.
Please say hello to her if you see her at the party.
I can't believe you actually did that.
If two people have the same opinion, one of them is redundant.
I ate too much last night.
I asked Tom to keep an open mind.
I just want to thank you.
It was interesting.
The boys swam in the river.
This is my horse.
Tom certainly had plenty of opportunities to go to concerts while he was in Boston.
I'll help you do that.
She stole a lot of money from him, so now she is in prison.
Have you ever tried it?
I thought you might need some help.
Don't drink the tap water.
You're spending too much time watching TV.
I have as many books as he does.
It was supposed to be kept secret.
Time passed very quickly.
He's a lovely young man.
I like to be surprised.
I think Tom is narrow-minded.
Tom's last name is easy to pronounce.
They know things these people want to know.
Let's visit some temples tomorrow.
I am living with my uncle.
How many pictures has Tom taken?
Would you carry this up to the second floor for me?
Do you spend much time writing email?
His car is a Ford.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
There is no factory in this village.
I asked him about the accident.
Don't push me!
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
Are they Canadian?
She has a comfortable income to live on.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You can't win them all.
I think you look great.
We both have the same problem.
Why do that now?
I'm majoring in sociology.
I like art.
I don't know what your problem is.
He was fed up with life in the city.
She is sharp.
We're planning to spend our honeymoon abroad.
I teach geography.
Have your paper on my desk by Monday.
This isn't the time or the place.
You just don't know how it feels.
The explosion shook the whole building.
You know I have to go.
They wanted me out of the way.
Invite him over to watch a movie.
How come he didn't show up?
When I woke up today, I yawned, stretched, rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, and put on a pair of slippers.
It's undamaged.
You smoke far too much. You should cut back.
Who gave you this information?
I don't need a car that big.
I can do the job right!
I'd like to run a few more tests.
She didn't want him to play poker.
Can I see you in my office?
We have to solve this problem.
I hate these things.
I can't understand this word.
I looked around me.
Our fate was sealed.
Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
I hate sand.
Someone knocked on the door.
Because of Tom, Mary has become depressed.
What is your house like?
You must do it.
He is Italian by birth.
We heard a gunshot.
I'm too tired to ride my bicycle back home.
Butter is made from milk.
He's an outlaw.
There was a winner.
He forgot his promise to go there.
Lie still.
What a beautiful garden!
Father bought me a motorcycle.
We don't care what he does.
It's a real shame that Tom can't be here today.
Don't bother to pick me up at the hotel.
I feel protected.
Come off it!
It feels horrible to be pitied.
I want them all shot.
You should make good use of your time.
I need a new USB cable.
What did Tom offer you?
He's loaded.
I think you'll want to hear me out.
Why did Tom kill himself?
If today was Sunday, I would go fishing.
What's your horse's name?
I need that.
You're a filthy liar!
I only have American coins in my pocket right now.
She screamed for help.
We'll catch you.
The allegations they made were unfounded.
We can hide in here.
It was nowhere to be seen.
I wonder if there's a connection.
What are you good at?
I'm in the same boat as you.
We speak English in class.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash register.
Museums do a pretty good job preserving history.
I can eat things Tom can't.
Just relax a moment.
She has him under her thumb.
Tie your shoe.
You're new here, aren't you?
That's all I know for sure.
It hadn't crossed my mind.
Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
You're crafty.
I like to be prepared.
I hope to hear from you.
I use this desk.
If you've been drinking, perhaps your spouse can drive you home.
It's difficult to feel at home in a foreign language.
Don't cut in when others are talking.
I want to sell this.
Let's talk before fighting.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
We have an appointment.
I thought it might be better to tell you now instead of later.
You're drunk.
Are you allowed to go?
Go home quickly.
Be more careful from now on.
You seem to be having fun.
He was very fun.
You need to be more careful.
I heard that he'd died.
Tom didn't give Mary a chance.
Tom refused to take the money.
Everybody, get out of my house.
She is a typist.
I've got you.
She woke up.
Take a few days off.
She's worrying about her exams.
You haven't eaten, have you?
Tom has a cat, but Mary doesn't.
Social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change.
You need sleep.
I won't always be around to help you.
You didn't get very far.
Tom called Mary last night and encouraged her to join the team.
Several houses were carried away by the great flood.
His family is very large.
You're very brave.
Make a list.
Can we quit talking about this?
He got very drunk.
I was really young when I met you.
Tom couldn't help but cry.
I recorded the interview.
I think it's time for me to turn on the radio.
A home is more than a mere building.
They would prefer that we wait.
It's Wednesday.
Aren't you happy?
It began to rain in the evening.
We managed to get there on time.
Do you like rock and roll?
Columbus discovered America.
I'm trying to practice.
Did you like Boston?
You look so handsome.
Every member but me believes what he says.
I don't want to be seen in his company.
The number of people suffering from heart disease is on the rise.
You don't have to come see me.
He kept on crying.
A little bird told me.
I'll go shopping.
Tom is supposed to meet Mary at 2:30.
I'm not chicken.
I want to take a nice long vacation.
You're the oldest.
Fortunately, there is an elevator in our hotel.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Two tickets to San Diego, please.
They don't work with us anymore.
Would you just shut up?
The news spread all over Japan.
How can I get to the nearest post office?
Above all things, we must not be selfish.
How much is this sofa?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
You should meet him.
I didn't find anything.
Roll up your sleeves and get to work.
Tom's dog attacked me.
The sky was completely dark.
I've been watching you study.
Are you coming to the store with me?
I'd heard you'd changed.
I did that today.
I thought you liked parties.
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be able to meet so many famous people.
I knew you were behind it.
I love you a lot.
How thick is the board?
I had almost finished my work when she came.
Tom pulled a box from under the bed.
He's always looking at you.
Should I call you a taxi?
I am seeing Mary this afternoon.
I'm accustomed to working hard.
Might I come in?
Will you show me what you bought?
I held on to the rope tightly so I wouldn't fall.
Do not underestimate my power.
I know Tom is resourceful.
I want to get this done today.
You're hurting me.
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
I'm a little bit busy.
I'll be very discreet.
Tom says he's been asked to give a speech.
I'd like you to understand.
Thank you for telling me the truth.
I like to study foreign languages.
They set out for New York.
He climbed the tree without difficulty.
I wasn't at that meeting.
Will you take me there?
Are you sure you're warm enough?
I want to know why you weren't at the meeting this morning.
And who did you learn that from?
The car is easy for me to drive.
Any input would be appreciated!
He believes that the story is true.
That's all the thanks I need.
I don't know if he will visit us next Sunday.
Please step aside.
Are you good at speaking French?
You're good.
No one believed him.
What gate do I board at?
I should go.
Who forced you to do that?
I can't believe you did all this without any help.
She was born lucky.
It has been snowing on and off.
The captain controls the whole ship.
The expansion of the Roman empire wiped out a great number of the original European languages.
The salesgirl couldn't open the cash register.
I hope you have brains enough to see the difference.
I used to have a girlfriend.
You can't have fun all the time.
She decided to marry him.
I am glad to help you.
You're very intelligent.
She wants to hug him.
I shouldn't have to ever come back here.
Why don't you remember?
I can remember the warmth of her hands.
It's not for the faint of heart.
They're going to try.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
It's time to get up.
It's very pretty.
She cut the apple in two.
She refused his offer.
It's time for us to do something about that.
A tree is known by its fruit.
You need help doing that, I think.
What time will you get to the station?
Do you want something cold to drink?
I introduced her to you last week.
I suggest that we go out on Friday.
I feel like I haven't slept for days.
How much am I paying you?
You'd better go to see your family doctor at once.
I want to please you.
Stop grumbling.
Tom prefers not to talk about it.
Tom walked into the courtroom.
My sister married a doctor.
It was as hard as rock.
She couldn't convince him to accept the bribe.
I need to pay the rent.
He's used to speaking in public.
I'm taking a shower right now.
I think you need this.
He winced as the nurse pushed the needle into his arm.
I'm sure everything will work out just fine.
I have a great deal to do tonight.
This is the best cake that I have ever eaten.
Do you accept credit cards?
I have a big nose.
That isn't big enough.
It has never been done before.
They all entered.
Take your time. There's no rush.
Her unexpected visit got him all worked up.
When did you finish the work?
The radio is a bit loud.
My sister made me a beautiful doll.
Should we call Tom?
We all had a great time.
You're a snob.
I'm going to do an internship at a local company.
The water stopped running because the hose has a kink in it.
I'm stubborn.
Don't wait up for me.
We all die sooner or later.
Read your book.
I missed the point of the joke.
He has three older sisters.
Are you in trouble with the law?
He could not believe his ears.
Please be careful not to break this vase.
There is no reason for you to feel inferior to anyone.
The black cat purred, as if he was being petted.
Have fun.
Politicians never tell us their inner thoughts.
My dad died when I was thirteen.
On a clear day, you can see Mt. Fuji.
Tom had a vision.
The house was carried away by the flood.
The washing machine is out of order.
I will tell him about it when he comes next time.
You're stalling.
We already tried that.
Tom's parents are teachers.
You're alone, aren't you?
What do you feel like eating?
I've gotten used to living alone.
You should use deodorant.
I wish you'd stop doing that.
Were they in the library yesterday?
The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
We aren't as rich as Tom.
Don't be upset.
Do you have school on Saturdays?
Tom looks thrilled.
Correct me if I am wrong.
This is how you get results.
The door doesn't lock.
Billie Holliday had an earthy, gravelly voice.
I like candlelight.
I didn't give them anything.
Control yourself!
Is that all right with you?
Why is there no hot water?
I'm above telling lies.
I left a message for Tom.
Why do you think you're here?
He can't handle it.
I go to bed about ten.
Remove your hat.
They were yours.
Shut the door, please.
Smell is one of the five senses.
Both of the rooms are open.
We're going to freeze to death.
He is as tall as my brother.
Why are you all sad?
My uncle comes to see me from time to time.
I have a lot of things to do today.
I'm sure I've met that man somewhere, but I don't remember who he is.
I'll be here on Monday.
The whole world was involved in the war.
I don't need this kind of stress.
I want to sell this.
I didn't know you were so ambitious.
I'm too tired to drive. Could you drive?
We enjoy talking.
He's under the chair.
I know you want to be rich.
I want you to be my friend.
He gets a kick out of reckless driving.
I don't even want you there.
I can't believe this happened.
We have no school tomorrow.
They'll be rooting for you.
I want to spend all my time with you.
The chemical formula for water is H₂O.
Have you been here all day?
Diet is important.
I'm glad people saw it.
He is a promising young businessman.
What does this have to do with school?
The pilot bailed out before the plane crashed.
I hear Tom hates you.
Could you show me the way to the station?
It's extremely cold today.
I'll see to it first thing tomorrow.
Shut off the water.
You're beautiful.
We weren't even in Boston at that time.
He understands the risks.
He arched his eyebrows in surprise.
I hope the weather will be fine tomorrow.
You may eat as much as you want to.
You have such beautiful eyes.
Tom cut his finger on a piece of glass.
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.
Tom and Mary looked at each other, and then suddenly they started kissing.
This is a gold mine.
He hit me by mistake.
Get out of my car.
He acted like a lunatic.
Tom couldn't do even one push-up when he started training.
You wouldn't understand. It's a girl thing.
Is there something in particular that you want to know?
I can't understand the problem.
Your refusal to help complicated matters.
Are you alone?
I was going to write to you, but I forgot.
Microsoft has a completely new operating system in the works.
Do you have any pets?
This kind of mistake is easy to overlook.
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man.
They won't take it away.
Tom is trying to do that.
Grab that.
How is the construction going?
He thought it over and decided not to go.
I made sure that no one was watching.
He believes in the supernatural.
The choice is all up to you.
Tom does all his work at night.
Let's find out where Tom went.
They said they were leaving.
If you don't want to go to that party, you don't have to.

May I have your signature here, please?
Don't drink that.
It is 5 miles from here to Tokyo.
Has Tom ever told you how he lost his leg?
It was raining off and on all day yesterday.
I had a dreadful dream last night.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
Why am I still here?
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
I'm not even sure I want to see that movie.
Her story can't be true.
My mother makes cakes.
It isn't worth worrying about it.
You don't have to get up early.
My family will be away for a week.
I always have a couple of beach towels in my car.
His reply was negative.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
Where did the money really come from?
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
I find him intriguing.
Who's your French teacher?
She allowed him to go alone.
Tom is eating potato chips.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a teacher.
I'm going to change all that.
It was five years ago that I graduated from college.
I like the way you look.
If you don't eat, you die.
You're on to something.
The talks will last three days.
She lost her father when she was three years old.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
You're very timid.
I'm happy to take part in this project.
He owns a very valuable wristwatch.
Did you try to listen to her?
You've just opened a can of worms.
I'm afraid of the same thing.
I would die for you.
The room was empty.
You may go at once.
This is yours.
I forgot to tell them.
I've already fed the baby.
They say that in America anyone can become president, but perhaps that's not really true.
He looked up at the sky.
Kids are smarter than you think.
She advised him to talk about his life in the United States.
She asked him to call her later, but he forgot to.
Some people never grow up.
I heard that a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
Tom didn't know that Mary's house was so close to John's.
Where can I reach you?
You're too trusting.
What do you feel most proud of?
I know Tom is a strong guy.
She used to wash her hair before going to school.
You do like living dangerously.
He tried hard, but failed.
We haven't seen you in a while.
Thank you, sir, for your kindness.
I didn't mean to challenge your authority.
The food is too salty.
The divorce was finalized this morning at the attorney's office.
You've been selected.
It is a luxury cruise.
I think you were right.
Not a cloud was to be seen.
I found a way out.
I think you did very well.
Be kind to those around you.
He has a lot of money.
I just want to be near you.
She says that she's lonely.
I'll leave the rest to you.
Keep away from the dog.
She got in the taxi.
He doesn't live in my neighborhood.
We might need to sell our house.
Do you know what happened?
I thought you were asleep.
I'll need you to be there.
He poured cold water over himself.
He worked hard.
That's all I have to say to you.
Why are you alone?
They arrived there before dawn.
At last, I completed my work.
I don't have time.
Why does Tom want my help?
He's the one who touched me.

A crowd was gathering around him.
This is Japan.
Don't ask me again.
That girl looks like Mary.
Tom looked really angry.
Where's everybody?
You must learn from your own mistakes.
Our TV is out of order.
He crashed his car because someone tampered with the brakes.
They stopped doing that.
You're sure about this, right?
I was really worried about you.
In my opinion, he's right.
Where are we now?
Put that in writing.
I know Tom won't give up.
I'll never be young again.
I'm not going to tell you how to do that.
How big is the team?
This book is smaller.
Don't forget your toothbrush.
I'll have her come here.
Why are you staying?
I'm just glad everything worked out.
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
There are no comments yet.
We had to stop.
I felt cheated.

You don't look happy.
I just need to rest a little.
I know what they're doing.
Who are you trying to impress?
That nurse is very kind and polite.
How come you're not dead?
That wasn't Tom's choice.
What's the big hurry?
What kind of fish is that?
You stay there.

Tom is constantly texting me.
I'm pretty sure that's Tom's goal.
I've been told that often enough.
I would beg to differ.

I thought you might want some breakfast.
I don't understand why Tom brought you here.
Air pollution is a serious problem in this country.
I meant to call her, but I forgot to.
Who's the gorgeous girl I saw wandering around in the mall with you?
How much have you made tonight?
Do you see the raccoon?
Tom was obviously dumbfounded.
Let's try another place to eat today.

The box was empty.
Can you get that to me by the end of the day?

Are you almost finished?
May I go home now?

I know what to watch for.
It's a rumor.
How can you not know?
How can you afford something like this?
If I had known it, I would have told you.
We had fun at Disneyland.
Would you like to know how I did that?
How can you be sure that's true?
This doesn't make sense.
They invited me to dinner.
You don't seem very satisfied.
I asked her to go to a movie with me.
All of us went to the theater to see a play.
Give me a hammer.
I want to go over a few things with you.
We're going to eat right now.

Have you already chosen?
He grows a mustache.
We're here to make sure that doesn't happen again.
He promised to help me, but at the last minute he let me down.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
Oh please!
I love you just as you are.
I like my steak medium.
Get into your car.
Which would you rather do, stay at home and watch TV or go out and see a movie?
How dare you insult my sister!
I haven't talked to Tom.
Leave the room as it is.
What a waste!
It's really sad.
I'm sure you did what you thought was the right thing to do.
Is she all right?
I don't think I have one of those.

Go ahead and talk.

Eat as much as you like.
Let's find out why.
For your own safety, never ride in a car with a drunk driver.
I don't know what that meant.
I can see it in your eyes.
I feel a little tired.
It is no use asking him again.
Will the train leave on time?
Do you work here?
I told Tom not to come.
What do you think is going to happen?
It happened so quickly.
How did you happen to see them doing it?

Your shirt is wrinkled.
I almost caught the ball.

Are you talking to me?
Don't play with fire.
I really want to see you.
You must show respect to your guests.
You must pay in advance.
We spent all of that night, the next day, and the next night in the cellar.
How did you spend your holiday?
We gave blood to help the child.
Do all of you speak French?
You're not allowed to park here.
I don't like it when you do that.
Where are we going to go?
We're leaving tomorrow.
I remember hearing this tune before.
Can you please translate this for me?
We are looking forward to going on a hike next week.
I wonder if this is really true.
Don't talk to me.
No matter who comes, don't open the door.
I know Tom is self-conscious.
You had better take an umbrella.
Tom promised that he wouldn't do that.
That would be a wise decision.
I've never seen you laugh.
Here, everybody feels respected and appreciated.
The hotel has a homey atmosphere.
We were very tired from the five-hour trip.
People should love one another.
What does the sign over the door say?
Dreaming costs nothing.
A policeman came up to me.
That a boy!
I'm happy here.
Have you met the person I hired?
I think it's very likely that they'll arrive next week.
A house without books is like a room without windows.
Why don't we call it a night?
I'm sorry that you couldn't come with us.
I wish I could do the same.
Don't let him do it alone.
That job will take at least ten days.
I paid ten dollars for this cap.
I can't tell you what happened.
In case it rains, I won't go.
How old is this zoo?
What's really going on here?
Tom and Mary were busy.
You have only to give him a little help.
When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere.
I love that shirt.
I'm off to Turkey tomorrow.
Why didn't you wake me up?
Everyone is different.
I want to see you laugh.
He examined the spare parts one after another.
He is not what he was ten years ago.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
He is on night duty tonight.
She got him to drive.
I just wish I could contribute more money.
We don't want to take the time now.
Your smile always makes me happy.
My children are sick.
Have you lost your mind?
I had no idea that Tom was going to leave me his estate.
Couldn't we cuddle, instead?
I'm not going to eat this.
What are you all doing here?
They worked through the night.
Take as much as you like.
Tom drank a lot more than me.
You had better go to the dentist.
She hit the ball hard.
That's a huge organ.
Is your father in the garden?
I'm worried about them.
I'm not that lucky.
We're both witnesses.
I'm willing to risk that.
We drove through village after village, until we got to our destination.
It will be finished in a day or two.
I think it's time for me to leave for school.
They made me wait for a long time.
Please let me know if it hurts.
I'm just a teacher.
I can see nothing at all.
I've locked myself out of my house.
Can you remember the first time we met each other?
Am I interrupting anything?
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
My father makes good use of his time.
Do you have rain gear with you?
That'll only make things worse.
People can begin to love when they choose, but they have no choice when it comes to ending love.
I had a long conversation with Tom.
They love that song.
Let's start with beer.
You're not being rational.
I can't force you to do anything.
I finally got a driver's license.
I can not bear this noise any more.
You're scaring the kids.
They trusted you.
I don't feel like dancing.
I'm clean.
Tom registered to become an organ donor.
I want to forget about it.
Don't be mad.
He did as I told him.
This food is gluten-free.
I often go fishing with them.
They waited for him for hours.
Don't ask me to help you ever again.
You're in love with Tom, aren't you?
Don't eat while reading.
I'm very proud of my son.
It's been a long time since I last spoke French.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
I did that late last night.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
How many times a day do you look at yourself in the mirror?
Will it rain tomorrow?
Don't get too comfortable.
He proceeded to the next question.
I know Tom is a workaholic.
She borrowed the book from him many years ago and hasn't yet returned it.
Can you send the bellboy up?
You'll have to wait at least an hour to get a ticket.
I need to move slowly.
I sure appreciate all your help.
A mosquito just bit me.
The crow flew away.
This is the true story.
I know you're not serious.
They had been saving money for the trip for a year.
You're going to ruin your eyes.
The last two lines of the document are mostly illegible.
You'd better do what they say.
I'll leave Boston tonight.
I think we have some mice in the attic.
That's very personal.
The concert was incredible.
Where was your daughter?
He hardly works.
You don't even know who they are.
He only paid ten dollars for that shirt.
You have no life.
I'll risk it.
It was heart-warming.
Who caught this fish?
I bought these flowers for you.
In November, olives are harvested from the trees to make oil.
They don't pay me enough.
I don't go to the movies as often as I'd like.
Is this seat free?
I will ask him where he went last Sunday.
Do you know where we live?
I don't want to shoot.
Men, dogs, fish, and birds are all animals.
I'd like to get away from Boston for a few days.
I have to go to sleep.
Stand still!
You don't want to keep him waiting.
I don't handle ultimatums well.
Tom didn't get paid as much as they told him they'd pay him.
Are you a typist?
Almost all the students know about it.
Don't despise a man because he is poor.
If it rains tomorrow, I'm not going to the meeting.
A combination of several mistakes led to the accident.
Nobody in my family can do that.
Traffic accidents are increasing in number.
You don't have to eat with Tom, but I wish you would.
Don't touch it.
I know Tom wanted to meet you.
How do you define normal?
I live in this house by myself.
Can you speak English?
I don't have to think about it.
In June, it rains day after day.
I know all about you.
Did you have fun?
I'm a smart man.
The boy denied having stolen the bicycle.
I never want to leave you again.
Why are you so insecure?
We could crash.
You didn't need to tell me that.
I don't really like you.
Can you read that sign ahead of us?
The baby's fine.
Why don't you see for yourself?
Water pollution is another problem.
I'm sorry about last night.
There are some eggs in the box.
He's stalling for time.
He is the captain of the team.
What do you think happens then?
Can I borrow some money from you?
I'd like a city map.
Do you want fruit juice?
I need someone to proofread my essay.
I can't do anything about it now.
I told the news to everyone I met.
Go make popcorn.
Tom's wife doesn't like it when he smokes in the living room.
I was going to work.
He is influential.
A car has one steering wheel.
He was invited.
I'm asking you to do this because I trust you.
I major in economics.
Release him.
Tom will kill me.
I'm too tired to walk any longer.
I felt threatened.
You've been suspended.
I give you enough money every month to pay all your bills.
Here is your bag.
Doesn't it interest you a little?
Normally, we eat three times a day.
I get off here.
Did you write that?
When you go, I'll miss you very much.
I don't have any money.
He dedicated his life to helping the poor.
I prefer plain materials.
I'm the one who should apologize.
I really want to see you.
Tom is going to enjoy it.
How many students are there in your class?
As is usual with him, he arrived a quarter of an hour late.
The dog was burnt to death.
I live in a two story house.
I know what they are thinking.
I have been busy today.
He lives in Morocco.
As a rule, he arrives at the office about eight-thirty in morning.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom wished that he could play tennis as well as Mary.
I really enjoyed myself.
Tom is our new bass player.
I will give you half of my ice cream.
I am reading a magazine.
Which of these rackets is yours?
He was chosen captain.
You didn't cause it to happen.
Are you hot?
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
I've just gotten home and had dinner.
The more time I spend doing this, the less time I have to do things I enjoy doing.
I'll stay here until ten.
I hate this part of town.
I spent a week in Berlin living with a German family.
I think they like me.
Hey, what's up?
I know that I can do better.
I would like to know how you will proceed in this matter.
Tom is being held prisoner somewhere.
He felt nervous about the result.
I'm studying electrical engineering.
You've said enough.
I did a lot today.
That's cool.
The party's on Monday.
Does anybody know him?
What did you do this summer?
Please don't do that by yourselves.
I'm not in the office today.
I've got nothing to do today.
He's been passing off my ideas as his.
We went to the theater early, so we could be sure that everyone could get a seat.
I know a lot about it.
Go and help your brother.
She is a wonderful wife.
I went to the market.
You shouldn't cancel the meeting.
Hello, girls.
Why didn't you talk to me about it?
The girls giggled.
Park the car in the shade.
Father suddenly got sick and we sent for a doctor.
I haven't seen any of his pictures.
I should've thought of this sooner.
He was sick, so he did not go out.
I don't see why everyone thinks this book is so good.
If you want to talk, let's talk.
A smile doesn't cost anything.
I thought you'd always wanted to see this movie.
He was a good king.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
I showed my room to him.
You don't need millions to be happy.
Thank you for your recommendation.
I urgently need a job.
I buy milk almost every day.
My conscience is clear.
Did you write this book?
She studies English every day.
I want to move out of this cramped room as soon as I can.
I don't like that store.
Is there someplace around here that can fix a flat tire?
Please show me this book.
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
Tom helped.
Tom would do anything to get Mary's attention.
Tom started to take off his jacket.
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
We don't have any choice.
Friends help each other. Just let me know what's wrong.
Do you have health insurance?
Let the pigs eat that.
Obviously, you volunteered.
You're my boss.
I have to admit I'm curious.
I was young and I needed the money.
Many Americans wanted a gold standard.
Arabic is read from right to left.
Tom prefers to be alone.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
I didn't have to wait long.
Are you sure about this?
I like listening to Tom play the guitar.
That he loved her was certain.
You should always knock before entering Tom's room.
She should be there now because she left an hour ago.
Tom never should've told you that.
This is the first time that I've eaten in an Italian pizzeria.
No one asked you.
It was quiet all around.
How do you explain all this?
It's useless to try.
I'm going crazy.
I can't give you this.
It appeared as if nothing happened.
I don't feel like going out tonight.
Is that love?
Money cannot compensate for life.
I have enough money to buy it.
Who is standing there?
She seems to have been ill.
He laughed at me.
It's been three years since the accident.
Don't lose your purse.
Tom and Mary have gone.
He hung his head sheepishly.
You should've called.
Tom turned over a new leaf when he met Mary.
He is such a show off.
She was accepted by Harvard.
He died before the ambulance arrived.
Is it clean?
We found that everyone was asleep.
It was so cold that I couldn't sleep.
Sorry, I don't think I can do it.
She was advised by him not to borrow money from his friends.
You must be careful.
I'm all out of tricks.
What's in the bucket?
Tom attached the string to the kite.
I was speaking to you.
Call me before you leave.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I want to move to the countryside.
You chose a good one.
I wonder why we play tennis in miniskirts.
They were admiring themselves.
It is no use arguing with him about it.
Do you think it'll rain this afternoon?
Thanks to you, I arrived on time.
I don't understand what's bothering you.
That must be hard.
I love you like a son.
Tom was stoned.
You're a thief.
I may not get anything I asked for.
I don't mean you.
Be friendly.
Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
I started a new blog. I'll do my best to keep it going.
I ate some potato chips.
I'll be counting on you to bring the drinks.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
We want to help.
I just wanted us to be together.
I'm looking for my shoes. Have you seen them?
Let's clean up this mess.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
Can you put the baby in the car seat?
Even though he was exhausted, he had to go back to work.
She was a great help to me.
At first, I had difficulty understanding people when they spoke too fast.
Do you think I should go by myself?
What does the cat want?
Tom knew the truth, but he didn't let anyone know that he knew it.
Look what I found in the garden.
The notes are at the bottom of the page.
She spoke impolitely.
He went away in a hurry.
It was too expensive.
I've seen a lot of changes.
I went to a shoe store yesterday.
Why don't you say something?
We want you to be the team captain.
A few serious problems remain.
I don't want to play golf.
I gave you an extra hour and you still didn't finish the job.
I am staying with a friend.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
How old are the children?
You're talkative.
Get out of there.
He bought himself a dog.
Tom is persuaded he's right.
Tom didn't want me to sell my old truck.
My arm still hurts.
What narrow stairs!
If you could manage to go camping with us, we'd be delighted.
I was very disappointed.
Why are you jealous of me?
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
You're a romantic.
Let's wait here.
Did you see anyone at the mall?
They've all left.
It was careless of you to leave the key in your car.
I'll walk out with you.
The old man sat down.
What's your secret?
What did you buy it for?
Tom isn't playing by the rules.
If I had had enough money, I would have bought that computer.
You don't have to answer.
Save your strength.
I'm not denying it.
I just want you to know that I won't be able to come to your picnic.
It was your idea.
I rented an apartment when I lived in Boston.
We've lost three games in a row.
This is what you're supposed to do.
Is he at home?
Tom doesn't know how to start a lawn mower.
Why are you making that face?
The two men were business partners.
Did you miss me?
I'm glad we've had this chance to talk.
Are you afraid?
Could you sign here?
He looks much better now.
That was awesome.
I've got to get to the airport.
Do you have more than one copy of this key?
We're not going home.
Let's see you talk your way out of this one.
The plot was unbelievable.
The speed of the spread of AIDS is horrifyingly fast.
I'm adding the finishing touches now.
Come on! Give me a chance.
Now you've mentioned it, I remember coming here with my parents when I was a child.
I thought I gave you the key yesterday.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
His work is washing cars.
Tom looked closer at the food.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
You've run out of things to drink.
We had a deal.
That's probably true.
Tom is smashed.
Am I the only one that agrees with you?
John F. Fitzgerald was elected mayor of Boston in 1906.
You'd better not see her now.
Tom is left-handed.
I should've done that somewhere else.
I need to warn my mom.
Is Tom one of your friends?
Is that all you have to say to me?
Where did you find the key?
I spoke with Tom's assistant.
I maxed out my credit card.
The package was wrapped in thick paper.
Health is above wealth.
Roll down your window.
Tom has returned to Australia.
I gave him the book.
Don't worry. He knows what he's doing.
Thousands of foreigners visit Japan each year.
You're resilient.
May I borrow your dictionary?
She answered my letter right away.
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
Have you called her yet?
Some flowers bloom in spring and others in autumn.
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
I enjoyed this book.
She doesn't have a babysitter, so she can't go to the party.
I have lost my pen.
I assume you're angry.
I rarely eat meat.
I'll reconsider the matter.
The baby is crawling.
I prefer going out to staying at home.
I wonder if dinner is ready.
You must trust in yourselves.
It's because of you that I'm an invalid.
I have a hangover.
Tom isn't safe.
Some animals are afraid of fire.
How much are these shoes?
I ate your strawberries.
I handed him a map.
She ordered the book from London.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
To tell the truth, I've already seen that movie.
We're not home.
I don't want to eat here.
They camped on the beach.
I'll leave it up to you.
There is no answer to your question.
He would often come to see us when I was a child.
I refuse to accept that.
I felt so sleepy that I could hardly keep my eyes open.
Get in the car.
Many countries have signed a treaty to eliminate nuclear weapons.
He was pleasantly surprised.
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.
Correct the errors if there are any.
He made a cranberry sauce to accompany duck.
How did they manage that?
Tom hopes he doesn't become a workaholic like his father.
Tom lives in a poor neighborhood.
He never fails to write to his mother every month.
They're not always right.
I was talking about something else.
Let me ask you a question.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
I hate what I've become.
I'm not done with you yet.
What were you two doing?
Don't leave it up to chance.
She always walks to school.
Would you like to eat lunch with me?
I went to your school.
Did you drop it?
Are you the one who saved me?
We saved your life.
Someday you should give it a try.
You need to get to a hospital.
I think we're finished here.
It is important to know your own limitations.
Has Flight 123 arrived?
I spent the whole evening trying to find my keys.
I got you something to eat.
That would be nice, don't you think?
May I eat another piece of cake?
You needed me.
I'm going on vacation next week.
I think we may have met somewhere before.
I don't trust talkative people.
He made a speech in front of many people.
I'm feeling sick.
I'm planning to stay at a hotel.
That's why I trust you.
Do you understand what's going on?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Get in the boat.
Things were different in those days.
Get in the van.
It was lucky for you that you found it.
Please don't take this lightly.
He is always joking.
Who am I speaking to?
Who was that woman?
Osaka is the second largest city of Japan.
Tom seems to be a kind person.
Do you know how I can get there?
She always smiles at me.
Don't yell at me.
Tom is arrogant, isn't he?
What choices do we have?
I'll give you a ride home.
She lives in London.
Don't you ever say that again.
I do not need money now.
He loves toys.
I don't think I can do this alone.
You expect too much of your child.
You know me well.
If I were you, I would paint it blue.
Don't worry about us.
Are you sure everything's OK?
Do they know that we know?
Can someone help me, please?
I wish you were here with me now.
She told him that she had seen me there last week.
Don't despise others because they are poor.
Her voice could hardly be heard over the noise.
I suspect that you won't like it.
We're touched.
Are you saying you can't fix it?
I want to work with you.
Don't run so fast.
Let's go to the movies next time. "What makes you think there will be a next time?"
I wonder who started that rumor.
Tom kissed his cousin.
I'll be presenting a paper at a conference.
Have you seen Tom recently?
Time waits for no one.
Tom asked Mary what kind of books she liked to read.
I don't see what's changed.
You all right?
What do you want to eat?
Gold is similar in color to brass.
I almost never drink milk.
What did that prove?
I feel ready for the challenge.
Tom remained silent.
I was so busy last week.
That must've been frustrating.
I have to study for the test.
She has recently made remarkable progress in English.
Does he live here?
I love your apartment.
Tom took this photo.
I understand the sentence, but I'm not able to translate it.
They knew exactly what they were doing.
Don't approach the dog.
I can't make that decision for you.
I'll get back to you on that.
I don't feel like working. How about going to a movie instead?
Let's go if it's not raining.
Was that really worth it?
I don't want to handle it.
Could you show me that?
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
I never make a speech without being nervous.
Tell Tom what you mean.
Are you tired?
Vigorous exercise makes you sweat.
I wonder if dinner is ready.
You sure are pretty.
They are going to get married in the town hall.
Who believes that?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
Did somebody call the police?
You're eating like you haven't eaten anything all day.
She can't have said so.
I just want a little more space.
Ask Tom if Mary can take care of herself.
Could you tell me who did this?
How did you come to hear of it?
That was a total waste of time.
How do you remember that?
I will accompany you.
Can you climb up that tree?
You're not that interesting.
Tom didn't know why Mary needed to borrow thirty dollars.
I can't tell one twin from the other.
She decorated her room with roses.
We apologize for this inconvenience.
Your handwriting is similar to mine.
Lightning lit up the room every now and then.
We could be happy here.
You cannot achieve anything without effort.
You're acting like a child.
They're all watching TV.
Please go to the bank.
The show starts in ten minutes.
It must've been very difficult for Tom.
Tom is an intriguing guy.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
What else is on the agenda?
She is no less beautiful than her sister is.
We can't drink milk.
How much is the tour per person?
I know where she lives.
She is her old self again.
There is nothing like cold beer on a hot day.
I'm too tired to walk any further.
I really can't leave right now.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
I want to be more than friends.
I'll go out after having dinner.
I wonder whether Tom prefers coffee or tea.
Who is the girl in the pink dress?
You'd better try to assert yourself more.
He wants red glasses.
I didn't want you involved in this.
Nobody can solve this problem.
I'll finish it in one hour.
Do what you have to do.
There's nothing we can't accomplish.
They're happy.
Acid acts on metals.
Are there any objections?
What're you doing?
I want us to be friends again.
Is there any ham left?
I already ate.
Tom didn't really enjoy studying French.
She's no singer.
I don't like your taste in color.
Was that so hard?
What's the other option?
You can trust him. He'll never betray you.
Are you hiring?
This telephone doesn't work.
Just pull the door shut. It'll lock by itself.
He tries hard.
You're very forward.
You must be very special.
Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan.
Don't forget the drinks.
I'm not good at pretending.
They did a good job.
I didn't sign up for this.
What are you doing tonight, Tom?
We're going.
Both those students passed all the tests.
I want you to listen to this song.
When did you start studying Latin?
Do you think I should do this?
I'd rather be dead than red.
Are you sure he can do this?
I believe you.
Everything went black.
Will you do me a favor?
I can hardly hear you.
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground.
Please let me know what you want.
I don't think it works that way.
I won the raffle.
Do you enjoy Tom's company?
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
Has Father come home yet?
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
Will you give me something to drink?
Sorry for not answering your question. I didn't see it.
We have a little time before the next train.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
I'm committed.
He let go of the rope.
Now it's your turn.
I don't know who I'll miss more, you or your brother.
I ran away from home when I was thirteen.
We baked it together.
No pain, no gain!
Our fire alarm sometimes goes off when my mother is cooking something in the kitchen.
I didn't know that you cared.
The rich are different from you and me.
What in the world is that?
Can you do it or not?
You can bank on that.
Who helps your mother?
My parents are asleep.
Were you one of them?
I used to have one, but it was stolen.
I knew you'd be mad.
You need to be careful.
He got into the habit of smoking in his youth.
It looks like Tom is really enjoying himself.
I am thinking of going to the mountains.
You're free.
I'm staying over at my friend's place.
I've never heard of this actor.
The rules are very clear.
They won't help us.
It has to be done.
I don't know how much money Tom and Mary spend.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
What's the harm in trying to do that?
Let's listen.
We are going to the market.
Let's continue the game after lunch.
She wore a simple dress.
I've always admired you a lot.
One should not make comments.
I received a letter from one of my friends in Japan.
He said it as a joke.
This is a good suggestion.
His house is by a river.
I'm living with my parents.
Is there any beer left?
This looks good.
I've got a new bike.
Why don't you want to wear a dress?
He works at night.
I'm by your side.
What's the movie about?
You're a terrible person.
That's the problem we have to solve.
Tom has begun writing a new book.
What are you working on?
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
I'm trying to clean the house.
Who gave you this envelope?
My father tried to teach us the value of work.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
His crime deserved the death penalty.
Don't try to make me angry.
He closed the door suddenly.
Tom practices the piano at least thirty minutes every day.
I never knew my father.
I don't think my father is willing to lend us the car.
He excused himself for being late.
Tom wrote an article for the school newspaper.
Yesterday, a thief entered the house.
I hope you can be a better father than I was.
I wish I could remember his name.
He never forgot his ambition to become a great politician.
She is not home, but at school.
The only fish Tom likes to eat is salmon.
My nose was very runny.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
I like meat, but eggs do not agree with me.
Who's screaming?
Who's going to believe you?
Come into the room after me.
I must refuse.
We both love you.
Will you put down that paper and listen to me?
I'll play with you.
The problem remains to be solved.
I'm resentful.
I gave my seat to the old lady.
I often make mistakes.
I'm not impressed.
I'll think it over.
Every monster starts off as someone's baby.
Tom wants Mary to be happy.
I'm not going to go.
We're not going there.
I haven't danced in a while.
My assistant threatened to quit.
You'd better think twice before agreeing to do that.
I couldn't figure out how to do it.
I got you all right where I want you.
I'm nervous when speaking in another language.
Are you aware of any problems?
You don't need to think about that now.
He is old enough to drive a car.
It has a leak.
The cake is delicious.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Why do you say that?
Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?
Rest here for a bit.
Tom wants to know what's going to happen next.
Finish your drink.
I don't think you'll be able to persuade Tom to do that.
Don't let them do this.
This is twice as large as that.
Why didn't you dance with him?
I got off lightly.
I spent two hours watching a baseball game on TV last night.
You worry about your weight too much.
Tom has some friends in Boston.
Why don't you grow up?
I need a little help here.
I feel very chilly.
Eat your veggies.
I almost never remember dreams.
Could you do this instead of me?
Your suggestion seems reasonable.
School starts in September in Europe.
You're not often wrong.
I can't hear it.
We've seen it.
She is capable of anything.
Save me a seat.
He landed himself a really plum job.
He is getting old.
Water is important for humans.
He is acquainted with the custom.
The tree fell down.
I'm not going, and that's that.
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
You can do it.
Come on! We'll be late.
I have more dresses than my sister.
A stranger came into the building.
The blood was bright red.
I'm getting used to doing that.
I think I've seen this movie before.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
I'm delighted to be here.
I was wrong.
I bought the book for ten dollars.
Many young men went to war.
Are they going to fight?
Do circuses still have freak shows?
We came by to wish you luck.
Would you ever go out with a guy who couldn't sing?
He found it impossible to go there on foot.
I don't like this weather.
We're glad you're here.
The work was finished before I arrived.
You were the one who gave this to me.
Do you want me to talk to Tom about what's going to happen?
Is it the right place to sign up for foreign language courses?
I paid five dollars to him.
It would be better to try.
I think it's important to tell the truth.
I'm responsible for Tom's safety.
The cat is watching the fish.
We don't have to talk about this now.
Close the blinds.
We invited him to our house.
She is a bad person.
Tom used to be a truck driver.
Do you know what it was?
It seems that something has happened.
My headache is gone.
Why are people so careless?
My daughter was cheated.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
Do you have anything to eat?
Tom is dying.
A bright red ladybug landed on my fingertip.
My mom doesn't want me to play with you.
The plumber pumped the water out of the pipe.
Have you ever thought about becoming a teacher?
He is the tallest of all boys.
I almost spilled coffee on my keyboard.
What do you think of this sweater?
I just want you to listen.
How many kids do you have?
Unfortunately he refused to come.
Why are you being weird?
I never drink at home.
He got a master's degree in law.
It would be better if you didn't eat before going to bed.
He made it.
I'd like to talk to the hotel manager.
I know Tom is groggy.
I want you to get me a soda.
Tom is three inches taller than Mary.
Could you help me do this?
And everyone has the ability to contribute.
I told you this would happen.
I have to open my shop.
We can try.
I'd like this meeting to last no more than twenty minutes.
I recommend it highly.
Is it far?
Do you recognize anyone?
My school marks were average.
What is it that you want?
That's all I was thinking.
Can you help me a little?
How's your old lady doing?
He doesn't just speak French, he speaks Spanish as well.
I borrowed this comic book from his sister.
She does look tired.
The door opened suddenly.
If I had enough money, I could buy this camera.
Remember what Tom told us.
I should tell Tom I'm tired.
Put this in your backpack.
Would you please stop talking?
Tom, you should see this.
Don't forget to floss.
What are you up to tomorrow afternoon?
I can't eat meat.
You have everything.
The sea was calm.
You had better go.
I am working hard trying to learn English.
Everyone at the party was drinking wine.
It's a huge responsibility.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Stop that.
Knock on the door.
This melon will be good to eat tomorrow.
That might be serious.
Tom's boss is very demanding.
It may well be true.
Did you have any trouble?
I put on my shoes at once.
Tom is my boss at work.
Do you know how long they have been married?
I felt dumb.
Her new hairstyle covers her ears.
It wasn't that big.
I think you're probably right.
Tom handled the situation very well.
The students are in the classroom.
I'm running out of ideas.
I apologize if I offended you.
I'm so drunk that I can't feel my face anymore.
Tom often cuts class.
That is the same umbrella that I found on the bus.
Were you here all night?
I know that this is the first time this has happened to you.
I'm looking for an ATM.
He was stunned by her beauty.
I fixed myself something to eat.
You should allow an hour to get to the airport.
What does this device do?
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
We can go to the museum.
General Motors laid off 76,000 workers.
I think I'm in trouble.
I write in my diary every day.
I'd like to change some money.
A new room was assigned to me.
I beg you to help me.
Would you ever go skinny dipping?
They were afraid of being overheard.
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble.
He has good reason to get very angry.
Lock your door.
Turn around, please.
Who will provide capital for the venture?
Is that significant?
Today my wife and I are celebrating our twentieth wedding anniversary.
I want ice cream.
I almost forgot to pay my bills last month.
It went off smoothly.
What are the children doing in the garden?
You should have seen him.
He doesn't understand sarcasm.
I'm not very busy.
In the cemetery, there is a statue of a snake biting its own tail.
Tom bought a scarf for Mary.
How am I going to protect my children now?
Stand back!
Some Germans work for only one euro an hour.
Is anyone else bidding?
Nobody threatened me.
Get on your knees.
Nobody'll ever find us here.
Would you mind if I smoked here?
In spite of the storm, he went out.
We'd like a double room with bath.
Is it happening?
Tom left the lights on all night.
I don't want to listen to you.
He stuck to his promise.
Prince William is second in line to the English throne.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I'm extremely embarrassed that it has taken so long to reply.
Where did you go to school?
Can you help me write a love letter?
Do you think that's a coincidence?
I am a twin.
I heard you got a new car.
I'll keep that in mind.
Do you drink?
I don't want you at my party.
You sound tired.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
A solution acceptable to all parties was finally reached.
I guess so.
My son can neither read nor write yet.
I want you to be my friend.
Here's your drink.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
Have you taken your medicine yet?
Who else is with you?
I returned the book to its shelf.
How did you manage to win?
You don't look very strong.
I forgot my key.
They are good people.
How many people do you think there'll be?
I don't like this.
Have you ever been kissed before?
I thought I told you to stay in the car.
I'm not entirely sure.
Tom told me that he'd already eaten.
What fruit do you like best?
That's open to debate.
Tom could do nothing but sit and wait.
After I watched TV, I went to bed.
I want to ask you one simple question.
I've got to get back to work.
He went to school to study yesterday.
I don't get it.
How and when life began is still a mystery.
You're good.
I owe it to my parents that I am so healthy.
Tom isn't at home.
That book had a lot of pages.
I don't know what that is.
I didn't do that either.
It's really simple.
What quantity of paper do you need?
Are you up for it?
I could try.
Why are you looking at me that way?
Mathematics is my favorite subject.
That's not important right now.
She is always neat and tidy.
You'll have a hard time.
I don't know why I did that.
Don't show off.
This is almost too easy.
This typewriter doesn't work.
Is that one of ours?
You're not ready yet, are you?
Just do the job.
I thought nothing of it.
They were forced to withdraw.
The company is in the red.
We're getting it.
I hate that thing.
As soon as they return, I will telephone you.
What are we doing for lunch?
You've been warned.
Tom says he doesn't know where Mary bought her pearl necklace.
I wonder if you could get me another beer.
It is going to be quite cold.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
Could I talk to you in private?
Is Japanese taught in your school now?
We are all set.
I should've worn a coat.
He approached the door.
His behavior was anything but polite.
He wasn't exactly a stranger.
I just really need some time alone.
I'll call this evening at seven.
I suggest that you go and see a doctor about this as soon as you can.
They began to import liquor illegally to sell for high prices.
You really shouldn't use pirated software.
All are welcomed.
You can't buy me.
Tell me about your children.
I just want to hear you talk about it.
I majored in psychology.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
The implications are frightening.
I don't know anything about marketing.
This is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in.
Isn't it black?
How long did they live in England?
It may not be a dream.
Were you with my father today?
We organized a project team.
I'll study your report.
We must withdraw.
Tom left empty-handed.
It's a bad habit.
She had the box carried to the first floor.
I knew there was a reason.
My stomach hurts.
You're a good boy.
We never speak French at home.
I traveled by myself.
What do you want for breakfast?
I'm happy you two are friends again.
Is any of this true?
I'm the one that pays all the bills.
Come home as soon as you can.
I want to follow you wherever you're going.
I heard it on TV.
I have no one to go to for advice.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
They think it's a toy.
What do you have to do now?
I'm indebted to you.
I had broken my glasses, so that I couldn't see the blackboard.
Which hat do you want to buy?
I love my parents.
I spent all morning chopping wood.
I just wanted to look at you.
On the whole, I think your plan is a very good one.
You can eat as much as you want.
Did you tell anybody?
She will write another book one of these days.
I love bearded men.
The water turned to ice.
He has not paid his portion of the rent.
I have a slight pain in my side.
I could've married Tom.
I majored in philosophy at my university.
My eyes feel itchy.
I don't speak English.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted him to walk her home.
Can you talk about that a little?
It's a pleasant day, isn't it?
Try to understand this.
Save it on the external hard drive.
How could I refuse?
He accused her of having lied to him.
I didn't think you were coming.
She left the room without saying a word.
Do you have a big family?
I'm getting a lot of complaints.
Please let go of my arm.
He didn't attend the meeting.
They are very compatible.
I'll see you again this afternoon.
You can't control me.
I can't get anyone to assist me.
I think I see something.
Some of these are mine.
Could you stay and help me?
This is not a small problem.
I was miserable without you.
My daughter is three years old.
Since you're the oldest, you need to set a good example.
It wasn't very fun.
Is that better?
Tom doesn't make enough money to support his family.
Don't try this at home.
I'd like to reconfirm my flight.
I've been impressed with Tom's work.
I had stage fright at first, but I got over it quickly.
It's more complicated than I originally thought.
Are you actually serious?
You have a pretty good memory.
I don't want to be lonely.
In fact, she's quite unreliable.
We sat face to face with executives.
Aren't you glad you didn't go to Boston?
Why couldn't I be the one to help you?
He is earning twice my salary.
Could I get a receipt?
Don't blame the victim.
Are you a doctor?
Where did this one come from?
We're grateful.
There is no reason to shout.
The machine's yours now.
Today is Thursday.
You're a prude.
What's the matter with you?
A good yoga session can limber you up like nothing else.
I want new business cards.
I can see the light.
Stay with me.
We had a blast.
Tom met John in prison.
I thought you were right.
It's supposed to rain every day for the next week.
Come whenever you want to.
You can't be forced to testify against your husband.
Anyone could do that.
I'm going to put it in my room.
What're you all dressed up for?
I can ride a bicycle.
I do not know who is good enough for him.
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
They heard it on the radio.
It is an advantage to be able to use a computer.
This is the final straw.
Because of the storm, we couldn't search for the lost child.
She will be glad if you go to see her in person.
Tom doesn't eat as much as Mary.
He warned me of the danger.
We have a witness.
Tom is lying on the grass.
That's the book I bought yesterday.
Do you have some money?
Keep the meter running.
I'll be working.
Excuse me. Can you direct me to the nearest subway station?
Don't you think that's a bit weird?
A stranger spoke to me on the bus.
They were naive.
I don't feel much like eating.
I'll explain it all later.
None of you have any idea what I've been through.
I just want some answers.
Aren't you the one who's always saying we should spend more time together?
They're now alone.
Tom is going to get caught.
Obviously, I was very shocked.
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
I'm feeling kind of tired.
I thought it was Tom.
Make it larger.
He was my first boyfriend.
I like trains very much.
She has about as many stamps as I do.
Tom is skiing.
I love three-day weekends.
I haven't even unpacked my stuff.
I'm sleeping.
That's a good approach.
I don't know where they are.
Her only hobby is collecting stamps.
His identity must be kept secret.
I think that's why Tom is here.
They accused him of telling a lie.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
She picked him up at the station.
Interest rates and inflation were high.
Well, you've convinced me.
It was an interesting movie.
You're not trying to trick me, are you?
You don't have to get up so early.
You have a great imagination.
Do you have anything to do after that?
There is one apple on the desk.
Let's wait here until it stops raining.
I think skateboards are usually cheaper than rollerblades.
Let me handle it.
Who is that man?
Watch your step.
His child behaves well.
What time did you get home?
I'd prefer to be at home.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever held in my arms.
Everybody already knew that.
The patient is recovering from his illness.
If you had stuck around, you'd have met the girl I've been seeing.
Did you read it all?
You were jealous, weren't you?
She seems to be living by the lake.
When did you come back from Germany?
Let's find a way to do that.
To err is human, to forgive divine.
I'm lazy.
I can't bear the noise any longer.
You may catch sight of our house from the train.
You need to be here for your family.
I hope you two are very happy.
Did Tom talk to you about his plans for next weekend?
You're not helping much.
Be polite to your parents.
I imagined that.
How was your summer?
You're wasting time.
He wants you to come home.
Please close the door.
You are curious, aren't you?
We walked to my room.
Tom is writing a letter to Mary.
I recommend caution.
Tom still has feelings for you.
Tom is really shy, isn't he?
Tom is naive.
I never thought it'd be this easy to hack into your website.
You need to be prepared.
They agreed to work together.
Please open the package.
I'm prejudiced.
You're very generous.
I love you for who you are.
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
I will sue you.
I gave him a warning, to which he paid no attention.
Don't you think this is ridiculous?
This is the guide who took us around the castle.
This dictionary isn't mine.
I know where you keep your gun.
Please close the curtains.
The sky has become clear.
Tom has gone crazy.
That's our house.
Do you want to get out of here?
I'd like some time alone, please.
It's not real.
He was acquitted.
I promise that you won't be disappointed.
I'm asking what you think.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
I wonder who.
I walk my dog in the park every morning.
Draw a circle.
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your classmates.
The baby is growing up.
I'd love to get rid of this old car.
This door won't open.
How's your mother?
Don't make me shoot you again.
We didn't recognize each other.
Your wish will come true in the near future.
I was very reluctant.
I have no excuse.
You must study grammar more.
You can do whatever you want to, of course.
You're very timid.
Don't be so outraged.
Do you think it's dangerous to eat genetically modified food?
He has done better than last time.
Can you give him first aid?
You don't want to point that gun at me.
Who do you think he is?
Tom disagreed.
Tom took out a bag of marshmallows.
I don't believe you. You're always telling lies.
Heavy rains fell for more than a day.
It was not until yesterday that we noticed the animal missing.
I was disappointed in my son.
When did you go to work?
He is teaching me.
By the way, where do you live?
I know Tom is a librarian.
How did you get hurt?
I can't believe I kissed you.
He has a lunch.
Where will we eat breakfast today?
I ate absolutely nothing the whole day.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I am an office worker.
That's what Tom and I were told three hours ago.
I need to get another lawyer.
Everybody hates you.
They just taught me to swear.
Let's have a glass of champagne.
I inspired my students to work harder.
I want you to tell me the truth.
I'll take care of this.
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore.
Are you Catholic?
May I ask what you're working on?
I think you want this more than you want to admit.
Tom is a person you can trust.
Tom is going to be thirty next year.
I'd rather walk than wait for a bus.
I'm working on a big project.
It's almost half past eleven.
I appreciate your patience.
Tom has a girlfriend.
Pick it up.
It's not polite to stare at others.
I'm sorry I don't have my watch with me.
We have something special for you, sir.
Do you think I'm pretty?
If you can't solve this problem, ask your teacher.
Tom seems to be able to speak French fairly well.
I'm honest.
Give me the sword.
Tom will obey.
I have no use for it.
The medicine made me sleepy.
He had a hard time making himself understood at the meeting.
I brushed my hair.
The couple separated, never to see each other again.
They failed both times.
I want to know when my baggage is going to arrive.
Who approved this?
This game is so hard.
She became a mother when she was fifteen years old.
They work hard.
You've been a big help.
It's against my morals.
I've given up on the idea of buying a house.
She couldn't afford it.
He is one of the greatest scientists in Japan.
You can't put two saddles on the same horse.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.
I see you had to work late again last night.
I broke my leg skiing.
His curiosity knew no bounds.
She has her faults, but I like her.
The hostages will be released.
Why was Tom fired?
Because of rain, I could not go out.
You're wasting my time.
I discouraged him from going swimming because it looked like it was going to rain.
There was no one on the beach.
I can resist everything but temptation.
Don't respond to that.
Without a passport, leaving a country is out of the question.
Please treat the cat well.
It's not my cup of tea.
It will cool down tonight.
The storm sank the boat.
Does this mean you won't be sleeping here?
Switzerland is a beautiful country.
Tom is the best man for the job.
Her one wish was to see her son again.
I just have to do something.
He'll be here any second.
He treats his employees well.
We haven't talked to each other since the accident.
I want you in my office in one hour.
I want to be careful.
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
Don't look back.
I'd like to join a night bus tour.
You're getting closer.
I didn't want to look foolish.
I'm planning on staying at his place tomorrow.
I don't yet know what we're supposed to do.
Tom is important.
He has a cold.
I thought it was good.
I feed meat to my dog.
Japanese people tend to think that way.
I'm letting you go.
I lost sight of her in the crowd.
Why does everything happen to me?
What could they possibly want from us?
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
I am glad to see her.
Would you please wait for a few minutes?
The middle one is mine.
I worked in Boston for three years.
France has a higher birthrate than most of Europe.
What are some foods you usually eat with chopsticks?
We grow a variety of crops.
I felt somebody patting on my shoulder from behind.
Where's Tom this morning?
You don't deserve to live.
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
They concluded he was lying.
That wouldn't be any fun.
He's a late bloomer.
He wore a pullover sweater to keep from getting cold.
I asked her to call me at five o'clock.
I'm married.
Are you their mother?
You're too trusting.
None of us knew the answer.
They looked relieved.
I bought this TV from Tom.
She brags about how well she can cook.
You've been warned.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
We would like to reserve a table for 6 o'clock.
Be sure to check in at least 45 minutes prior to departure time.
I'm very worried about you.
Tom took the scissors away from Mary.
I felt relieved.
The Internet is an invaluable source of information.
The man who makes but one mistake a year because he makes but two decisions is wrong fifty per cent of the time.
Why isn't that an option?
What season do you like the best?
She's much better today than yesterday.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
Come downtown with us.
Does he know what you did?
If she expects them to give her five days off work with pay, she's going to be disappointed.
Mothers often pamper their children.
I'm not a magician.
You're incredible.
Have you ever argued with your parents?
Whose clock is it?
I'm delighted to meet you.
I've just arrived at the station.
Why are you insulting me?
It's difficult to understand his ideas.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their natural talents.
I want a car, but I have no money to buy one.
He put the skis on top of the car.
I don't know how to play pool.
How is your daughter?
Keep quiet!
I don't need a new TV.
Can you at least be happy for me?
You can use a dictionary for this exam.
Yesterday we painted the town red.
It is dangerous for you to swim in this river.
Mary finished applying her makeup.
I'll wait till noon.
I'm tidy.
Tom's goal is to own a home before he's thirty.
He pushed me gently.
We're going to fight.
Will it rain this afternoon?
I don't see them anywhere.
I think you're ready.
Tell me again how much money you have.
No one will vote for the budget.
I am uncertain as to whether I am the right person for the job.
Tom goes to the barber less than four times a year.
I lost three kilograms.
I don't like this.
Get a good night's sleep.
Don't you ever touch me again.
I'm really not all that hungry.
Where did you get this information?
You may not be as lucky next time.
Tom is a client.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
I think it's about time to go.
Don't drink out of my glass.
There you are.
The athletic meet was put off until next week.
I've never seen anything like this before.
How good is he?
I don't have a bicycle.
There has been no rain for two weeks.
I bought a book of folktales.
I'll call you some other time.
He seems very sleepy.
I can't tell you what you want to hear.
Luckily nobody got killed.
Please write down your name.
You're faithful.
Tom was nowhere in sight.
All I want is a washing machine.
She likes him.
I want my room painted white.
I see.
We want to help Tom.
Yesterday, I bought a book.
Show me how to do this.
I don't really care.
We'll start this afternoon.
Just shut up and listen.
That would be a good start.
You should take the appropriate measures at the appropriate time.
Why don't we duck back inside?
They don't know my name.
I had fun last night.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
I want some potatoes.
Do you know what love is?
I'm surprised to see you smoking. You didn't used to.
Stay awake.
The police followed up all their leads, but came up empty handed.
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
You would like it.
I know where you were yesterday evening.
I don't even want you there.
They de-iced the bridge with salt.
We seized the town after a short battle.
Laughter is like a windshield wiper. It can't stop the rain, but it lets you move ahead.
I had no intention of doing so.
How did Tom and Mary meet?
Can you play the piano?
I guess I'd better get back to work.
Does everybody understand?
The world doesn't revolve around you.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
I'm the tallest one in the class.
That is the worst thing you can do!
Something is odd here.
They made her go.
Instead of going to Boston next summer, let's go to Chicago.
Milk makes us strong.
I like them all.
What will the newspapers say?
Where do you write?
Did you get my email yesterday with the instructions?
Take mine.
I love comic books.
I'm happy that you were able to find a job so quickly.
We wanted to wish you good luck.
Tom has no prior criminal record.
He plans to buy a new bicycle.
Tom is just like you.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
No one ever tells us anything.
He's the same age as me.
I don't think she is fit for the job.
How is your weekend going so far?
I recommended Tom for the job.
I agree with you.
She told him where to put the suitcase.
Why are you angry? "I'm not angry!"
I didn't want to bug you.
Tell us what you did last weekend.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
The government should invest more money in agriculture.
I'm double-parked. Could you hurry it up?
We're being attacked.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
I'm sure he will come tomorrow.
What do you like about her?
That doesn't sound stupid to me.
That made me think of you.
Sing us a song, please.
Don't forget to sign your name.
What did you call me?
Tom isn't ashamed of what he did.
None of these are good enough.
She thanked him for his help.
Have you ever wanted something so much that you'd do anything to get it?
I asked her if she could go to the party.
Tom and Mary look very happy together.
I can't eat all this.
I wouldn't mind a beer right now.
That could take weeks.
You do not want to incur the wrath of God.
Tell me where you went.
Don't let your feelings show.
Do you want me to wait?
Listen to what I am saying.
Tom needs money for college.
That's useful, isn't it?
I think Tom may be mentally ill.
His essay was full of original ideas.
You really want to do this, don't you?
You have a watch.
I let you down.
How far away do you think that ship is?
I have a part-time job.
You're joking!
I ran in order to be on time.
He slept in the car.
The wound left a scar on her arm.
I'll go in first.
It's probably just a phase.
I'm going back to college.
There isn't any solution.
I want you to call it off.
It was very beautiful.
Keep an eye on him.
This is the hospital I was born in.
Tom has been growing a beard all summer.
I guess it's too late to do that now.
His teaching methods are highly unorthodox.
In Massachusetts, a man is not allowed to marry his wife's grandmother.
I studied a lot in school.
The house appears to be empty.
Let Tom sleep.
I see you had to work late again last night.
That's not what you want to do.
Tom played golf last weekend.
Where did you meet my father?
Is there a youth hostel near here?
I'm going to take some pictures.
I corrected it.
I won't go.
We're always hungry.
I will go with you if necessary.
We'll never forget your kindness.
Everyone kept talking.
We couldn't open the door because it was locked from the inside.
They look cool.
All the world desires peace.
These people are amateurs.
Tom seems nice.
Tom got remarried recently.
The answer to both questions is no.
I'm really shocked.
Let's get started.
The trouble is that she lacks experience.
I think you have my umbrella.
I need to have a word with you in my office.
Can I speak to the head nurse?
We've solved the problem.
How did you know it was me?
I thought we were going to die.
You're the one who trained me.
It doesn't work yet.
You don't know what it is to be poor.
World War II ended in 1945.
You don't need to wait.
We met the other day.
With all your money, you should be able to buy just about anything you want.
Write on every other line.
I didn't expect to be here so soon.
Tom is a geologist.
No wonder they turned down her offer.
She lost what little money she had.
It's not possible.
Put on your pajamas and go to bed.
I really need to catch the first train tomorrow morning.
He's nervous and easily frightened.
Can you get our bags?
I'm really disappointed.
A lot's happened while you've been away.
Everyone loves that place.
I just told him.
I had a kidney stone.
That's why I called you.
It was disappointing.
I'm on my way to visit a friend who's in the hospital.
Don't you think that's probably a good thing?
I'll draw a map for you.
Are you all right?
If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.
I'd like to play tennis.
What if he's wrong?
Apples were served as the dessert.
I'll arrange that for you.
He often writes to his parents in Japan.
From here on out, it's smooth sailing.

Tom's scared.
I deserved that.
Japan is to the east of China.

Considering what time it was, the supermarket was relatively empty.
Who did you give the book to?

I know how to win.
I nearly fainted when I heard the story.
His family and his doctor urged him not to go.
Why do you feel that way?
We are encouraged to use our imagination.
Please close the door.
May I turn down the TV?
She warned him not to go alone.
I'm very tired. I don't feel like taking a walk now.
Leave this to me.
I bought an eight-acre farm for my retirement.
She's as busy as Tom.
The electricity went out, but it's back on now.
You're safe now.
Teaching young children isn't easy.
Do I look like a plumber?
How on earth can you speak that language?
I had no idea you were involved.
His face brightened.

I'm concentrating.
I'll stay here until ten.

Tom was sitting near a very attractive woman.
Is the horse black?
I noticed that she sat in the front row.
I have a lot of bad teeth.
All the boxes are empty.
Don't make fun of them.
Nobody knows what to say.
Don't you want to know what I want?
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
Don't be upset.
Have you finished breakfast yet?
I don't know what'll happen.
I can't control it.
You are too late.
That's how I came to know her.
Be careful!
I wish I could stay longer.
What're you writing?
I'm slow to adapt to new situations.
I began to doubt the accuracy of his statement.
Who forced you to do that?
It was foolish of him to do such a thing.
Where else should we go?
Is Tom an actor?
You mustn't lie.
I want you to remember this moment.
You don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it.
The lubrication system was poorly designed.
What's the difference?
I'm accustomed to this.
Did you drop it?
Is it a recent picture?
Those are my grandmother's dentures.
We need to make up for lost time.
Tom is a journalist in Boston.
How is your daughter?
No problem.
Didn't you read the prospectus?
Where can I get some help?
He'll do whatever you ask him to.
The dog ate my shoe.
There are some things that you should never try doing.
Who do you think that man is?
She did it carefully.
I knew Tom knew who was going to do that.
She was a bundle of nerves last night.
Have you already decided on your thesis topic?

This is an old letter.
I sell umbrellas.
All of them will get a prize.
This road is dangerous.
You gotta get more organized.
Everything is OK.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
He's going to cross the river.
We're just having a good time.
How can we tell?
I felt as if I had no choice.
Where did you get those strange-looking shoes?
The rumor spread quickly.
Tom is one of the wealthiest men in the country.
Could you press this button?
I went there for the purpose of meeting him.
I need to find a better job on the double to pay my bills.
I left my gloves in the library.
Is this pure gold?
Tom's house burned down.
You're not my friend.
You're sick!
If you need help, I'll help you.

That was so cool.
I was very tired.
You're surrounded.
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one.
I got shot at.
How did this happen?
You have to make the crease very straight.
I don't like that one.
I'm only going to show you once.
The news made them happy.
I felt I just had to get off the ship.
What do you want me to say?
Can you come to my house tonight?
The taxi has arrived.
I know Tom is smart.
It is their last movie.
You don't look very good.
Please make yourself at home.

I feel really stupid.
It's rather cold for April.
There's nothing better than that.
They lie all the time.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear and she nodded.

I remember hearing the story once.
Can you wait a minute?

Why didn't you run away?
Feed the bird.
You're not allowed to eat those.
I got married.
I do the best I can.
They missed the deadline.
Even if you go far away, let's keep in touch with each other over the phone.

I'm glad no one got hurt.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
I'd rather die than give you this.
I need to think about that.
Tom asked Mary to meet us here.
Why didn't Tom answer Mary's letters?
I just wanted to say thank you.
That's not what I hear.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
Let's stop wasting time.
An image is worth a thousand words.
Eleven is a prime number.

We've got to get you to a hospital.
I'm not evil.
Tom ran as fast as he was able to.

Don't be afraid to try new things.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.

Put yourself in my place.
She wanted to have her father's love to herself.
They said it's OK.

How many times have I told you?
Is there something in particular that you want to see?
She likes the teacher.
At the foot of the hill is a beautiful lake.
He likes it when I do that.
I'm all for your suggestion.
Are you certain that's what you want?
I don't want you to get involved.
The pleasure's all mine.
You may go anywhere you like.
How do you think it made me feel?
Sunday is followed by Monday.
Sorry about the mess.
The air was full of flying bullets.
The big fire reduced the whole town to ashes.

He answered my question easily.
You're very generous.

As soon as I finish writing the report, I'll send it to you.
Will that make any difference?
Is that the only way out?

Is there something in there?
It's not weird.
I can give it a try.
You should act more calmly.
Would you like anything to eat?

I never received the money.
That was totally amazing.
There's something about Tom that I don't like.

These are questions that I can't answer.
A plastic cup is better than one made of real glass.
How long will you stay here?
Your hair will grow back.

How long are you going to keep giving me the silent treatment?
Tom hated that.
You don't need to know.
Did I embarrass you?
I was a bit embarrassed.
He has been secretly in love with her.
I suggest that you don't say anything about this to Tom.

Did you turn the stove off?
The lock on my drawer had been tampered with and some of my papers were missing.
Washing the car took longer than we expected.
I have been expecting you.
It was locked.

What's your phone number?
I'm supposed to do that by myself.
It's too early.
There are plenty of fresh eggs on the table.
I know you love me.
What are your weekend plans?
People are stupid.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
Maybe he likes you.
I can't wait for Tom.
How come you didn't call me last night?
Do you know where they come from?
Monkeys can learn a lot of tricks.

This is mine, isn't it?
She fooled him.
I think it's time for me to buy my son a car.

I had things to think about.
The cat scared me.
We have to find more chairs.
How long are you planning on staying?
We were all disgusted.
Tom says he'll never do that.
There's something I need to tell you before you leave.
I don't really want to bother you with my problems.
She explained the reason why she was late.
Tom doesn't know how strong you are.
Tom taught me French.
His plan was discarded.
What did he do after that?
Am I going to need a lawyer?
What a disaster!
I was forced to accept her proposal.
I believe this was unnecessary.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
What time will you leave?
Why do I have to sing with Tom?
Don't bother doing that now.
Has anyone in your family ever been arrested?
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
You think you're awake, but you may, in fact, be dreaming.
This is really hard.
Tom made the same mistake again.
He broke them.

Do you know where Tom went?
You look sick.

He never said it again.
What he said turned out to be true.
Could you tell me how to get to Park Street?
Her parents hate me.
I was busy this week.
Am I interrupting anything?
Don't expose this chemical to direct sunlight.
Hello, is the accountant there, please?
Take your hand out of your pocket.
He will have left here by the time you return.
I suggest we hurry.
Tom stole Mary's passport.
His father had died of cancer 10 years ago.
Mother Nature is generous.
I'll meet you there.
Do you come here often?
After decades of civil war, order was restored.
I've always wanted to meet Tom.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
Tom never came back.
Shouldn't you be studying?
Don't be such a fool.
My son always gets sick when he rides a bus.
I don't feel like singing.
What are you suggesting?
I have looked for it up and down.
I don't have anything to write about.
I wonder why Tom always does that.
Why does this happen so often?
We left immediately.
She is fond of playing tennis.
I am surprised to learn this.
Do you want to come sit by me?
I can't afford it.
I have no idea why it is so.
She wondered which door to open.
This time I'll try it.
Am I under suspicion?
I gave you fair warning.
Just give it a shot.
Could you send it by email?
All but one were present.
I felt cheated.
Stop teasing your brother!
Tom is going to be back later today.
Hold out your left hand.
We have plenty of time tonight.
Wait for us in the lobby.
A heavy rain began to fall.
My dream is to go to Japan someday.
That guy is completely nuts!
Please don't tell anyone.
I don't have the energy.
He arrived in time.
I usually get up at six.
Don't use all the hot water.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
We have something very important that we need to discuss.
Tom despises Mary.
You are very courageous.
Who's making the decisions?
I'm tired of being sick.
It's no use complaining.
We'd better go back in.
Not knowing what to answer, I kept silent.
I was a bad student.
Thanks for stopping by.
Are you almost ready?
I don't mean to challenge your theory.
He speaks quickly.
If he keeps threatening you, then you should go to the police.
What is the length of this piece of cloth?
Don't point your gun at anyone.
He fought against racial discrimination.
You're very good.
Tom isn't trained.
Check that.
She ignored him almost all day.
I should have come earlier.
I had a family emergency.
I don't really want to go there by myself.
Why exactly did you do that?
Would you like to come over for dinner after work on Monday?
Nobody wants it.
He's still at work.
Is your mother at home?
Kennedy Airport, please.
I had little to do with it.
Tom's father was a diplomat.
I always get nervous in her presence.
I don't plan to vote in the upcoming elections.
He was surprised to learn this.
Open your book to page ten.
We should celebrate.
His birthday just happens to be the same as mine.
She pretty much keeps to herself.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
I forgot that today was Saturday.
Don't try to be a hero.
The man caught the girl by the wrist.
Tom wanted to eat spaghetti.
He turned down our proposal.
I don't know how to contact you.
I have no money on me.
How will you change this?
You're resilient.
You recognize her, don't you?
I couldn't resist the temptation.
Our destination is still a long way off.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Both Tom and Mary work full time.
One thing I've always wanted to do is get a decent job close to home.
He talks too fast.
I left my guitar in your office.
Come down from the tree.
This mission entails huge risks.
She helped him tie his tie because he didn't know how to.
She didn't intend to let him drive.
That blow on the head knocked him out cold.
I'm very sorry to have troubled you.
I'm the boss.
Where did you get your hair done?
I came here of my own free will.
Are you interested?
Which kind of music do you like?
My grandma injured her leg in a fall.
You said I was beautiful.
I am not the person I used to be.
I'm sad.
Where are you from?
It was a case of mistaken identity.
That meeting was a waste of time.
Can you imagine what life will be like for them now?
Tom is a very ambitious person.
Are you awake?
Why is insurance so important?
You were right and I was wrong.
You're lucky that you have a job.
You changed it?
I had nothing to do with it.
She wasn't able to talk to him.
You look incredible.
What'll they do to Tom?
I like the way you sing.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
Do I look busy to you?
If Tom were here, he'd know what to do.
We're going shopping.
Is this your umbrella?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
She was more beautiful than all of the others.
Is Tom really going to eat that?
Airplanes land at airports.
It's still not right.
Tom is the only one who knows the combination for the safe.
Don't touch that dial.
Tom hasn't replied to my letter.
Nobody knows his name.
Tom scratched his name off the list.
She has been busy since yesterday.
I want you to do some research.
You can't bury your head in the sand.
He's doing his best.
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
They're mine.
He did all the legwork.
Don't lie. Tell the truth.
Have you ever been lonely?
Do you want to see some magic?
What are you doing this evening?
The station is the middle of the city.
I know Tom is prejudiced.
You don't need to tell me what to do. I already know.
Finding his office was easy.
I must continue.
Americans have the right to bear arms.
I don't belong.
I heard everything you said.
Tom would like to visit the Eiffel Tower.
Leave out this word.
He does nothing but complain from morning till night.
You were drunk, weren't you?
I'm still married.
I don't know his address.
You can't change Tom.
They live in a house.
That's an excellent suggestion.
I was busy yesterday.
He applied for the job and got it.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
I'm afraid the rumor is true.
I really like this restaurant.
He got out of the cab in haste.
I'll take care of you.
Hand in your papers.
He bound the package with a string.
I enjoy reading.
I can't distinguish him from his brother.
That sounds like the kind of thing he'd do.
I don't have my passport with me.
That's what we want to know.
The baby was shaking the rattle.
Our company has a long, long history.
My father is rich.
They're very smart.
If you don't bother the bees, they're unlikely to sting you.
I didn't know what I was getting into.
I know that Tom can't understand French.
They killed Tom as an example to the other prisoners.
Tom and Mary are older than John.
I want to meet Tom.
I don't know who my real parents are.
Tom is writing on the blackboard.
It seems well written.
How do you usually decide what to eat?
Why didn't you say that before?
Please make the bed.
We're going to finish this.
May I use the bathroom?
I didn't catch your last name.
Ask her when she comes back.
Whose books are those?
She couldn't convince him to give a speech.
Tom likes to listen to music while he's doing his homework.
I'm no longer afraid of dogs.
Tom read the poem out loud.
Tom kissed Mary on the cheek.
Shadow him.
I don't like being interrogated.
Thanks to you, I spent all my money.
Don't forget to pay the phone bill.
You're not expecting me to help you, are you?
She is very annoyed with me.
I think that's the best answer.
You're very perceptive.
Please heat the water.
Give me five tokens, please.
How can I do that?
There is a map on the wall.
They stopped doing that.
I felt so uncomfortable.
I live in Kobe.
Tom will be overjoyed.
Tom isn't going to wait.
You're not telling me the truth.
Change is possible.
I agree with that opinion.
Tom said Mary was there.
Is there anything on the floor?
The changes are startling.
My mother likes tulips very much and so does my sister.
What do you need exactly?
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.
There are so many things I'd like to do.
What's the fun in that?
Turn around, please.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
Let me off at the train station, please.
We avoid talking about politics.
The kids are driving me crazy.
You're not very funny.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
They got the prize.
Wolves usually don't attack people.
That would be almost perfect.
Your plan didn't work.
I'll tell you what's happened.
Where have you been for the past three months?
I hate this.
You've been cleared of all charges.
It took me three hours to finish my homework.
Where did you go to school?
Let me check.
I made a big mistake when choosing my wife.
You are wanted on the phone.
You look like a boy.
Cuban cigars are among the best in the world.
Choose whichever you want.
That's why I quit.
I reconsidered your proposal.
He's been working all day long.
The traffic accident deprived the young man of his sight.
I'm really concerned about your future.
Open the door, please.
That's not what he said.
I was playing a game when I felt an earthquake.
Not everyone agrees.
Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?
It's raining cats and dogs here.
I didn't break the law.
Some were under the impression that the judges had not chosen wisely.
They went there.
I made my dog lie down.
I like being on the team.
What a colossal waste of time!
He demands immediate payment.
Would you like to talk about what just happened?
How did you get them?
I can see myself in the mirror.
I was on my way to see you.
Frankly speaking, I hate him.
I hope you brought coffee.
I want to shake your hand.
He had called the rebels traitors.
Close the drawer.
That's ludicrous.
I was very tired.
It must've rained during the night.
He heard the dog barking.
I can run the fastest of the three.
You can't kill us both.
There are holes in the floor.
He pressed his ear against the wall.
We're not perfect.
You've got a great memory.
Do you like the way you look?
Take a look at this.
I'm sorry, but it's just not possible.
You're naive.
We want them to follow us.
Is it really so terrible?
Japanese children are group members even when they are sleeping.
Can I ask you something personal?
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
Tom wore a camouflage jacket.
How could you just walk out the door without saying goodbye?
Why did you listen to them?
A young man broke into my house last night.
She is living abroad.
That request was denied.
Don't trust people who praise you in your presence.
Drinks are on me.
You don't have to do this.
I can't hear anything because of the noise.
A female friend of mine loves to go to gay bars with me.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
I love this group.
I've never heard of that city.
You can't burn anything without oxygen.
I just can't help you right now.
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
We shouldn't lose courage.
He never fails to write to his mother every day.
Can you see the big white building over there?
Is this your child?
I think you're sitting in my seat.
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
I didn't know you had a dog.
Tom left his sunglasses in his car.
I used to go out with friends every weekend.
I'm resourceful.
Would you like to see my new car?
He cleared the roof of snow.
We didn't kill Tom.
What are you going to tell me now?
What part of Australia are you from?
Can I have a moment with you?
He didn't tell me everything.
How can I make him stop?
I never thought it would be so exciting.
He isn't actually the manager.
I feel like I missed something.
I want you to help me clean it up.
I wonder what Tom would do in a situation like this.
That tastes terrible.
I was supposed to do that yesterday.
Tom couldn't find a job.
It is difficult to talk to him.
This made me very sad.
He is about my size.
It is a great pleasure to be here.
Don't take any chances.
There were a hundred people in the hall.
It is hard to win four successive games.
Cars arrived there one after another.
What's our plan?
She writes to him every week.
I've fallen in love with you.
Was I not supposed to eat yet?
I don't want to do that.
I've hired an assistant.
The cat is licking itself.
How long were you there?
They released Tom.
We had fun yesterday.
Are you sure?
I don't mind helping.
Watch the rear. I'll watch the front.
How long have you been working here?
I'm not finished yet.
Tom knows how to have a good time.
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that.
I was really frustrated.
It's okay to take it easy sometimes.
Please do whatever you think is necessary.
Which one's the new one?
Will he ever forgive me?
Have a nice vacation.
That's just a cheap publicity stunt.
This happens all the time.
Could you give us a moment?
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
I made a few calls.
That hotel is very near the lake.
That is the duty of the police.
He was sitting with his arms folded.
Am I interrupting something here?
Everyone was friendly to the new girl.
I don't believe any of this.
The writer is well known to us.
Today, we had two false alarms.
We've finished.
Do you think she's attractive?
You are an idiot to go out in this weather.
Can you tell me what this is?
I can't just stay here.
According to my calculation, she should be in India by now.
The epidemic has been contained.
Is there someplace we could speak in private?
You said it yourself.
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
I'll do no such thing.
I'd like to earn some more money.
Stop talking and start listening.
Do you want to rent your house?
I am sure.
I want to thank everyone.
Tom taught Mary to read.
None of these are Tom's.
My high school French teacher wasn't a native speaker.
Both of my parents aren't alive.
She taught me so many interesting things.
Tom knows he's right.
That's the point.
Tom wouldn't let Mary keep it.
I got arrested.
This was a mistake.
They treat their employees well.
The picture is hung crooked.
We have a mutual friend.
Stay close.
What's your favorite radio station?
Let's meet the day after tomorrow.
You won't be interested.
He is watching my every move.
Please leave.
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
What were you doing down there?
Close the hatch.
Give me a couple minutes to get dressed.
She was very surprised at the news.
My hobby is music.
My impression of the United States is very good.
He always treats me like a child.
She raced him down the hill.
I have a sister and a brother.
Start a new paragraph here.
I think it's going to be a nice day.
I think you know that's not a good idea.
This handbag is mine.
Everyone hesitated.
Who'll be elected chairman?
I hope we have fine weather tomorrow.
We reached the station on time.
I opened the door.
We have the same group of friends.
My younger brother swims every day in the summer.
Let me handle it.
I love you.
I got acquainted with him last year.
This is bad.
Tom's sweating.
We've met a few times before.
Tom has been making too many mistakes.
Oh, that's a shame.
She advised him to go on a strict diet.
No one's around.
He's only a couple of years younger than me.
Teachers should never make fun of students who make mistakes.
I just don't like it.
He told his wife not to buy on impulse.
Did the umbrella that you found belong to Tom?
In those days, I went to bed earlier.
Of course I remember you.
Lightning struck his house.
Here we are.
This does not bode well.
She made him a new coat.
I'm sure you're going to like this.
That's very thoughtful of you.
Tom lost three sons in the war.
I'm not a liar.
Commit these words to memory.
That was everything I had.
What do you want for your birthday?
I had nothing to do with the accident.
Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
When he retired, his son took over his business.
I agree with you.
We'll finish later.
Tom is knitting a sweater.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
I got hurt while running.
Did you show it to your parents?
Who are you laughing at?
Aim the video camera at that group.
It's not easy.
No one will care.
He is enjoying his school life.
It was three years ago.
I got what you wanted.
Dust got into one of my eyes.
It would be a good idea if I went.
Does this have to be done now?
I'm starting to think we'll never be able to do this.
Tom sounds angry.
You're going to love this book.
Suddenly, 100 workers were laid off.
I just want to be loved.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
Tom still works at the same restaurant where Mary works.
I just don't want to talk to you.
Where did the accident happen?
Have you been told where to park your car?
To the Hilton Hotel, please.
I really miss my girlfriend.
She asked him out on a date.
She's my friend.
Why is it that you hate Tom so much?
Are you still up?
Don't move.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
She handed him his jacket then opened the door and asked him to leave.
He's gone into hiding.
You did that on your own, didn't you?
I dream of becoming a teacher.
He climbed the tree without difficulty.
I don't have your courage.
This is taking forever.
The conversation moved on to other topics.
I didn't do much work today.
This dog is yours.
It took me more than a month to get over my cold.
How did you get into this line of work?
They've been damaged.
I'm a graduate of Harvard.
Don't you want to help?
I gave him my phone number.
His curiosity knew no bounds.
Can you just tell me now, so I don't have to come back tomorrow?
I don't like going out by myself at night.
His office is very close to mine.
I'm fairly happy.
Are they tall?
This never gets old.
Which browser do you use?
All possible means have been tried.
That's totally irresponsible.
I was just messing around.
Don't carry more money than you need.
Don't anybody leave this room.
It is fun to swim in the sea.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
Could somebody give us a hand?
I don't remember exactly, but I suppose it was Friday last week.
Are you still studying French?
Forget it.
That hotel was very near the lake.
He saved a sailor.
You have beautiful hands.
I was last.
I had a busy morning.
Someone's talking.
I can't tell you how much your support means to us.
I can't exclude it.
Tom and I don't usually agree.
My mother cooks for me.
Would you like me to go there with you?
Be serious.
That's what you always do.
Is that enough?
I don't expect you'd remember.
I never worry.
I've broken my glasses.
Does this actually make you happy?
I hate the tie you're wearing.
I'm happy enough.
Everything hits the mark with him and he lets you know it.
I had to get all the facts before I could make a decision.
You won't have a choice.
Tom couldn't afford to buy the bicycle he wanted.
He used to drink.
I'm afraid I have to go now.
He can't do this kind of work, and she can't either.
This book will give you a clear idea of the American way of life.
Do you like this color?
How late do you stay open?
What are you celebrating?
Let's get serious.
If you push the button, the engine will stop.
I'll be right there.
Above all, logic requires precise definitions.
I used to think no one cared.
We had no alternative but to fight.
I have a friend waiting for me in the lobby.
I'm getting sleepy. I should've gone to bed earlier last night.
You aren't looking.
What are you doing here anyway?
I'm against the bill.
You and Tom are made to be together.
Tom spent time with Mary.
I thought you understood.
This one's still alive.
I dream a lot.
Malaria is a disease that mosquitoes carry.
I enjoy being a teacher.
Why isn't there any wine left in the bottle? Did you kids drink it?
You don't fall in love with somebody because he's perfect.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
I would like to improve my English pronunciation.
It's within walking distance.
We must cancel our trip to Japan.
I'd like to eat spaghetti.
This letter is for you.
He felt uneasy.
There is a mistake in this sentence.
Does that make you sad?
I need a tissue.
What time and where could we meet?
What do you want to be remembered for?
Cucumbers are related to watermelons.
Are you meeting someone here?
Have you ever seen Tokyo Tower?
Whose is this bicycle?
I want a lot.
Our ancestors developed massive jaws as a result of constant combat.
Have a look.
Eat something.
What do you do on Sundays?
We all work too hard.
I came here to meet you.
I figured you weren't coming.
I received your message yesterday.
I had a seizure.
We're quite alone.
It tastes just right.
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day.
We're looking for the treasure.
Death before dishonor!
I wish I earned more money.
I like milk.
We're useless.
I'm not living with him anymore.
He helped me do my homework.
We're in charge.
How did you answer Tom?
He had fifty dollars.
I get up around seven.
I had a nice chat with her.
You need to be careful.
He was absent from the meeting.
I'm tired of cleaning up after you.
I'm a good taxi driver.
May I ask you a question?
My friend remembered which way to go.
You're not dead yet.
Who did you go with?
That lady is over eighty.
Can you complete the job in two days?
There is strength in numbers.
My daughter is getting married in June.
They hate us.
The sun has set.
If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
I was born in 1988 in York.
I'm afraid I've got bad news.
You're horrible.
I don't want to leave you.
It was all done.
She pushed him out the window.
I suppose you've already bought a ticket.
She's about the same age as my sister.
May I go?
You look terrific.
Call Tom.
Are you willing to help?
Here are the tickets.
I'm sorry about last night.
That's not big enough.
Tom poured another drink.
How many did you take?
Tom was starting to feel a little uncomfortable.
Tom has lost both of his parents.
Tom has a muscular body.
The storm destroyed the whole town.
That dress matches her red hair.
That's a lot!
Can you put the children to bed?
It was a mess.
I handled it.
I think you are the one who broke it.
I can't understand the problem.
I am sorry that my friend is not here.
What time is sunset?
They'll kill you.
You'd better not go.
Cats can climb trees, but dogs can't.
Your questions were too direct.
Our only daughter died of cancer.
My mother happened to be there when the fire broke out.
I wonder if we can get in.
He has the habit of scratching his head.
Didn't you lock up your car?
Tom wants you to do him a favor.
The same thing happened in 2013.
I have nothing else worth saying.
Allow me to explain.
We listened to his lecture on the radio.
Concerning this, I'm the one to blame.
Their meeting was inevitable.
I collect silver tea spoons.
I have a grenade.
I'm learning French.
Tom wants me to apologize.
The pain she suffered while being tortured was unimaginable.
I just want to look at it, that's all.
We're not allowed to do that.
I've never seen a whale that big.
I had stuff to do.
He was afraid of the dark.
What are you drinking?
Tom was chosen among 300 applicants.
Although our universe is still young, theorists are busy exploring its ultimate fate.
What a bad movie!
What did you do with that book?
Is your sister married?
The only person who hasn't paid is you.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
My shoelaces came undone.
He will come this afternoon.
If it rains tomorrow, we'll stay at home.
Let's continue where we left off yesterday.
I pretended to work.
He came in spite of the heavy snow.
I asked the boy to throw the ball back.
Please remove your shoes before entering the house.
Once you've formed a bad habit, you can't get rid of it easily.
Do you need an ambulance?
What they wanted was a man like himself.
Tom thinks I'm going to drink this, but I'm not.
There's no such thing as luck.
The movie we saw last night was filmed in Australia.
No one speaks that language anymore.
Where can we park?
You should wash fruit before you eat it.
She always acts politely toward everybody.
Why did you come here today?
I don't know who that man is.
Show me your passport, please.
They're my friends.
I liked walking alone on the deserted beach.
Zoology and botany deal with the study of life.
My house is near the station.
Here's a photo of her.
Why didn't you apply for the job?
Let go of the rope.
Are you vegetarian?
I dance in my living room all the time.
What fell on me?
My remarks were not aimed at you.
I want to live forever.
I would rather not go.
She asked him to call her later.
We have something very important that we have to discuss.
We kept in touch.
This isn't legal.
Stand up and introduce yourself, please.
A home is more than a mere building.
Let me bring you up to speed.
You can invite any person you like.
I love your eyes.
They talk all the time.
I left my calculator on my desk.
They caught Tom.
Where do you think we came from?
I felt very happy.
I don't have any money.
This afternoon the weather is going to get worse.
I appreciate the sentiment.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
Tom asked Mary to read the letter.
We're a big family.
We're moving.
Tom has passed out.
Where is the exit?
There's no toilet paper.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
Where are they going?
I am more beautiful than you.
I'm always surprised by him.
I don't believe that for one moment.
There's always more to learn.
She is forbidden to go out.
He wants one.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
I don't play tennis after school.
No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it.
I sleep six hours a day on average.
Throw another log on the fire, will you?
Have you heard of me?
There's somebody coming up the stairs.
The local coffee shop was replaced by a Starbucks.
She'll probably come.
I was angry at myself.
Tom disappeared.
As soon as I find it, I'll bring it over to your place.
Can you play the guitar? "Yes, I can."
It feels weird not working.
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
He turned his attention to the picture.
These cars are made in Japan.
The door was closed.
You're the oldest.
He let us go.
You're under investigation.
I was very happy when I heard that news.
I got a flat tire.
Your book is here.
Stop being so naive.
I'm not a thief.
Where is my seat?
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I brought you some water.
Is it yours?
We all know how this is going to end.
I thought they wouldn't come.
My sister has long legs.
Tom wouldn't take my call.
I think it's time for me to get a new job.
She left her ticket at home.
Let's take a short break.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
Her slurred speech was an indication that she was drunk.
We have other things to do.
That's what I'd try to do.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
He has a foreign car.
You have lots of phones.
But his name is slightly familiar to me.
Maybe we should call the whole thing off.
Thank you for inviting me to dinner.
Somebody's going to notice you.
Is Tom a good kisser?
We met at summer camp.
They grow strawberries in their greenhouse.
May all your dreams come true!
Don't take it so personally.
I don't think Tom will come back.
Tom and Mary told me they had a good time at the concert.
You don't scare me anymore.
Don't scream, or I'll scream louder.
I don't feel so smart.
You're too skinny.
A crazy thing just happened to me.
One of your neighbors complained.
I get depressed at times.
I no longer need a loan.
Let's just say no.
I don't know what I was expecting.
The houses are burning.
Does she like chocolate?
I don't expect you to understand it.
Which of you will come with me?
I thought the little boy who was staring and pointing at the foreigner was very rude.
Press the bell twice.
What makes you think you won't be able to do it?
What could go wrong?
I am quite all right now.
I love your place.
I usually eat out.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
You've been warned.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Tom really cares about you.
Tom makes things very easy for me.
Let me give you a hug.
Goodbye. I'll see you at the time we agreed on.
The series of crimes were thought to have been committed by the same man.
Enjoy your day.
Would you be willing to help?
You aren't in a hurry, are you?
He failed the exam.
Sometimes I go by bus and sometimes by car.
She couldn't convince him to accept a personal check.
For my part, I have no objection.
How far is it from here to your school?
I forgot your number.
I excused myself for a minute.
Cut the power off.
They are the ones who want to go.
Cars arrived there one after another.
The escaped prisoners are still on the run.
We asked everybody the same question.
Do you want me to help you with your homework?
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
He has any number of books.
Tom wanted Mary to take care of his kids.
That's old news.
I know Tom is a light eater.
Have you heard this story already?
That's all I can offer you.
I'm reluctant to help Tom.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Are you sure you don't want one?
The water was blue.
He's a movie buff.
He has written two books.
I thought Tom was at school.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
Can you get by on your wages?
Haven't you caused enough trouble already?
I feel very betrayed.
That man didn't give me his name.
The amount of time you spend practicing the trumpet is up to you.
Did I ruin your plans?
Please don't tell anyone I was here.
Do you remember me?
It's possible.
This isn't surprising at all.
Which air conditioner do you think is the most efficient?
You shouldn't worry about that.
I'm a tourist.
The cat sat on the mat.
You're really annoying.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I'm sure Tom will leave early.
I can't believe he kissed you.
She feels at ease in their home.
It's you who doesn't understand.
I bet you're hungry.
Don't let them get you down.
That's not really necessary anymore.
It's popular with students.
I will walk.
Tom almost never eats fruit.
I am just a humble teacher.
I know that Tom is boring.
Tom intends to become a journalist.
You must be very busy these days.
Is it made of wood or metal?
They may leave tomorrow.
Kyoto has many universities.
I cannot speak German.
Oil and water won't blend with each other.
That boy denies stealing the bicycle.
Please bring it back tomorrow.
We could've made a fortune.
What vegetables do you usually grow?
Tom writes well.
Why would anybody eat pickled cabbage?
I can't believe you.
There was music.
She was always telephoning me.
I arrived at school on time.
The bat was stolen yesterday, along with the balls.
I wouldn't care.
I figured you must be hungry by now.
He lives in an enormous house.
Tom handed Mary a mug of coffee.
I know Tom was hesitant to do that.
Tom doesn't love his wife.
This seems too good to be true.
I don't want to miss the bus.
I don't have time to argue with you.
I just want to thank you for all your help.
I'm in bed.
This is no accident.
Tom wasn't allowed to see his father.
Lend me as much money you can.
I don't feel like eating.
Tell me you're kidding.
That's why I came.
They're twins.
Everything is connected.
Will you look after my baggage?
Will the work be finished by tomorrow?
I have no idea what that could be.
Stay in bed.
I didn't know you had a sister.
Had I known your telephone number, I would have called you.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Of course, I knew it was dangerous.
I'll have my revenge.
I like speaking French.
Tom was a little disoriented.
I had already heard that song once.
At what time did you hear the gunshot?
She is busy learning English.
You're not a suspect.
You can always depend upon her to help.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Who did Tom plan on going to Australia with?
I've never seen a rainbow.
She is young.
Would you like to get something to eat? It's on me.
I wouldn't care.
He likes swimming in the summer.
Why did you come?
Get a job so you can support your wife and kids.
That never used to bother me.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
I asked Tom if he knew anybody who taught French.
The joke's on us.
My dad thinks my boyfriend is a real whack job.
We should all stick together.
The teacher lined the children up in order of height.
I can't explain it right now.
The letter was wrongly addressed.
I'll bring sandwiches.
Says who? "Says me."
She devoted her time to the study of music.
Tom doesn't know anything about it.
Tom didn't even try to get up.
Look it up in your dictionary.
My home is your home.
DNA tests showed he was innocent.
Do you want some help?
Oh, don't be like that.
I'm going to hide somewhere near here.
There are more clouds today than yesterday.
You and I aren't like that.
I'm just a little dizzy.
This is the right answer.
I know you're hiding something.
Tom doesn't like my friends.
I strongly suggest that you study harder.
I don't like to sing in public.
We ran a hundred-meter dash.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I'd like to ask you some questions now.
I mistook him for my brother.
I memorized the poem.
I tried to get good marks.
This ink is the best.
The commission concluded that the answer was no.
How much thinner do you want to be?
I just emailed you.
Two doctors were talking shop.
That boy looks like Tom.
Somebody has left his hat.
What's the matter? Just tell me.
We'll have to do this quickly.
Step on the scale.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
I'm not leaving the two of you alone.
I make you nervous, don't I?
Where's the knife?
I don't know how to thank you.
It's not going to be that easy.
Tom asked the stranger who he was.
Flowers attract bees.
We have to stay together.
This isn't good for Tom.
I just want to make Tom happy.
Could you move the chair a bit?
Even if he does something bad, he'll never admit it.
This offer is good for five days.
Tom is afraid of me, isn't he?
I've finished watering the flowers.
It is impossible to put the plan into practice.
It was colder yesterday than today.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
You don't know what this is, do you?
You won't be shot.
He arrived after I had left.
Are you all nuts?
This doesn't fit.
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
Are you surprised?
You're very sophisticated.
It's not what you do, but how you do it that matters.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
That's not such a bad idea.
I'll take a look at it.
He no longer lives here.
I am not happy.
Take it, or leave it.
I'm really disappointed in you, Tom.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Last year, I couldn't spend as much time with my children as I wanted to.
I do love you.
Do your homework right now.
It won't be hard.
It was so dark that I couldn't see anything.
Just looking at a picture of food makes me feel nauseous.
Get me something to eat.
Let's not talk about Tom.
What trouble can he cause?
I'm feeling much better today.
I'm too tired to go out jogging.
I want you to go.
When was it built?
Are you lonely?
I need some advice.
If I were to tell you all I know, you would be amazed.
You must come.
Some juice, please.
The upstairs window opened.
I'm starving!
Would you give me a break?
That doesn't bother me.
He was angry with his daughter.
I'm not ready yet.
Fried food usually doesn't agree with me.
I slept nine hours.
What's there to do?
I asked my mother to wake me up at four.
If you have questions, don't hesitate to jump in.
Autumn is almost here.
He borrowed the car from his friend.
He was eager to return to school in September.
I drive everywhere.
The train is always on time.
Chinese characters are difficult to read.
I don't feel that guilty.
I heard an unusual noise.
You left your lights on.
I'd die without you.
I hope you've got some proof to back up your allegations.
I thought I was your best friend.
Do you think you'll stay long?
I'll introduce you.
It was here that I saw her.
I'm happy that it's over.
When did you begin to learn English?
I'd be delighted.
Is that what the government wants?
Our committee consists of ten members.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
Don't read my diary.
You remind me of your brother.
Will you stay here for a while?
We're already old.
You have to see it.
I'm not done yet.
Wake up, Tom.
This car is mine.
Tom was wearing a bulletproof vest, so the bullet didn't kill him.
I still can't afford to do that.
I was about to call you.
Tom hardly ever wears a tie.
There are no clean plates.
I thought I was being smart.
You can't go out dressed like that.
Did you finish your paper?
You're rich.
Is my answer correct?
How could I lie to you?
I know you'll do what needs to be done.
I want you all to be very careful.
Tom's reaction was the opposite of what Mary had expected.
My neighbor renovated her house completely.
I'm pleased with my new bathing suit.
I made photocopies.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
You don't look comfortable.
We've done it all.
Are you happy with your weight?
He had an accident and fractured his leg.
You must not touch the paintings.
Please put a lot of cream in my coffee.
We want one.
I'm not free to go this afternoon.
You're in danger.
I stole a gun.
They were all scared.
I'll go to Tom's place tomorrow.
I told you I didn't do it.
Tom turned off his headlights.
I'm just tired.
I'll always be there for you.
I want it to be different this time.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
Where do we get the textbooks?
This cheese is the best I've ever tasted.
I don't want to participate in the ceremony.
The monkey came down.
Please don't waste water.
Don't ask any questions.
Christmas is soon, isn't it?
I want to study English.
Do you remember me?
You look a little pale.
This book is not available in Japan.
You can't change the past.
I wish I had wings to fly.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
I don't know why I bother repeating myself.
Don't let me influence you.
We just fed the baby.
She was the first one to notice him.
We'll have a lot of fun.
What is it called?
Go to your room.
I don't have a good feeling about this.
They're dancing.
Did you enjoy the game?
Why are you two always fighting?
They're still young.
Everybody needs something to believe in.
I need more information on this matter.
Don't forget to spend a little time looking over your notes before the exam.
Please close the door.
Do we have insurance?
Our train went through a long tunnel.
Is anybody ready for dessert?
Tom's cooking.
The barn is full of hay.
Is that a problem?
The report is being prepared by the committee.
We should ask Tom what he thinks we should do.
I want you to help me this afternoon.
I wouldn't tell Tom about that if I were you.
I think you need to see him.
What were we supposed to do?
Are you sure about the cost of that car?
He shot at the bird, but missed it.
This ticket is valid for three days.
They've done it before.
Tom spent his birthday in solitary confinement.
What relieves the pain?
The boy is wearing glasses.
Who are those guys?
I get depressed by the slightest things.
Tom and Mary usually speak French to each other.
I don't mind if I get wet.
I translate articles almost every day.
I'm three years younger than you.
They are watching a movie.
I was flat on my back for a week with a terrible cold.
It took him a long time to take in what she was saying.
There are two zeros in the number "2010."
Don't let anything stand between you and success.
They did not have enough gold.
I know you're innocent.
Do you want something cold to drink?
Don't give me that look.
How important are children to you?
Business failures are down 10% this year.
I know Tom is a gardener.
Tom refused to listen to Mary.
What's your favorite wine?
It's quite a simple idea.
I got up to go and look outside.
If it doesn't exist, create it.
Where did you put your key?
You always ask too many questions.
It fell short of my expectation.
This movie was very interesting.
We ought to be ready for whatever comes.
We must have faith in the president.
The train is 10 minutes late today.
My wife is a good manager.
Would you please quit asking me that?
Can you watch the kids?
Things are only going to get worse.
It's going to be cool this weekend.
This dictionary is my sister's.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
He hasn't done anything.
Tom wants to go with you.
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
Tom should never have to do that.
We walked to my room.
Can you introduce me to your friend?
As soon as I can get the chance, I'll send you some money.
The market is completely saturated.
There weren't many boys at the picnic.
We were lucky.
I'm assuming this is your father.
I stayed at home because I was sick.
Don't hesitate to ask if you want anything.
You're not going to want to miss this.
He is fresh from college.
The sisters are quite alike.
How did you find me?
I think you're a liar.
The lavishness of the party amazed everybody.
Can you recommend a good restaurant for dinner?
That's pretty much all you need to know.
A few of these are mine.
She demanded to see the manager.
Do you enjoy losing?
When do you go on holiday?
Is my answer correct?
I just want you to listen.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
Tom is a great actor.
Hurry up, girls.
Tom is someone I really enjoy hanging out with.
I can't make that decision for you.
Tom deserves a vacation.
You're to blame.
I think you should stop giving Tom money.
The Zulu tribe in South Africa has its own language.
Someone has stolen all my money.
I'm shorter than you.
I know Tom is a good chef.
I didn't see anything strange.
Can you leave the light on?
I want to start now.
What do you think of these shoes?
Whatever you say.
She has something in her hand.
Don't look so shocked.
He did not speak unless spoken to.
I got over that.
We were both very tired.
I've done nothing wrong.
Have you tried online dating?
It looks like the thief came in through the window.
The two of them are in the room.
I can't think of anything to write about.
I went to the mall with my friends.
I prefer to go alone.
Tom might be able to fix that.
I did the same thing in Boston.
Tom looks extremely happy.
I'm not cut out to be a politician.
I don't want him to touch me.
I know the house where he was born.
Why don't you play the banjo anymore?
Tom finished.
Tom didn't have to get up so early.
I never really wanted to study French.
Tom watched closely.
Aren't you cold?
Tom was the one who taught me how to sing country music.
It is utterly impossible to finish the work within a month.
Could you please bring me a clean knife?
Valentine's Day is on Sunday this year.
I want you to listen carefully.
I don't need a history lesson.
I chickened out.
The price of these shoes has been reduced.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
Please put your baggage on this scale.
How do you feel about the issue?
Tom looked out of the window.
My cat is going to have kittens next month.
It is getting darker and darker.
Tom takes himself too seriously.
Please find a solution to the problem.
The enemy is becoming more and more powerful.
Remove the bandage.
She's not my type.
We must leave.
I'm just killing time.
Tom looked back.
In 1943, Japan was at war.
He was too tired to study.
They didn't want me to examine it.
What would you like to do today?
I walked my dog.
The first round is on the house.
Why is it that you are always late?
Everyone says that he's a good man.
He has gone to Hokkaido.
I felt the house shake.
I talked to Tom and he's OK.
You're safe.
I'd like to put on some clothes.
Tom is very organized, isn't he?
She told me that she had bigger fish to fry.
He doesn't like oranges.
What train you are going to take?
I have to part with my old furniture.
What happened at the beach?
I've never dated anyone taller than me.
Don't say a word to anyone.
We'll use the house as collateral so we can borrow some money.
You were terrified, weren't you?
Even Tom is a little surprised.
I was searching for food.
I had no sooner closed the door than somebody started knocking on it.
You're always complaining.
I don't like feeling so powerless.
Do you think I should go by myself?
Tokyo is the capital of Japan.
It is useless to talk to him.
Guess what I did last night.
What a wonderful idea!
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
I had the exact same feeling.
What could possibly go wrong?
They're asleep.
What happened to all those people?
We can't be more specific.
I don't play that game.
I want to see what I'm up against.
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
When the bell rang, the teacher ended the class.
My sister has a job.
I think God is a woman.
She closed her diary slowly.
I've never heard of you.
I have a right to be on this ship.
My house burned down.
I'm too tired to argue.
I didn't know you were such a good cook.
I don't care what you think.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to need some help.
They elected him chairman.
Please write down what I say.
She is no ordinary singer.
I'll meet you there in an hour.
Beat it.
Do you know that boy who's crying?
It wasn't much of a plan.
The sky turned dark.
I don't have to study tonight. I think I'll watch television for a while.
I admire Tom's perseverance.
You should help your father.
Don't waste your time trying to help Tom.
What a jerk!
I dropped by just to say hello.
What're you doing in this park?
Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything.
Tom is getting better.
You get out only what you put in.
I fell in love with someone my parents didn't like.
I really have a problem.
You're part of the problem.
Get me another lawyer.
You have to be here at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
You can smoke in this room.
That movie was a real tearjerker.
This isn't the right way to do this.
He is sometimes absent from school.
How about eating out with me?
Do you want to see more?
He can't go without wine for even a day.
I saw him looking at me.
The girl doesn't like to play soccer.
I want you to do this.
I don't have a tattoo.
I will have finished the work by noon.
I can look at it when you're ready.
What should I do? I said to myself.
He often takes me for a drive.
Do you like black cats?
Just keep moving.
Can I see you for a moment?
I must've been dreaming.
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
I thought I'd never see you again.
Don't eat the oysters.
I like puzzles.
We need to think together about the future of Europe.
The police arrested the suspect.
I can't stand this hot weather.
I did that very carefully.
You will soon get accustomed to your new school.
He comes here twice a week.
You can call me at any time you like.
What else would you like to eat?
Why don't you stop?
He is always reading.
In case I forget, please remind me.
Have you fixed the thermostat?
You'll never be alone.
Tom must've been home at that time.
I think we could help each other.
Beware of the dog!
Tom caught the ball with his left hand.
They gave it to me.
Would you like to come?
You're going to regret this.
That's not easy to do.
It began to rain cats and dogs.
Please tell us what it is.
Be sure to turn out the light when you go out.
I was thrown off guard.
I'm not so convinced.
I have no time.
Tom looked a bit puzzled.
I have a dishwasher.
Don't you think that's strange?
Bring the frozen fish here.
Kyoto gets thousands of visitors from all over the world each year.
Could you call again later, please?
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
The frogs' croaking helped me fall asleep.
Do you like salmon?
I would like to buy some aspirin.
I'm still not sure.
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
Is this typewriter yours?
She turned off the lights.
I don't have any further details.
I'd love to come back next week.
That would be hard.
Tom and Mary have always been friends.
This changes nothing.
What's it all about?
She is related to him.
Did I make the team?
After dinner, bring your guitar along and we'll sing.
Believe it or not, I can actually draw.
Could you speak a little louder please?
Are you mad about something?
I strongly advise you to take this medicine right away.
What is going on here?
I had my hat blown off by the wind.
Tom reminds me of my first husband.
I'm not going to tell you my name.
They make a great team.
Be kind to little animals.
Instant noodles are a staple among college students.
He robbed me of every cent I had.
We're kind of busy here.
Though the doctor did his best, the patient's recovery was slow.
I believe you know what I mean.
What's the meaning of life?
I appreciate what you are trying to do.
This report is well written.
Go and wake Mary up.
We should cancel the hike.
We need to talk.
Tom isn't ready to leave.
Please be kind to others.
I was absolutely stunned.
Fill the bucket with water.
I've actually heard of this.
Tom betrayed his own brother.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
I washed it.
Everybody congratulated Tom.
I took advantage of a sale and bought three sweaters.
How can I make you understand?
Let him go!
What was her answer to your proposal?
Tom and Mary are the only survivors.
My brother is an idiot.
He is to blame for the failure.
He would not raise my salary.
I lost my camera.
Please do not try this at home.
I've been very impressed.
She was accused of lying.
I thought it was illegal to park here.
I don't get along with my neighbors.
This idea is controversial.
Were you really angry?
The next station is where you get off.
I fell off the ladder.
Tom got drunk last night.
We are still clinging to the dreams of our youth.
I hope you have insurance.
Both girls laughed.
I play volleyball a lot.
I thought we could get together later.
He is anxious to go to America.
Do you think he will come? "I hope not."
Will you listen to me for a few minutes?
Don't be too hard on me.
He threatened me, but I wasn't scared.
Tom is worried about that, isn't he?
I try to travel with only one suitcase.
Proceed with caution.
Do you have anything to say in particular?
You didn't finish filling out this form.
I actually enjoyed that.
I'm only telling the truth.
I'm reading a book about skiing.
My sister takes a shower every morning.
How long has it been since your divorce?
Hundreds of unemployed men sleep there day and night.
How are you all?
You wouldn't be able to handle the pressure.
You don't know the truth.
Is that all right with you?
That's the only way to do it.
Did you turn off the gas?
How long are they?
Was I seen leaving?
You dropped your handkerchief.
Who are you trying to convince?
Everyone has faults.
I thought you already had one.
Tom was probably drunk when he did that.
Get my rifle.
They agreed to start early.
I've heard rumors about you and Tom.
What am I supposed to do with them?
Why did you turn off the TV?
My house is only five minutes' walk from the station.
Our ancestors came to this country 150 years ago.
That problem naturally invited discussion.
What do you do for a living?
Come join us.
Rules are important for everyone.
You're a good liar.
Why don't we take the subway?
Spit it out, Tom.
We're not late.
Do you want a car?
I know what this is about.
Take that box away!
I'm not completely naive.
When did you take this picture?
How many books are there on the table?
What have you eaten today?
He is known as a great painter.
Tom trusts you.
Please correct my pronunciation.
She's one tough cookie.
He is the only American to have swum the English Channel.
I have seen that girl before.
You've done a terrific job.
I just got your message.
Can I sleep here?
He had a copy made of this key.
Astronomy is an expensive hobby.
I was out of town on vacation.
It never gets old.
We're different.
How much further do we have to go?
Tom forgot to pay his rent.
I've heard it said that you should never marry your first love.
It's easy for her to make friends.
I can't wait for spring to come so we can sit under the cherry trees.
Tom is dreaming again.
Whatever he may say, I won't change my mind.
If you are hungry, you can eat the bread.
We don't have a plan.
Can you call him?
He pretended to be my friend.
He prefers not to talk about it.
This is a friend of mine.
That looks like blood.
How are things coming along?
Mary slipped off her robe and got into the shower.
We're all wasting time.
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
You must be cautious.
Don't lose sleep over that.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I never heard from him again.
Dry wood burns quickly.
You must be blind as a bat if you couldn't see it.
I figured it out by myself.
The outside of the castle was painted white.
A fire broke out on the fifth floor.
I don't want to resign my job at present.
It took some 150 years of struggling for women to gain the freedom they have today.
It's not worth the money.
I'm afraid for his life.
He held his breath.
Who ate all the pies?
He came downstairs.
I think we should sell our old car.
That's the law.
He's in good physical condition.
Are you a criminal?
They have come.
We're just starting.
Could you please tell me why you love her?
Is it that hard?
They loaded the truck.
I got hammered last night.
What was wrong with them?
I finally caught up with my friends.
I get asked that question a lot.
Am I the only one that doesn't agree with you?
Do I have to do this now?
I got this as a wedding gift, but I've never used it.
What will you do?
He has friends from many different walks of life.
Which is your favorite team?
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
We're separated.
We could ask Tom what he thinks.
I didn't know about it.
Speaking of hobbies, I'm fond of baseball.
It's even worse than it looks.
You have the right to free speech, but not the right to slander.
It's no use trying to keep secrets from journalists.
She left her children behind.
Is her story true?
He is too smart not to know it.
Which platform is it on?
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
She was eager to go home.
Are you growing a beard?
If I eat too much chocolate, I break out in pimples.
Tom tried to conceal the truth.
She is obstinate.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
I know both of them.
This problem is difficult for me to solve.
Let's see if Tom can help us.
All of them will get a prize.
Tom was at Mary's baptism.
I won't tell if you won't.
Your question is hard for me to answer.
Just say yes.
I am going in the same direction. Come with me. I will take you there.
Can you please do this for me?
Finding work is difficult.
He told me to meet him at his house.
I found it necessary to get a loan.
I don't care who you are.
He was anxious to meet you.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
I'd like your permission to use it.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
It's very cold.
You must be more polite.
He walked across the street.
They are looking to you for help.
I was ill yesterday.
There isn't much wind today.
Accidents often result from carelessness.
I've read all about you.
She stood up.
Are there any apples on the tree?
Let's sit on the bench.
I only quit because you asked me to.
I like listening to good music.
I just changed my password.
There's the rub.
Never rub your eyes after cutting a hot pepper.
Our ultimate goal is to establish world peace.
Do you like music?
Stay in the house.
I oiled my bicycle.
I know the photographer who took this picture.
Do you think you could be a cop?
I've had a really weird day.
It did not come off.
It was all a big lie.
I'm completely exhausted.
We're just nervous.
I can't go back there and neither can you.
Tom asked Mary if she loved him.
A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him round.
He's out of position.
He committed suicide by taking poison.
Try not to think about it.
The doors were closed.
The witch hunt has begun.
No one welcomed the proposal.
I thought you'd want to take a look.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
I beg you.
He was too embarrassed to do it.
He shook his son by the shoulder.
He did not know what to say.
I didn't know that I had to do that.
He has guts.
They're in trouble.
Never hesitate to tell the truth.
You were late, weren't you?
Let's do this properly.
Why did he come here?
Why don't you let me take a look?
Get me the evidence.
They kept singing until a rescue team came.
I wish I were a bird.
Did you make up your mind?
What languages do they speak in Belgium?
When I got home, I had a nice, ice-cold shower.
This can't possibly go wrong.
Do you enjoy talking?
She found it dull living in the country.
The mayor addressed the general public.
He is about my age.
I owe you a lot.
I have no friends.
I will act on your advice.
I don't usually have to work on Sundays.
Every time I read this book, I discover something new.
You're resilient.
He told me to meet him at his apartment.
I'm ready to leave this place.
I'm on my way.
We don't have enough beer.
Is everyone here?
He owes his wealth to good luck.
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
The explorers finally reached their goal.
The seats are all sold out.
My wife is always complaining about something.
Be respectful.
I was just in time for the last train.
They all cheated.
You're both pretty.
Go jump in the lake.
Hello! Fancy meeting you here! It's a small world, isn't it?
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
Tom took Mary to the hospital.
I really do need your help.
They admitted her to the hospital.
They hope their delivery truck will be repaired by the end of the week.
What did you write?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
She gave birth to twins a week ago.
It's not their fault.
Don't you want to meet Tom?
She said she would be back soon.
Those pens are mine.
Tom told Mary that he thought John was innocent.
Wait for your turn, please.
There is nothing the matter with the motor.
You must be cautious.
He is the older of the two.
He jumped over a ditch.
It is out of fashion.
This is a time of year when people get together with family and friends to observe Passover and to celebrate Easter.
Did you think I was Canadian?
Tom hoped that the doctors would tell him that he didn't need the surgery after all.
You shouldn't eat any fish that come from this river.
I know Tom is usually punctual.
That's not very funny.
I won't buy one.
I never drink coffee.
I prefer to be alone.
I was waiting for that question.
The pain is agonizing.
Let's not argue anymore.
I was born the year the war ended.
I don't want to eat anything.
I have a previous engagement at ten.
Just do your best.
He was tricked into doing it.
She asked me how many languages I spoke.
There were no other survivors.
Could you give me some examples?
I know your problem.
Do you want to give it another try?
The table in that room is very nice.
He was learning a poem.
Are you good at mathematics?
You don't look like your dad.
Tom seemed very impressed.
I think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.
Get ready for bed.
You're being malicious.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
Who's watching?
A white car has been tailing me for the last two miles.
I don't want to live my life like this.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
It looked like a gun.
How will we pay our debts now?
Are you happy doing that?
How do you know where to go?
Tom is insecure.
He ran outside naked.
That doesn't cut the mustard.
I'm behind schedule.
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
The roof is on fire.
This yogurt tastes strange.
I saw you there.
She forgave him.
I looked at myself in the mirror.
There are no other options.
Don't eat the oysters.
I am going on a picnic tomorrow.
You're just different.
This old book is worth 50,000 yen.
Let's not panic over this.
What would you like to eat?
Do turtles have teeth?
Tom and Mary don't know what's happening.
Many flights were canceled because of the typhoon.
How could you not know?
Tom just told his wife that he was leaving her.
The day is almost over.
Shut that door.
You're a good guitarist. "I'd like to think I am."
Get down.
Tom's advice was very helpful.
Are you off your rocker?
I received a letter from my sister.
They might be taller than you.
That's not your knife.
This sounds about right.
You're crazy.
A bad cold has kept me from studying this week.
We're astonished.
Tom is poor, but he's happy.
Why did you leave your last job?
Does she have a piano?
Let me introduce you to the rest of the team.
Spring has come.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
How do you deal with it?
I want you to come somewhere with me.
Shut the door, please.
You gotta get more organized.
It's on my desk.
I can't believe you're here.
I'll be in the bar drinking beer.
Let's park the car here and walk the rest of the way.
Tom and Mary were playing on the seesaw.
We are happy.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I like this song.
I don't sleep anymore.
I'm very proud of our students.
Tom tossed the ball to Mary.
I know that Japanese songs are very difficult for us.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I don't know how much time we have.
This sentence is not in English.
There is no going back.
I decided not to eat.
The store is open from nine to six.
He looked young beside his brother.
What do you think is in the box?
I don't know how deep the lake is.
Are you going to write to your father?
We don't have much in common.
This is the unforgettable place where we met each other for the first time.
He has no children.
Would you care for more cookies?
He asked me who I was.
I don't really like horses.
He will defeat them.
Aren't you the only one who has a key to this door?
I had to get out of the house.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
There have been a lot of complaints from consumers that our products don't last as long as we claim.
Maybe that's not such a good idea.
How long does it last?
I'd like to go back to the office.
She has very few close friends.
Tom said he had a lot of money.
How do you happen to know Tom?
The bike's mine.
Tom ruined my life.
You need to be careful.
She advised him to come back at once.
At last, they met face to face.
That woman has wrongly accused me.
I'm going to try to get a good tan.
You're always complaining.
I'll take care of the bill.
I've already spent all my pocket money for this month.
Some people like coffee and others prefer tea.
I only have one so far.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
Who owns this house?
It rained so hard that the shrine was washed away.
Grandpa always said there'd be days like this.
I don't like your suggestion.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Everybody's happy.
Are you crying?
I just want to get it over with.
I've never even had a girlfriend.
Can you please close that window?
He had an accident and fractured his leg.
The first season of the year is spring.
What are you called?
The thieves divvied up the proceeds from their heist.
With the T.V. on, how can you keep your mind on your studies?
Didn't you feel like going?
I thought you'd left.
I don't have any trouble believing that.
He arrived late as usual.
I want to talk to you about this report.
We did everything we could.
I refuse to answer.
What happened next?
She turned on the TV.
Here's the translation.
We're just scared.
Japan has caught up with Europe and America in medicine.
He wants to marry my daughter.
I'm perfectly happy.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
She went into the room and lay on the bed.
That happened over a year ago.
We need to buy a new rug for this room.
I have to find that.
Which beach do you like to go to?
I love it when that happens.
A man's worth lies not in what he has but in what he is.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Did you come here by yourself?
Do you have any questions?
He failed the exam.
You are old enough to take care of yourself.
I'm not listening.
Are you still scared?
Do you want me to bring my guitar?
Luck plays an important part in life.
Nobody can hear you.
I love hanging out with you.
He went to Austria for the purpose of studying music.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
My internet connection is slow.
Next year will be worse.
That's what I expected it to be like.
I'm behind him.
Please keep your cynical remarks to yourself.
Where's the pharmacy?
I'm not allowed to do that either.
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
She is practicing the violin now.
He's on his last legs.
I believe you like your job.
She intended to go shopping with her mother, but her mother was busy.
He explained to me how to use the machine.
We'll swim tomorrow.
Thirteen homes have been destroyed.
I'll send someone up to help you now.
I can't go to the gym tonight.
Please stop talking.
How long are you going to stay in Boston?
Tom asked if you'd be there.
The traffic accident prevented me from catching the train.
I just don't want to lose you.
This is one of the most influential novels of the past 30 years.
I didn't know you were so tired.
I'll call the cops.
Today is a holiday.
He wouldn't let anyone interfere in his personal affairs.
That's what I expected from Tom.
Are you wearing a wire?
I think you did very well.
Tom forgot the keys on the table.
He told her that he loved her.
I can't make you any promises.
Keep singing.
Tom wasn't sure.
You came at just the right time.
You will never be too old to learn.
You are a student.
How do you know all that?
Give me an example.
We are even.
I have a ten-year-old boy.
I am exhausted.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
You are a bit fat.
The children shared a pizza after school.
That's what I told them.
Are you better now?
I honestly don't care.
Be nicer to your brother.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
I'm glad he liked it.
Are you speaking English?
She met him for breakfast.
I like the color of your lipstick.
He took the first prize.
He belongs to our tennis team.
Everyone wants something.
He traveled around the country.
I fail to see what's so amusing.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
Do you know a better way to do this?
You are tired, aren't you?
My husband and I are both teachers.
All of my children go to school in Boston.
I'm glad for this opportunity to work with you.
My friend is beside me.
I appreciate your situation.
Tom tried to sleep.
I think we all know what's happening.
You're doing an excellent job.
It was raining.
Are they taking care of you?
I don't read as much as I'd like.
There's no guarantee that the stock will go up.
Is there anything I should know about?
I can't find the salt shaker.
Great, isn't it?
Are you young?
I'm sure you don't want to do that.
Let me hear it.
Tom found it very difficult to breathe.
I can't figure out anything.
I have another question.
French is one of the languages I've always wanted to learn.
Say hello to your friends.
Do you know anyone who's not on Facebook?
I am eighteen years old.
She baked me a cake.
You need to sit down and rest.
You have to trust me on this.
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
How many men do you have?
I need to finish my homework.
You're not dressed.
Weddings are expensive.
He bought a hat.
He gave a speech.
That's how I like it.
I want you to find out.
We've all read that one.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
What do you want to know?
Do you want to try this?
My father works hard because he wants to give us everything we need.
Everybody is busy except me.
That's not my name.
You look like a lawyer.
You can listen to audio files by native speakers on our website.
Let me go and buy some bread.
I don't know where we'll live next year.
I was caught in a shower on my way home from school.
I feel good.
She gave me access to her records.
His way of speaking annoys me.
My parents made me go there.
How can you concentrate?
Everyone who knew him admired him.
That sounded like a gunshot.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
It was just the beginning.
Let's list all the reasons we shouldn't do that.
Tom seems to be sympathetic.
I didn't expect to see you at a place like this.
Please don't waste water.
What do Italians usually eat for lunch?
I think I caught your cold.
I was afraid that you'd say that.
It's worse than I thought.
Have you ever had a serious illness?
What does PTA stand for?
The South Pole is a lot colder than the North Pole.
It's all over for us.
We have yet to discover an effective remedy for cancer.
We asked him what he was called.
That's undeniable.
The old man wanders from town to town peddling his wares.
I'll be watching you.
Look at the girls.
I've removed the comma.
Tom has three cars.
Drink up your milk.
I know you're busy, too.
It's bound to be better next time.
I appreciate the invitation.
Tom doesn't want to get married until he's in his thirties.
Who is your English teacher?
I want to do it for you.
Are you on drugs or something?
Please help yourself to the chocolate cake.
There's nothing more to say.
Attach labels to all the bags.
He did what he promised to do.
I have enough money to buy it.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
Stop playing hard to get.
All the members were present.
He doesn't earn enough money to live on.
Why don't you admit your mistake?
There is no chance of rain today.
He is making cookies.
I suggest you leave.
They are not sisters.
I shouldn't have asked you that.
Do you love each other very much?
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
I don't like any of these pictures.
He lives near my house.
He's not at all afraid of snakes.
She often goes to the movies with him.
I do believe you.
I didn't get any of that.
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
Do you want me to paint you?
He would like to take part in the competition.
No one has ever said such things to me.
That's perfect.
I think you ought to get a little sleep.
Stop spending money on stupid things.
He never gave in to temptation.
You're a talented kid.
You're creative.
Bring me a cup of coffee, will you?
I'll trust you.
I want to make you an offer.
I don't really cook much.
She doesn't look happy.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
I had a promise to keep.
We're close enough.
I'll live.
I think Tom is awake.
The movie was a little disappointing.
Mom and Dad are very nervous.
The two generals met again the next day.
That's why I did what I did.
I can't let you enter without a pass.
A long time ago, there was a bridge here.
I aim to be a doctor when I grow up.
You should've quit earlier.
I got up early as usual.
Tom promised he'd go straight home.
The waiters bumped into each other.
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?
How many people were present at the meeting?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
She failed to appear.
My hair is still wet.
You can rely on him.
Tom took the easy way out.
Tom is really motivated.
It was you all along, wasn't it?
Her cleverness often amazes me.
Thanks for coming.
You may change your mind.
My dog is wagging his tail.
Wow! That looks delicious.
I was hoping we could still be friends.
I really am very busy.
Why would she go out of her way to help a deadbeat like you?
I went outside early in the morning.
I don't yet know what I'm going to do.
I'm teasing.
My girlfriend is crying.
I can see the light.
Everyone was happy.
I have no friends to play with.
I live here now.
Tom knows Mary's address.
Yours is not bad, either.
Thanks to this book, I learned some interesting facts about this insect.
She finally reached the hotel.
I'd rather not go into it.
Don't speak so fast.
You have only to watch what I do.
She asked me a question.
No one can escape growing old.
We're going the wrong way.
I've managed to persuade Tom to come.
That should be prohibited.
We'll do whatever it takes to get that done.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
He readily agreed to my proposal.
There was a lot of blood on the floor.
I think it's time we made some changes.
Don't make this personal.
Car accidents are the leading cause of death for teenagers in the United States.
He said it himself.
I can't figure out anything.
No one ever knew the true story except the three of us.
I remember it.
He is always taking a nap at school.
I've heard that it is best to always feed your dog at a specific time every day.
He studies contemporary literature.
What did you get hit with?
I'm reporting for duty.
May I help you?
I was very reluctant.
The Wright brothers succeeded in flying an airplane driven by an engine.
Are you American?
Many people will lose their jobs due to the slump in the auto industry.
I grew up around here.
His grandfather bought him the expensive toy.
I don't give second chances.
I knew there would be trouble when Tom walked into the room.
We have no school today.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
Why do you always do this?
Let's keep an eye on this.
I was married once.
When is your birthday?
He earns more money than he can spend.
Did you forget to buy eggs?
The train finally arrived.
May I use this pencil?
How about staying for dinner? I'm making a big pot of stew.
Did you know him well?
Tom lost his glasses somewhere in the garden.
They all drank.
He suddenly stopped talking.
I could not come to your birthday party.
Tom loves his work.
He was exiled to an island for the crime of high treason.
She is crying.
Do you understand what's going on?
I was born there.
Do you feel like going to the theater?
Where do you all come from?
If you wouldn't mind, I could use a hand.
His room was brightly lit.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
I'm convinced that you're right.
The travelers stayed at a seaside hotel.
Tickets are still available if you hurry.
We need somebody.
You'd better go.
The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in the year 1806.
Tom doesn't like sports.
I have allergies.
I think you should drink some coffee.
He's not stupid.
I've waited for this my whole life.
Smell this flower.
I hate this job.
A gun might come in handy.
Do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
There is hope.
I looked up all the words I didn't know in the dictionary.
You should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive.
I think that's up to you now.
Are you ready for Christmas?
As soon as I can afford it, I plan to travel around the world.
Tom asked Mary to the prom.
I don't know how long.
I don't plan on doing that by myself.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
You're the person who best fits the position.
Don't come near me.
Let me do the talking.
I hate to waste my time.
You don't have to explain.
The twins are very much alike.
We have an open relationship.
We'll have to separate the wires.
You may now kiss the bride.
I love soul food.
No way!
The matter is really pressing.
The newspaper is on the table next to the window.
Tom and I swim together once a week.
Can I talk to you alone for a second?
Your book is on the desk.
The warrior is conscious of both his strength and his weakness.
We're the best at what we do.
We're going to run some tests.
I can't sleep because of the noise.
Do you enjoy living dangerously?
I chose the colors.
I only hope I'm not too late.
I should've taken that more seriously.
I'm seldom at home.
I had no idea you'd be here.
She drank a cup of milk.
Tom is still a little boy.
Just trust me.
Speaking in public makes me nervous.
I was very confused by his questions.
I think it's perfect.
Tom doesn't like frog legs.
I'd like to get medical insurance.
What a big eater!
I have no intention of meddling in your affairs.
Tom is often home.
I keep my word.
I never stay anywhere long enough to make friends.
This is good to know.
It's hard to keep up with his dirty deeds.
Well, what are we waiting for?
His ambition knows no bounds.
Where do you want to live after you retire?
I don't want you hanging out with Tom.
I've never stolen anything from Tom.
Neither of those books is interesting.
I saw him once.
I will go on foot.
I'm a shutterbug.
Tom's afraid.
You shouldn't read in such poor light.
I made a deposit in the bank yesterday.
Where were you for the whole afternoon?
Look around.
Don't buy me presents anymore.
We'll stand.
Everyone did it.
There's a lot of furniture in this room.
May I help you? "Yes, I'm looking for a dress."
I could use some help in the kitchen.
You are early.
Tom died in Mary's arms.
Here comes the bus.
What was in it for you?
Do you still believe I killed my brother?
I'll borrow us some tools.
The case is closed.
I have a right to be happy.
I knew Tom would be heartbroken.
I want to end this.
We hope that you will be able to join us at this seminar.
This book is worth reading.
This girl changed her look.
You don't believe Tom, do you?
You had no choice.
Come here at exactly six o'clock.
Tom left Mary alone in the car.
Rabbits breed quickly.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I'll come into the office early tomorrow.
I had a checklist I used.
Take your shot.
Get up early, and you'll be in time.
It was a wonderful surprise.
You're an idiot.
Tom looks happier today.
Life is enjoyable.
Tom was arrested last year.
She didn't like living in the city.
I sincerely regret having caused you such an inconvenience.
It's not that strange.
She managed to keep up appearances.
Tom's lunch includes a sandwich and an apple.
Please don't use my name.
I don't know how to thank you enough.
I want to be able to speak French like a native speaker.
You had better turn off the light before you go to sleep.
He looked well.
He has eyes at the back of his head.
The scene was quite touching.
He can't tell a cherry tree from a plum tree, but he can name them in twelve languages.
Tom will never believe me again.
As a matter of fact, I know nothing about him.
You've changed since I saw you last year.
I made a fool of myself.
I couldn't figure out how to open the door.
How can we thank you?
Tom drowned his neighbor's cat.
He has trouble remembering names.
Would you be so kind as to open the door for me?
I have a score to settle with him.
Tom turned down the music.
Where can one buy books?
Waiter, I need a napkin.
I never would've guessed.
I can't tell you everything.
I think you should leave now.
We haven't seen Tom in a while.
This is a real popular item.
He longed for his mother.
We aren't married.
What does Tom need?
I knew it was right.
Father doesn't allow me to drive.
How did you find me?
I met an old friend of mine.
Tom and Mary prayed together.
You should help your father.
Do you want the long version or the short version?
I planned a party for Tom.
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
It's a dangerous world.
Tom has lived alone since his wife died.
What did you eat for breakfast?
I was wondering if you would like to go to the dance with me.
He described the incident in detail.
Tom almost cried.
They got into the train.
You have a little fever today, don't you?
How much thinner do you want to be?
I hope Tom never gets out of prison.
Don't expose this chemical to direct sunlight.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
I bought nine flowers.
We'll see each other again someday.
Gestures are very important in human communication.
While she was staying in Japan, she often visited Kyoto.
That was the hard part.
I'm begging you, before freaking out on me listen to the end of what I have to say.
What are you interested in?
They were different.
Isn't that what we anticipated?
I made up my mind to go there.
Tom doesn't have enough friends.
We agree.
I only ask out of curiosity.
Tom is a lot smarter than you think he is.
Tom just stood there watching everybody dance.
He is the fastest runner in our class.
I thought I was going crazy.
Tom's oldest daughter isn't married yet.
Some people see a conspiracy behind almost everything.
She knows everything about cooking.
He's afraid of snakes.
We'll talk later.
Are you leaving tomorrow?
I still make a lot of mistakes.
We didn't have time to see Tom.
Your watch is ten minutes slow.
I've never met a musician that I didn't like.
Don't let anything else distract us.
Tom shouldn't trust Mary.
Mother is cooking in the kitchen.
They want to talk to you a moment.
Do you think it'll stay that way?
Let me handle it.
You can't do it, can you?
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
She tied him up.
The ship was flying the American flag.
What do you think they'll do?
He is riding a bicycle.
The cause of his death still remains a mystery.
She will have to cook for everyone.
Why are you so busy?
I feel a little responsible.
It was a real challenge for us to go down the cliff on a rope.
We can't afford this.
You had a beard the last time I saw you.
Why aren't you taking notes?
My friends dropped by to see me the other day.
He stuck his pencil behind his ear.
I know that I can count on you.
I must repay the debt.
You're not allowed to leave this room.
Where do we go after we die?
That experiment was a failure.
They started dancing.
The package arrived three hours ago.
You'll know soon enough.
How do you plan on paying for that?
Are you having fun?
I sat down and opened my notebook.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I know what they're doing.
She says I need a fresh start.
Nobody heard the bell ring.
It nearly cost him his life.
What are you hinting at?
Tom's a great guy to hang out with.
He didn't like being poor.
I did something stupid.
Be polite to everyone.
I saw the game.
I overheard your conversation.
It took exactly an hour.
I like to feed the pigeons.
Try another door.
That's all I can ask for.
I am so sick.
I'm going to play tennis this evening.
I've been subpoenaed.
He can't afford to buy a new car.
She devoted herself to him.
Please be careful.
I wonder whose car this is.
Who built the snowman?
We'll accept your conditions.
What did I miss?
I'll try to find them for you.
I'm pretty hungry since I haven't eaten since early this morning.
What is the main purpose of your studying English?
I don't feel sick.
I'm very satisfied with your results.
I can't afford to buy another computer.
It's not funny.
You need to do this.
It was not my intention to hurt your feelings.
I can't believe you're here.
Children should obey their parents.
Tom took another bite.
I've got all the friends I need.
I can't keep looking the other way.
There's a lot of chit-chat.
There's plenty of food in the pantry.
I loved that movie when I was a kid.
It's all over for me. I lost my job.
You're not very tidy.
I can't understand what you said at all.
I had to change the plan.
Were you at home all morning?
It is doubtful whether this will work.
I know Tom is ambidextrous.
Do you mind if I smoke?
I don't have time to waste.
I have some powerful friends who can help you.
He can compress the most words into the smallest ideas of any man I ever met.
Tom wondered if Mary would think that eight in the morning was too early for him to open a bottle of wine.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't speak French.
We were at my aunt's last week.
If it happens to rain tomorrow I'll stay at home.
Tom's flight will be arriving early.
I can't go to the cops.
Haven't you seen the doctor?
This book is for you.
I bought the TV from her.
She left home after three days.
Tom needed his parents' approval.
I think that what you need now is a kiss.
Whose house is this?
Write it down before you forget it.
I'm not overly concerned.
We're depressed.
I'm doing my homework.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
Tom certainly doesn't seem to know what he's doing.
He is going to explain it to me.
She told him a joke.
He's not the same man he used to be.
You're one of my best friends.
You probably can't do that.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
I fell asleep while I was doing my homework.
They robbed me blind.
Life is enjoyable.
You won't succeed.
She lit the candles.
You're clever.
Don't be mean.
Tom is a good friend.
Is there a point?
You'd better start at once.
We may as well start at once.
I would like to live in France.
Some Germans work for only one euro an hour.
The issue is not settled.
He was stunned.
Give us a call when you arrive.
I'm breaking up with my girlfriend tonight.
I think we did a very good job.
I can trace my ancestors back 200 years.
They made a list of the names.
I ran outside.
He took on extra workers.
I must insist.
May I help you? "No, thank you. I'm just looking."
The car turned to the left.
Have they spotted you?
Tom won't bother you anymore.
I've heard a lot about you.
You may use his library.
I want to play.
I'm still busy.
This place is weird.
You're an artist.
I'll give you anything but this.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
I'll make you some coffee.
I had no visitors today.
This is a surprising discovery.
I'll spend the night here.
I am playing the piano now.
He wants a new car.
Please send it to me by fax.
He has an unpronounceable name.
Is this all for real?
They were speaking in a Southern dialect.
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
I must warn you that if you do this again you will be punished.
Where's the mistake?
Let's pick flowers from the garden.
Don't be so outraged.
I want to buy a new bicycle.
I will go there on foot or by bicycle next time.
I want you to wait for me.
She quickly opened the letter.
You will never defeat me!
I like having breakfast with you.
My parents made me go there.
Don't wait.
What kind of wine do you recommend?
I'd rather stay at home than go out.
I'll call them.
What else do you know?
Do you really wanna talk about this now?
She wanted a piece of cake, but there was none left.
I didn't realize the difference between them.
Tom trusts him.
Tom didn't have to do this.
It was getting louder and louder.
Insects are arthropods.
We need some more information.
I've been in this situation before.
He thought of a good idea.
You ought to keep working while you have your health.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
Tyrannical governments frequently imprison their political opponents.
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
I have billions of dollars.
When will you stop scheming?
Each of them sang a song.
Tom is one of nicest guys I know.
My younger brother is still sleeping.
I am too tired to walk any more.
I see what you mean.
I'll never be that famous.
Are you guys all right?
Slavery has been abolished in most parts of the world.
I have no homework today.
How would you like it if I hit you?
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Farmers defaulting on loans had to auction off their land.
Will you lend me your bicycle?
I regret not having been honest with you.
What's your major?
Did you get her letter?
Tom named his daughter Mary.
He has enough money.
Your ideas are weird.
Do you really want to eat that?
That was completely unacceptable.
You need to press the button.
Admission is free for preschool children.
Tom drank too much.
You'd be the one to know.
Stay absolutely still.
I'm addicted.
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
She held her baby in her arms.
I urge everyone to do the same.
She spends a majority of her time taking care of her children.
That's not such a good idea.
I can't do my job without a computer.
She lent me her bicycle.
Did you hear all that?
Get us out of here.
Whose bicycle is that?
That's not what you used to say.
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I wonder if the weather will hold.
He paid the money back.
I hope you were able to buy everything you need.
How is the weather?
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
When was the last time you went to an art gallery?
Why did you let me sleep so late?
You're three years younger than Tom.
I regret having said that to him.
I am grateful to you for inviting me to the party.
You're afraid, aren't you?
Why aren't you already on board the ship?
The road is jammed with cars.
He threw a stone at the dog.
The shop was closed when I went there.
I'm chicken.
I didn't have much time.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.
They hate each other from the bottoms of their hearts.
Why are you dressed like that?
Can you tell the twins apart?
You'll have to learn all these dates by rote.
He is apt to forget his promise.
This medication works instantly.
Do you know your blood type?
The room is empty.
Do you want another one of these?
You'd better not swim if you've just eaten.
Could you read this for me?
I'm sorry, but I cannot answer right away.
Tom takes everything too seriously.
Being 25 letters long, 'anticonstitutionnellement' is the longest word in French.
I can't go to work in these clothes.
I think you should grow a beard.
I expected better of you.
If he's still alive, he'd be very old by now.
Few people know how to do it.
I appreciate this so much.
I want to get off this island.
I wasn't cooking anything.
You're not old enough to drive.
Don't tell Father about this.
I don't think it's possible to do that.
He asked me who that man was.
You don't want to tell me why, do you?
No matter what he says, don't trust him.
You're very timid.
It's the next logical step.
Tom calls Mary every night.
She is progressing in Chinese.
He was dressed in blue.
I am American.
Don't try to fool me.
Do you have pictures of your kids with you?
Did you vote in the last election?
We've finished the work, so we may as well go home.
How long did you stay at the party?
I must offer you an apology for coming late.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
I bought you a present.
I left my watch at home.
Tom isn't your brother.
This dress fits me very well.
I hope you're well.
I'll check.
The baby can stand but can't walk.
I know Tom is ridiculous.
This is an easy sentence.
The house was surrounded by fields.
Not everything's about money.
You shouldn't be in here.
Actually, we've already met.
Tell me when to stop.
Who do you think you are to speak to me that way?
I thought I might be of some use.
This is the watch that I bought yesterday.
They did not go there.
Are you doctors?
I have a friend who is a pilot.
A lot of people think that bats are birds.
What sort of people hang out at a place like this?
How much does this cost?
She's Tom's sister.
Are you children all right?
I have no desire to try.
I don't buy that.
My room has three windows.
I want to make you happy.
Don't turn around.
I'm sorry, but I already have other plans.
Tom should've gone to Boston with Mary.
Do your homework now.
His appearance deceived me.
You don't know them.
I think Tom would've stayed longer if he could've.
You're just tired.
It's awfully cold this evening.
I cut across the park.
He's different from before.
Can you really see the future?
I ran to school, but the bell had already rung.
I think that I'm just exhausted.
You have only to watch what I do.
Tom is someone I trust.
Who do you think is the best coach in the NFL?
You must be careful.
Where is my handkerchief?
Few people think so.
We have to put right what we have done wrong.
That was amazing.
You've got my sunglasses and I want them back.
Tom was a great guy.
I might be drunk, but I'm not crazy.
He memorized that poem when he was five years old.
Tom has never kissed anyone in public.
You're very sophisticated.
That's just what I need right now.
All during my trip I could not keep you out of my mind.
Do stop talking and listen to the music.
He knows every inch of this area.
I want you to see what you've done.
I'm very strict.
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
I've been very busy since this morning.
I got up earlier than usual.
The mailman comes around every three days.
The baseball game was put off till next Sunday.
I love jokes about animals.
Tom was ashamed to tell anybody what happened.
I can't express my feelings.
I'm usually not this busy.
Don't tempt me.
You're such an idiot!
You'll soon be able to sing as well as Tom.
They armed themselves with rifles.
The time will come when you will regret it.
All good things come from above.
We didn't have to do that, but we did.
I hope this won't affect our friendship.
Several yachts were sailing side by side far out at sea.
Don't trust him no matter what he says.
He lives in a large house.
English is hard, isn't it?
The boy pretended he could read, but he was holding the book upside down.
Would you mind waiting another ten minutes?
Tom's behavior has changed.
I thought I was dreaming.
In hot weather, water evaporates more quickly.
Make sure to back up all your files.
I asked Tom not to bother us.
We had no drinking water.
They could've killed you.
Go away before they see you here.
This is the flag of Japan.
A fund was set up with a view to preserving our endangered planet.
I'm conservative.
We just want a little help.
Mama cried.
Let's see what's in the box.
Are you still planning to quit your job?
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
It's never too late to start.
He is rather optimistic.
We must take into account the fact that she is old.
They forgot to lock the door.
Who's that?
That was easier than I thought.
Are you the manager?
Are you registered?
Iceland used to belong to Denmark.
I wonder why.
I feel weak.
He's love struck.
The dog marked its territory.
I'm smarter than you.
Who's taking responsibility for this mess?
I regret that this all happened.
I didn't see Tom yesterday.
I wish I could stay longer.
I have some stamps in my bag.
I think it's highly unlikely that I'll ever see my stolen motorcycle again.
I'm Tom. What's your name?
She's six years older than I am.
We worry about your future.
Tom writes something in his diary every evening, no matter how tired he is.
After the meal, I asked for the bill.
Don't touch the wet paint.
They won't help us.
He confirmed that something was wrong with his car.
What are you called?
Turn down the volume.
Even though there was a no U-turn sign, I made a U-turn.
We're reading.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I don't care who's coming.
I broke up with him.
I wish the subway wasn't so crowded every morning.
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
She showed up early for practice.
I think what you're doing is dangerous.
She is no beauty.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
You don't seem too sure.
You've already forgotten.
You ought to know better at your age.
This was his one and only hope.
Is this really necessary?
Do you see that?
You may use my dictionary.
This is my last chance to do this before I go to Boston.
Why not ask Tom?
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
We're totally different people now.
He decided to rent his property to that company.
Please call him up.
I noticed that.
Can you clean your bedroom?
Why do you need change?
He is now in a very difficult situation.
I feel very confident.
I wouldn't be too surprised if this song became a hit.
He sometimes loses hope.
What does it mean when a girl winks at you?
Let someone else handle it.
Dr. Smith has a lot of patients.
She talked him into going to the concert.
This work is difficult for us.
I'm using that cup.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Look at the clock.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
Tom is a very good farmer.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'd like to sit here for a moment.
I like living with Tom.
I'm crazy about you.
I'm not interested in a relationship.
I don't think that's right.
You don't seem to be as organized as Tom seems to be.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm not amused.
I shouldn't have to do all this work myself.
This is all that is known so far.
I had to give it a shot.
He can run as fast as you.
The odds are against me.
How are things at school?
I'm just tired.
Tom comes here every weekend.
Do you really want to do that?
Why are you wearing those?
You have to see it.
Why are you alone?
It's important to eat three square meals a day.
He told the children about his adventures in Africa.
Please choose one person.
Tom asked Mary to drive John to the airport.
My friends don't know where I am.
Hold your breath, please.
Can I borrow your tennis racket today?
That school looks just like a prison.
Go over the choices again.
I have enough money to buy it.
Why didn't you do anything?
I will ask him about it tomorrow, then.
She reminded him to go to the bank.
The man standing over there is the owner of the store.
These are my daughters.
You may be right about that.
Are you proud of yourself?
Tell me about it!
I had a strange experience last night.
Frankly, I don't like what you're wearing.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
Tom is very smart.
That company produces microchips.
The dog chewed on the bone.
It's not that deep.
Don't your neighbors ever complain?
He fell off the horse.
There is enough bread for all of you.
Why can't I play with my friends?
He always does as he pleases.
So what do we do now?
Could I see your driver's license?
It might rain tomorrow.
We'll do away with all these silly rules as soon as we can.
The Tomei Expressway connects Tokyo with Nagoya.
Tom is very proud of his son.
He became a Catholic.
We ran out of gas.
Could you show me that necktie?
They're all terrified.
You're incredible.
I just couldn't resist doing that.
That kid's a chip off the old block.
We're ready now.
Which hat do you want to buy?
Tom isn't really a teacher.
Do you have any aspirin on you?
Tom was found dead in his room.
I like pink grapefruit.
You can open your eyes now.
Do you want some of this?
She always expects me to help her.
A dog is barking.
I can do without his help.
The boat drifted down the stream.
You should've told me yesterday.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Don't forget to take out the garbage.
One crate is still missing.
I don't mind walking in the rain.
Do you agree to our proposal?
What a tragedy!
How does it work?
I'm going to save more money.
I don't get what the fuss is all about.
Don't forget to stir the stew.
I don't care how old you are.
When I heard that song, it reminded me of when I was a kid.
The courts will decide that.
It's a good camera.
There was only one survivor of the accident.
There's no turning back.
He hired a private investigator.
The two of us are finally alone.
I'm impulsive.
Tom is a househusband.
You wouldn't be able to handle the pressure.
I will show you how to solve it.
I was quite nervous.
That's all I can tell you right now.
It is rude to point at others.
They're done.
She began crying.
You don't have to be so rude.
I just don't want to talk to you.
This chapter will focus on the concepts of geometry.
I wonder what could have made him change his mind.
It seems interesting.
I shouldn't have asked you that.
I am fixing the washing machine.
He can run fast.
That was naive of me.
He was born poor, but died a millionaire.
They're undamaged.
This is very useful.
He looked up the word in his dictionary.
How much is the express?
I know Tom was disappointed.
What's Tom's problem?
Just trust me.
I have a friend who can speak French.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
I have a tight schedule.
I'm dying to see you.
Don't take it so personally.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
Could you tell me your name again?
Tom was chosen from among 300 applicants.
A small gear is missing here.
He is staying with his relatives.
This is the easy part.
You had a choice.
Watch your back.
After eating, I go to bed.
I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight.
He kissed his daughter on the forehead.
I don't take orders from you.
That's all you get.
I want to cut down on the time it takes to process records.
He was called away on business.
I love comic books.
Tom is a high school student.
I just don't understand you.
They were surprised.
I don't dance anymore.
Tom has changed very little.
I wasn't really doing much of anything, so I decided it'd be a good idea to walk down to the cafe.
My horse is black.
He drinks a lot.
I know you recently retired.
I hate spinach.
He made a will last year.
Why did you come here?
I wanted to retire three years ago.
That's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
Remind me to never do that again.
By the time she gets there, it will be nearly dark.
Will we arrive on time?
People can't live without air.
It isn't important.
Are you envious?
Tom is lying on his stomach.
It was such a cold day that we decided not to go out.
He likes this guitar.
Did you go to see a doctor?
I looked out the window.
How many of you live here?
How do you help someone who doesn't want your help?
All of them are connected.
When do we start?
Do you have a plan?
Would you like to switch seats?
He defeated his opponent in the election.
I will visit you tomorrow without fail.
You should have been more careful.
Tom is mowing the lawn.
It's a big country.
They called for an end to the fighting.
Room service, please.
I figured you'd be here.
I'll sue you.
I can tell you things you won't hear from anyone else.
Do I know you?
You don't have to do what Tom says.
If so, then there's no problem at all, is there?
We're tired of this.
He was killed in a railroad accident.
I lay on my bed.
We all know that Tom didn't win.
I ought to go there, but I won't.
I don't normally eat this kind of food.
I would do anything but that.
I think you had better take a rest.
I'm here to apologize.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
I can't understand what happened.
You haven't said anything to Tom, have you?
Does your mom know?
I want you both to get them.
Let me tell you how Tom and Mary met.
There's nowhere you can hide.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
A dog's sense of smell is much keener than a human's.
I come from a small town in Australia.
The last thing I want to do now is clean the bathroom.
She looked back on her childhood.
Are you insinuating something?
It's a surprise.
They're really tight.
That's what I'm worried about.
I cut a branch from the tree.
Someone will do this job.
He did it for his family.
I can't stand him.
Is there something wrong with your car?
Everybody has their favorite drink.
Tom really does talk a lot.
He was a member of the Republican Party.
There's nothing wrong, I hope.
How was your trip?
I don't want to work here.
Reading books is very relaxing.
I wanted to impress you.
Tom is going to beat you.
So, what happened this time?
Why did you leave the room?
I didn't want you to leave me.
Can I ask you a question?
That's a hard question to answer.
You lied to Tom.
Is this your bicycle?
Tom changes his passwords often.
That's what's got me worried.
She substituted margarine for butter.
You can all help.
Is the university library open now?
I opened the box. It was empty.
Nothing is as simple as it seems.
Mary invested in the stock because the financial advisor fooled her.
How could you be so cruel?
I wonder if you would mind lending me your car for a couple of days.
It's a comedy movie.
Everyone knows what they have to do, right?
Tom drinks a lot.
This camera is Tom's.
I ran into an old friend at Tokyo Station.
The plane took off at exactly ten o'clock.
Don't be naive.
Come in already.
The devil is in the details.
Don't leave this room.
Why are you so tired today?
What did you come here for?
That's all it takes sometimes.
She looks like her aunt.
I go to work.
I'm not ready to go yet.
This kind of work makes me hungry.
Tom will be delighted to see you.
He did nothing but read newspapers.
The poor old man became so thin that now he's just skin and bones.
He is fluent in Chinese.
Tom doesn't know where to look.
It's really not that cold.
Where on earth did you get it?
Are you happy with your weight?
What does that even mean?
Everyone cheered.
Tom said he didn't want to do that with you.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
I think she is sick.
Tom is very jealous.
Have you ever been lonely?
It appears that he is honest.
You're not listening to me.
I never suspected anything.
I opened an account at a nearby bank.
It makes all the difference.
Her daughter is bad at cooking.
Peel and finely chop the horseradish.
It smells like bleach.
I just want to let you know that I can't attend this afternoon's meeting.
He was accused of stealing money.
I don't like either of them.
May I borrow your bicycle?
Don't talk to me like this.
I can't believe it's true.
Tom didn't know Mary liked him.
The water is pure.
I felt safe.
I'd like to have a glass of wine.
Do you know that guy?
We're in luck.
How many idioms have we studied so far?
How is your weekend going so far?
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Stop reading.
When asked how to do it, he said he didn't know.
Tom said that it was just a coincidence.
It is raining worse than ever.
She has a very good relationship with her students.
She's a beauty.
The way Tom talks annoys me.
Tom looked at Mary and then winked at her.
I'm likely to be able to do that.
I took control of the situation.
Sweating allows the human body to regulate its temperature.
This is a matter of the utmost importance.
I never thought I'd ever get married.
I don't like people laughing at me.
Is Tom still aboard?
I have children.
Keep out of my way.
Let me help you.
We're in the process of writing the report now.
I got up earlier than usual in order to catch the first train.
What do firefighters do when there are no fires?
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
Why did you keep that a secret?
She advised him not to eat too much.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
So what happened to you anyway?
Is there anything you want to know?
I like your new hair color.
Tom often manipulates people.
How about a drink?
That's something we'll improve on.
I can't help how I look.
Tom is terrible at cooking.
I'd like to buy you a beer.
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for October 20th.
They kept talking all the time.
We're enemies.
He's the type who doesn't worry about details.
We just want to be happy.
I missed my flight. Can I get on the next flight?
Why not go to the movies?
Can you at least try?
I am off today.
The weather report said that there will be thunderstorms tomorrow evening.
When will his new novel be published?
They have hostages.
Do you want to drink?
I'm willing to take care of your children, if you want me to.
Are you telling me Tom doesn't do that anymore?
She avoided answering my questions.
Give me a minute, will you?
We won.
Settle down for a while and concentrate.
I'm still kind of hungry.
He intended to marry her.
I have to think.
She is no better than a thief.
We sang for her.
I don't think anyone really expected you to help.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I can't figure out how to solve this problem.
I really hurried.
I don't believe it!
I love her all the more for her faults.
You are responsible for this accident.
I had my personal computer repaired.
I never thought it would end like this.
He made her cry.
The students have returned.
Do you find me unattractive?
I want to go home to see my wife.
The food seems very delicious.
I read a lot of modern authors.
There's a cab waiting outside.
I want you to be my friend again.
I get up at six almost every day.
It was terribly cold yesterday.
Tom knows Mary's dog's name.
Leave your umbrella in the hall.
Is the dog swimming?
We could all be dead tomorrow.
It's the law now.
What do you remember about Tom?
If you're tired, go to bed.
The main idea in his speech was unity.
I haven't really made up my mind yet.
As food and drink is to animals, so are rain and sunshine to plants.
Stories often have happy endings.
It's because I was asked to come that I'm here.
Sign on the dotted line.
Everything changes after a war.
It's quite good.
Do you really think we'll find Tom?
What's all the excitement about?
No one was killed.
The sun rises in the morning.
I ate a slice of ham.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
You're the one that went crazy.
We're ready to fight.
It's time for our children to go to bed.
Did you leave a tip?
He was scared to do it.
What's going on in here?
My brother is in Australia now.
I can fix it.
Do you drink wine?
I hope you two are hungry.
Father makes sure that all the lights are off before he goes to bed.
Tom is an HR consultant.
I always take a bath in the morning.
She is fresh from college, so she has no experience.
I've always been very proud of that.
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
He will be waiting for her.
Put it in the closet.
My parents know about it.
I think you're a really nice guy.
Why are you late?
Maybe I should take this.
Do you feel lucky?
Tom did it single-handedly.
Are you going to eat those fries?
Tom just contacted us.
I don't know where my keys are.
I hope that helps.
I saw one.
Let me know when you've finished.
What are you punishing them for?
I called your office today, but you weren't in.
Did you pick up on that strange tone in his voice?
We have time to sing one more song.
I met him just now.
She got married to him.
Please bear in mind what I said.
Are you certain?
Our college uses far too much electricity.
I've been thinking about it the entire day.
Do you have time for one more question?
He lost his job.
What time will you have breakfast?
Where did you put my keys?
Tom is dumb, but not that dumb.
How come you didn't call me last night?
You seem busy.
Do you want to eat out tonight?
She brought me a cup of tea.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
She has a book under her arm.
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.
You can't give me orders.
Tom greeted Mary with a smile.
I didn't know Tom was afraid of ghosts.
Why are you so hard-headed?
People are sometimes tempted to eat more than they should.
It really doesn't affect you, does it?
We're staying in different hotels.
I don't understand this at all.
I work out whenever I can.
I don't think we want to go down that road.
I can do this.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Tom could do that.
I handled it.
None of them said anything.
Since you have a fever, you should stay home.
I'll end up by going crazy.
That was a funny joke.
You still haven't told me where you live.
Tom can't swim as well as Mary.
No one knew who I was.
Where exactly did you go?
We found one large footprint and a couple of different size smaller footprints.
I attended the meeting on her behalf.
You don't have to come.
How many times have you lied to me?
We waste a lot of time.
At the most, the trip will cost $1,000.
The doctor pronounced him dead.
We saw you.
In general, kids like ice cream.
The law doesn't apply to this case.
You're messing with me, right?
I can barely remember what my grandfather looked like.
He asked her if she knew him.
Almost everyone was late.
We're prejudiced.
Ain't she cute?
He is likely to win the game.
They have a problem.
I ate with my parents.
I'm done with you.
They want the best.
He is used to speaking in public.
You're the master.
Don't give up hope.
We import many things from Australia.
There are only five minutes left till the train leaves and she hasn't appeared.
You remind me of my daughter.
Where are you headed for?
You were such a big help yesterday.
I want what's best for both of us.
I saw a cottage in the distance.
Have you tried it before?
I didn't want to involve you.
Tom was speaking faster than usual.
The performance began at 8:00.
Let's not talk about your job tonight.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
This cloth feels like velvet.
I need to know who you are.
What made her so sad?
Compared to you, I'm just a beginner at this game.
Is that unfair?
Where do you come from?
I think watching people playing chess isn't much fun.
We've got enough space here.
I suddenly feel depressed.
I saw you yesterday.
The theory is not accepted yet.
I take a nap almost every day.
I don't think Tom would lie.
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
You may still be in luck.
All we can do is wait for him.
Follow me.
How do you stop this?
We're perfectly safe here.
Are you seeing anybody right now?
I don't think you did this by yourself.
He left his wife.
I'm willing to take care of your children, if you want me to.
Can you translate that into French?
He likes taking walks.
I thought it must be something like that.
Are you ready to begin?
How do you talk to women?
I'm not ashamed to tell you.
My dog has been missing for three days.
I didn't know you were unhappy.
I don't really have a gun.
Private detectives were hired to look into the strange case.
I love the way Tom does that.
Most of them urged him to take the job.
You're very astute.
You may never be able to walk again.
Tom is as tall as his father.
He shaved his mustache off.
Many people were late for the concert.
When will that picture I wanted enlarged be ready?
Large catches of squid are a sign of a coming earthquake.
What will you do?
The train is late.
The urban-renewal project is now well under way.
I want to know where you heard that.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
We're winning.
He closed the door.
All you have to do is to wait.
He had never canceled an appointment before.
My parents wouldn't understand.
You didn't let me answer.
I hope that won't happen.
Are you the one who caused this mess?
I cannot agree to your proposal.
They love their mother a lot.
The hurricane has already caused havoc in the Caribbean.
Is this the bus to Oxford?
All the girls laughed.
Japanese is often said to be a difficult language to learn.
We had a good time playing chess.
Mother went shopping with my brother.
Am I on the right road?
There's nothing going on here.
By the way, how many kids are going?
Don't apologize.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
How much did all this cost?
This custom dates back to the 12th century.
I saw many people who had no clothes and I saw many clothes which had no people in them.
Every student was asked his or her name and birthplace.
An innocent man was arrested by mistake.
You have only to push this button.
She will always be in my heart.
He got a master's degree in law.
He stood up.
I don't want to get my hands dirty.
Our ancestors arrived in this country 150 years ago.
We are his sons.
We're all done.
I'm not frightened of ghosts.
I thought I'd find you here.
Now and then I think of divorcing him. "You must be kidding!"
My grandmother was pulling up weeds in her backyard.
He gets angry if he's contradicted.
Can you translate that into French?
Don't you ever say that again.
In case of fire, break this window.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
I know the cure for what ails you.
I can't go on with this.
A woman's wardrobe isn't complete without a little black dress.
The movie was so sad that everybody cried.
Do you want anything to eat?
I want to thank you for helping me.
I didn't really care about that.
Why didn't you say something earlier?
I think we both know how Tom feels.
I got him to fix my bicycle.
I have to get out of here.
Just get out of here.
I know that you left early.
Neither you nor I are mistaken.
Some people read the newspaper while watching television.
That does happen occasionally.
I may be too old.
It's better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
I don't want to sleep.
She saw him at the station.
You must not go out today.
I was asked to identify the body.
Luck comes to those who look for it.
I expect that Tom will pass the exam.
You should have seen me.
If you look carefully, you'll see that the box has a false bottom.
I didn't want to humiliate you.
I should probably not be doing this.
I wonder what to make for dinner.
United we stand, divided we fall.
I don't ever want to see you again.
It seems my dreams never come true.
I made two.
No one is home.
You can trust him.
We were all so busy then.
I was heartbroken.
Who sent you?
You look happy.
They called for an end to the fighting.
He felt himself growing old.
Please iron the shirt.
Watch your tongue.
We're going to see Tom again.
I think Tom left.
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof.
She was not in the mood for lunch.
She went outside to get a breath of fresh air.
I hated history class.
They're about to leave.
It's starting to grow on us.
I'm being honest with you.
You don't have permission to do that.
Tom poured milk into the cup.
How did they do that?
I live a simple life.
What'll it be like?
I don't disagree with your decision.
I'm not really worried about that.
Did you invite him?
I'm proud of myself.
You need to sit down and rest.
He will commit suicide if he can't see his son.
When did the Thirty Years' War take place?
Mary told Tom that she was moving to Boston.
My father bought me a digital watch for birthday present.
What have you eaten today?
She doesn't get outdoors much.
I can't tell you why.
I really like being with you.
I am beginning to remember it.
I'm working for McDonald's.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
We were both wrong.
Tom is overemotional.
Nobody was listening to the speech.
You should stay in bed.
She has been to England once.
We need the money.
When shall I return the book?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I didn't bring this topic up with her.
You're pulling my leg.
I need to finish packing up.
It's an interesting argument.
I haven't been successful.
I managed to finish the work.
She needs you.
I don't want to shoot you.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
I get the idea.
Tom is strong, but Mary is stronger.
I thought Tom was in prison.
Who could possibly believe this?
I've always considered you a close friend.
It is so early.
Buy it for me, please.
Why are you angry? "I'm not angry!"
Tom is environmentally conscious.
Luckily nobody drowned.
Take care!
I wish winter vacation would never end.
I got dumped.
I'm the one who killed Tom.
I really misjudged you.
Do you want to go out tonight?
This is what Tom gave me.
Quit acting like a child.
Please tell me what Tom said.
I'm not very hungry.
I'm an orphan.
You have a little fever today, don't you?
I have something very important to tell you.
Are we prepared?
Is that your sister?
Pull over here.
Everything is so expensive.
Tom is afraid of you.
You may choose either of the two books.
He is one of my old friends.
Tom has no close friends.
No way!
You're the engineer.
What are you still doing here?
He will regret this.
May I call you tomorrow?
How many times do I have to tell you not to eat candy just before dinner?
I turned off the tap.
She slapped him.
I'm glad you brought that up.
It is impossible for you to do so.
I just figured out what the problem is.
Your parents can't keep us apart forever.
I remember this music.
A merchant is a person who buys and sells goods.
We're trustworthy.
Brush your teeth.
He was impressed.
Show me how to do it, please.
There were a lot of men among the inhabitants.
Tom lived in Boston before, right?
We never work on Sunday.
I'd like to confirm the departure time.
A blind person's hearing is often very acute.
Where is your jacket?
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
Tom and Mary washed the dishes together.
Tom is waiting for you.
I'm sorry, my mother's not at home.
I don't think I'd want to do that.
This car looks pretty cool.
Do you want to go to a soccer game?
I was bored, so I left.
Would you be willing to help?
Let's pick up Tom.
Are we safe here?
Would you like to hear me sing a song?
She helped her father with the work in the garden.
Hey guys, I think I found something.
When I was your age, Pluto was a planet.
I'm sure if you put your mind to it, you can do it.
I'm sure Tom had his reasons.
How do you use this camera?
I had a nightmare.
Get your hands off me.
Don't just take my word for it.
Laws differ from state to state in the United States.
You're the only one who can help.
I was born and raised here.
It was black.
Keep me in the loop.
Tom asked me if anything was the matter.
How did you get here?
He was walking in front of me.
Tom tasted the cake.
I got remarried.
Who will be coming to the party? "A few friends and four or five colleagues."
Lie still.
They finished their meal.
So, do you really want to do this?
I feel bad about ruining your party.
I can't stand it any longer.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
I'm not a monster.
You're very curious.
I hope Tom and Mary don't get arrested.
That offer sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?
I was promoted three months ago.
We'll be there in thirty minutes.
Tom gave me this watch.
He couldn't hold his temper any longer.
This is a story about a cat.
For the first time in more than 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6%.
Everyone got off the bus.
I'm terrified.
He will do anything to make money.
What kind of software does Tom usually use?
The worst part is, it wasn't always like this.
When do owls sleep?
Fast forward to the part where they're kissing.
He ran away at the sight of a policeman.
I found Tom's diary.
My son is small for his age.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
He took part in the anti-war demonstration.
Tell me why I should do that.
What are they doing?
What do you like about him?
She is singing the latest popular songs.
Are you as tall as me?
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
Every little boy needs a hero.
I left.
Your sister's sleeping.
I spend most of my time at home.
Fear washed across the stock market.
Can you stay for a bit?
I stayed with my uncle.
Glass breaks easily.
I hope we survive.
You look like you've just lost your best friend.
She has brought up five children.
You're going to have to stop doing that.
My father always sleeps while watching the TV.
This river isn't deep enough for this kind of boat.
That's not a crime.
Write in the date yourself.
This is my city now.
You could have told me.
I want to see the countryside.
Wait one moment.
Let me know as soon as he comes.
It's bedtime.
I just fainted. That's all.
They acted on the information.
I wasn't invited.
Did you find anything?
I can't tell you what Tom told me.
Tom visits his parents every weekend.
If people who smoke are deprived of their cigarettes, they get nervous and irritable.
Do you have a lot to do?
I love weddings.
Take this folding umbrella with you. It might come in handy.
There's not much I can do for you.
The snow prevented the airplane from taking off.
Tom never admits that he's wrong, because he thinks that's a sign of weakness.
Hurry up, or you'll miss your plane.
They're safe.
I think you're too picky.
Did you find out what time the meeting starts?
Have you ever heard her sing on stage?
I'm going back home tomorrow.
You can still see the ship.
Are you just going to stand there all day?
You wanted me to get a job, so I did.
When he saw me, he started running.
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain.
Dead men tell no tales.
When does the restaurant open?
I've promised Tom I would help.
This is mind blowing.
Tom met Mary on the way to school.
Are you going to save us?
I thought I was alone.
It's popular among the elderly.
I drank the water.
I let you down.
I usually prefer to pay with credit card and not with cash.
He married his daughter to a lawyer.
It was obvious that they had lied.
They say she is the kindest woman on earth.
I'm not really that old.
Do you plan to buy that car?
Do you travel a lot?
I suspect you're right.
Is this Tom's umbrella?
Tom shot Mary.
I'll take a nap after lunch.
New York is a huge city.
Are you going on foot or by bus?
Here is your bag.
I'm very upset.
He is hard up for money.
One does not wear a red mini skirt to a funeral.
Could you help me out a little?
I wonder where Tom is.
You look happy today.
I put a knife on the table.
They elected her president.
I prefer to go alone.
Tom said he enjoyed it.
Did we miss anything?
This conversation is a masterpiece.
I let my friend copy my homework.
The students bowed to their teacher.
You can't change your mind now.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
You're too loud.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants him to do.
I can't believe I locked myself out again.
Because I live near the school, I come home for lunch.
I'm saving up for my old age.
I've been here all week.
Something's wrong.
At any rate, we can't change the schedule.
This is Tom's grave.
He speaks English.
More and more Americans go abroad.
I was happy to help you.
I'm sorry that I can't be who you want me to be.
He's eating an apple.
Disneyland was very interesting. You should've come with us.
Tom is no longer welcome in my house.
A few of these are mine.
How can you sleep at night?
Can you show it to me?
I need it.
You understand German, right?
We aren't afraid of death.
Excuse me, but I can barely hear you.
I think I'm in trouble with my wife.
The accident happened the day before yesterday.
What is your name?
I want to quit.
Try to open the door.
Do you remember seeing me before?
You can do whatever you want now.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
How long may I keep this?
We're just students.
I've seen this before.
The pleasure is mine.
He went to Paris two years ago.
Your composition is the best yet.
I want to buy them all.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I can read your mind.
You aren't as short as I am.
He did not like children.
I was discredited.
I ate a salad for lunch.
I talked to her.
This was very interesting.
I really like it, too.
I'm no saint.
Could we discuss this?
I really appreciate your coming.
Why are you doing this to me?
We'll work on this tomorrow.
Be nicer to your sister.
You're impressed, aren't you?
How was the roast beef?
I'll bring the beer.
I wish I had a car.
I dipped my finger into the honey.
What are you doing tomorrow?
How big you are!
I'm sorry, my father's not here.
That wasn't very nice of you.
Can you see anything over there?
This is kind of embarrassing.
Does this look good on me?
We saw another ship far ahead.
One of your neighbors complained.
Could you please fix this flat tire?
Can you help me on this one?
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
This is between you and me.
I have enough money to buy it.
Nobody defends my country.
I borrow money.
Tom volunteered to pay for the damages.
Thanks for coming.
Neither of us wants to get married.
I've already read this book.
School begins the day after tomorrow.
I just can't get it right.
She starts her job at seven o'clock.
He left me the keys.
We depend on you.
Plutonium-244 has a half-life of 80 million years.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
Do you love my brother more than me?
Tom has been to Australia three times.
I can prove it to you.
She is not tall.
I changed clothes.
She lost her new watch.
Stop teasing me.
Where is the ticket office?
There is a chance that he will pass the exam.
I'll get by if I have a place to sleep.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I suppose you want to ask me what I was doing yesterday.
That's the hardest part.
I'll take care of my parents when they get old.
We don't do that as often as we used to.
Where's the nearest train station?
Everyone drew their own conclusions.
My mother gets up earlier than I do.
I knew Tom was against it.
I think my job is pointless.
Do you own research.
You need to be careful.
I heard the children's happy voices.
I think it's a fair decision.
Tom works part-time.
Your mother loves me.
You can't live without water.
We'll talk at dinner.
You can't reason with Tom.
We have arrived safe and sound.
I have something.
I have not eaten any seafood since the recent oil spill.
Fashions grow old and die.
Tom asked Mary to stop smoking.
Since there were no customers, we closed the shop early.
I'm not wealthy.
I bought a new television.
You're not dressed.
I have no opponents.
He seems honest.
I need to know now.
He studies American history.
If you want any help, just call me.
Why are you all here?
I feel like I let the team down.
I need a break.
One of Jesus' disciples was named Paul.
I need a hammer.
I don't know if I should tell you.
If it is fine tomorrow, we'll go on a picnic.
I'm glad I don't have your job.
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
Who's at the switchboard today?
There is an apple under the desk.
Do you still love him?
He's a bit rough around the edges.
How could you not remember?
I noticed the difference.
He had the nerve to take my car without asking.
Tom took out some coins and handed one to Mary.
This isn't mine.
The meeting is over.
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
How much is there left?
Two families live in the same house.
I'm listening to music.
He makes sense.
Has your dog ever bitten you?
Do you know a good dentist?
We had a wonderful time.
That's what makes me nervous.
Don't deny it.
Nobody will know I'm here.
What do you have to lose?
We've just spent two weeks apart.
I was outraged, too.
There is no hurry.
You aren't ready for this.
The employee was escorted off the premises.
What you're doing right now is a crime.
I think you're nuts.
You can't deny that.
May I look at the menu?
We haven't seen it yet.
Excuse me for a moment.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to live.
She needs our help.
It was necessary.
You go first.
Cancer can be cured if discovered in time.
You're overworked.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
Will you keep my valuables for me, please?
Don't believe everything that you hear.
How much am I paying you?
No one can escape.
Don't cave into their demands.
Has he arrived already?
Do you talk to your cats?
You are impossible.
Have you ever heard her sing on stage?
Have you met everyone here?
I heard you got a new car.
I need to finish writing my speech.
This heater won't heat up that large room.
I think you knew my father.
Why blame just Tom?
His sudden death was a tragedy.
How is your weekend so far?
I feel worse today than I did yesterday.
How do I look?
I beg you to help me.
Welcome back.
He has a lunch.
I don't like Tom at all.
They're strong.
I had no idea who she was.
Tom didn't feel tired.
This work calls for a high degree of skill.
If it were not for plants, we wouldn't be able to live.
Tom is just trying to get under your skin.
I have a problem dealing with authority.
Stop deluding yourselves.
This is my painting.
It's an hour's walk to the station.
Tom is quite drunk.
Can you unjam the printer?
Fight like a man.
Bring along your friend.
Tom promised to help me.
We usually sleep in this room.
I want to do this.
She gave me her phone number.
I can't function without you.
You're imagining things.
Tom is still in the bathroom.
Tom has forgotten how to do it.
Tom hasn't thought this through.
That's not what I'm here for.
Could you leave me one?
I'm not afraid of snakes.
I know Tom is finished.
She has a son and two daughters.
Everyone was hurt.
I've been waiting all night.
You are so stupid.
Wipe your eyes.
I want to rent a car.
I don't know when my mother will come back.
That was our goal.
You taught me that.
It started a chain reaction.
Why don't you listen to me?
I'm looking for work.
The machine stopped functioning.
Using a flashlight, the policeman signaled the car to stop.
Tom looked Mary in the eye.

You have no messages.
I have another obligation.
I heard my parents whispering last night.
The coat is not mine.
Tom took ski lessons.
We're experienced.
Is Tom able to eat?
I want a jump rope with wooden handles.
That's just what he needed.
I never meant to do that.
You don't have to apologize.
They liked having more space for their children to play.
It's time to go home.
Would you mind not talking about your surgery now - I'm trying to eat.
Do you want to go to jail?
Let's drop it.
She would often come late for school.
The mayor didn't like what the journalists wrote.
Tom was wearing shoes, but he wasn't wearing socks.
I read in the newspaper that he had been murdered.
I was beginning to have my doubts.
Get out of my seat.
They knocked on the door and said they had come to arrest him.
You didn't pay.
In a word, she is guilty.
I'm offended.
We must help each other.
I saw the movie.
You enjoyed that, didn't you?
I've asked myself that question a million times.
Come a bit closer.
You're very understanding.
He is very friendly to us.
If I'd known it, I'd have told you.
While I was waiting for the bus, I witnessed a traffic accident.
We live far from the airport.
Do it at once.
I'm happy to be back.
Do whatever you want about it.
I agree with this wholeheartedly.
It's because of you that we were late.
You want to go out for a drink?
The jail is overcrowded.
He sat next to her.
What were you doing in the attic?
He's got the flu.
What time do you go to bed?
She talks as if she knew everything about it.
Those chairs are in the way.
What time is your appointment?
I have to sleep.
Can you help me on this one?
It never occurred to him that she would get angry.
I don't get many visitors.
It's not dinnertime yet.
Can I ask why this is so important to you?
I must go alone.
Are you so stupid that you can't see it?
Then I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem.
The goods were transported by ship.
Don't tell me to go home.

I am ashamed about what happened yesterday.
I know every inch of New York.
They finished their meal.
Because of the bad weather, the plane's departure was delayed by two hours.
I didn't have chains for my car, so I stayed home.
Tom is as busy as Mary is.
He drank a shot of whiskey.
All the houses in this neighborhood look so much alike that I can't tell them apart.
I'm looking for your sister. Where is she?
I can't believe that didn't work.
I still haven't found anything.
Do you like this garden?
Who are you selling your car to?
Remember these rules.
We all want the same thing.
Stop being cruel.
We have limited resources.
I hurt myself today.
They are very kind.
You're going to have to deal with that.
Tom doesn't know the difference between an adjective and an adverb.
You've barely said a word all night.
That's what we saw.
Tom said he thought Mary was scared.
I know your father.
He stayed at a cheap hotel.
Tom swam with the dolphins.
They all have drinks.
He went back to the store.
God created man in his own image.
Why don't you take the day off?
What was Tom's reaction?
I thought we could eat out on the patio.
I don't really want to go there by myself.
I will wait for you at the bus stop.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
My parents made me go there.
The medicine didn't help at all.
Only Takeuchi didn't accept the invitation.
Tom is extremely patient.
It was a pretty amazing experience.
He drove the car, listening to music on the radio.
Tom died at home.
You should stop drinking.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
This painting is a forgery.
All of the students were present.
Tom has lived in Chicago for a year.
I didn't hear you come in.
The number of members will grow quickly.
I study very little.
Children often cry just because they want some attention.
Isn't there anything that will make you feel better?
I just don't understand it.
Tom is very likely to succeed.
An undercover operative infiltrated the organization.
He is unrealistic.
Drop the gun.
It's important.
He was imprisoned.
You're being paranoid.
I'm not convinced of that.

He went traveling in search of adventure.
Tom just wants to spend a little more time with Mary.
Tom keeps hanging up on me.
He said that you had better go.
Somebody is shouting my name.
Why can't I hear?
My opinion differs from hers.
Did you sew this by hand?
I like cake.
Is the tap water in Australia drinkable?
I didn't ask for help.
My car ran out of gas.
I think Tom is in love.
I hate my roommate.
You have to tell me what to do.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
He deserves the prize.
I want to be with you more than anything.
Please don't waste my time.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
I'm not very busy.
My clock needs to be fixed.
I'll come back later.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.

No matter what happens, don't forget to smile.
About this time tomorrow, we'll be climbing Mt. Fuji.
Why do you put up with that?
It was too soft.
He has been living in Ankara since 2006.
Get me something to eat.
You're not bruised.
I want you to be prepared.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
I lost my camera the other day.
That's Tom's house with the red roof.
He felt it was his duty to go.
They were plainly dressed.
Go straight until you see the post office, then turn right.
Say hello to your father for me.
He stood with his feet apart.
I got a little too impatient.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
Tom opened his beer and took a sip.
She became a postman.
Get out!
That's just what he needs.
I'll look after your child while you are away.
Let me spell it out for you.
I know Tom doesn't do that.
You have no right to go there.
This book is so difficult, I can't read it.
Contracts have already been negotiated.
People look at things differently depending on whether they are rich or poor.
Very few people aren't afraid of death.
She has no shame.
I go to the beach almost every day.
What do you want to do today?
There was no toilet paper.
We have lunch at noon every day.
They were even more interested in his beautiful wife.
You're running short of time.
I don't think Tom is colorblind.
Give me another example.
Tell me more.
I'm not sure I believe you.
Tom got his nose pierced.
This isn't a new car.
I know a good restaurant that's inexpensive.
What time did the meeting end?
Tom is a shrewd businessman.
She betrayed you.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Who are you talking with?
Do you like his songs?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I ate on the bus.
One of them spoke to me.
It could be better.
You need to be more patient.
Don't judge me too harshly.
A pretty waitress waited on us.
I should've been with you.
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
I told you it was going to be cold here.
Somebody laughed.
What do you see?
Tom remembered the last time he had hugged Mary.
Can you hear us?
Mary is my niece.
Don't you think Tom and John look alike?
I enjoy poker.
Buy low, sell high.
I have found your dirty little secret.
Somebody laughed.
Give me a minute.

This isn't easy.
Go to your room.

What do you have?
He's angry at the world.
I've seen that.
I forgot you don't like carrots.
I feel better today than yesterday.
The responsibility is mine.
I don't want you to lie to me.
Close your eyes and picture a log house.
Someone's behind me.
I can't stand the noise.
The crankshaft is broken.
They grow flowers in the garden.

Please sum up your idea.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
She started at the top.
No one spoke.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
Sometimes it's necessary to tell the truth.
You can't prove that.
That girl looks boyish.
I know what you did.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Not all experts agree.
It's better to err on the side of caution.
Keep your hands off my bike!
That's all wrong.
Stop playing hard to get.
Are you mentally ill?
Who's that boy swimming over there?
Do you really want to know?
Do you mind if I go?
Wait here till he comes back.
Don't forget your stuff.
Don't throw a stone at the dog.
Tom is just a little bit shorter than me.
They betrayed you.
He often laughs at his own jokes.
I think you need a lawyer.
I should've told Tom.
She goes to night school.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
Why do you want such an old car?
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
Did you bring a weapon?
He respects me.
His wealth has not made him happy.
I noticed Tom was smiling.

They live on the floor beneath.
Can you tell me about it?
It seems to me that we should go now.
Would you like to see your husband grow a beard?
Well, let's go.
Your nose is bleeding.
She pleaded with him to stay a little bit longer.
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
The boy caught a large fish.
She wants to kill me.
I don't know who knows.
I don't like drinking.
I don't believe you anymore.
You can handle this without me.
The students are sitting in a circle.
Here's an example.
No one knows me like you do.
You're not allowed to leave this room.
You are stupid.
I'm familiar with the way he asks questions.
Are you relaxed?
The game is not over.
Do you have a few CDs?
Pass me the salt, please.
Are you sure you don't want something a little smaller?
May I talk with you in private about the matter?
Thanks for the information.

Literature teaches us about humanity.
The problem was difficult to solve.
I can't tell you how much I've looked forward to this moment.

She wouldn't allow me to read the letter.
Tom loves his job.
She refused my invitation.
I need to tell Tom everything.
I agreed to help him in his work.
Selling cars is my business.
Does that price include soup and salad?
I can't believe I really did that.

This is not Disneyland.
Are we done?
You really have a talent for translation.
I have to finish what I started.
I do not understand her.
We were going steady.
I can't help it if girls want to flirt with me.
I spoke with Tom today.
The tip of the spear was dipped in a deadly poison.

Does it make a big difference?
Half of the melons were eaten.
He delivers newspapers.
We were just going.
I bought her some drinks.
I haven't seen you in ages.
I think we'd better be going.
Do you know this song?
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
His hair was brown.
Do you have any more of those?
In the future, you have to get here on time.
I persuaded him to give up the idea.
Where are the bags from Flight 57?
I felt like my life was over.
I don't make mistakes.
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
What on earth do you think you're doing?
Are you really going to let Tom do that?
Remain seated, please.
Tom reloaded his gun.
He is quite a savage.
I see her sweeping the room.
He came from another country.
You're thin.
He's a high school student.
I realized I couldn't win.
He tends to get angry when people oppose him.
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I respect your opinion.
We're all safe.
We were right.
He made up an excuse.
I have to be punished.
Today is election day in Poland.
I own this car.
No one trusts him any more.
Tom likes games.

Leave him alone.
The doctor advised him to ease up on alcohol.
I didn't hear much.
We should let sleeping dogs lie.
Tom was accepted to Harvard.
Are you really sick?
We know.
It's garbage.
That was a costly mistake.
You should ask Tom what happened.
The shop on the corner sells fruit at a very good price.
I'd like to invite you to dinner.
There is usually a cool breeze here in the evening.
Tom still doesn't know what happened.
He is leaving for New York next week.
Take care!
You are not to leave this room.
We have bananas.
Were you out last night?
I had a valid visa, so I was allowed to enter the country.
That's where I live.
We haven't yet finished what we have to do.
There is a television in my room.
I'm going to count to three.
Tom did a pretty good job.
I'm asking you to do this because I trust you.
That's all I have left.
He's open-minded.
French is a very difficult language for me.
Have they responded?
How will you pay your debts?
She was holding an umbrella.
I've brought it back.
We don't really have to talk about this right now, do we?
He has a beard.
Your stupid remark just added fuel to the flames.
Where did you go to college?
What's your husband's name?
I'd hate to see that happen again.
How can you not remember?
He set a trap to catch the animal.
They did what they were told.
Is he going to help us?
The more time you spend talking about what you do, the less time you have to do it.
Let's do this before I change my mind.
How much time does she need to translate this book?
Do you really think Tom will do that?
I can't believe what we were about to do.
They have four classes in the morning.
I wish I could write as well as Tom.
Tom has been told not to do that here.
Tom did it all.
Do you believe in fairies?
He was granted admission to the university.
I want to continue doing that.
She advised him to exercise.
I'll hang onto it for now.
Tom didn't keep me waiting long.
I knew you'd be mad.
I'm no quitter.
I go shopping every morning.
Take all the time you need.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
Exercise is to the body what thinking is to the brain.
She called me up from Tokyo.
That's dangerous.
You will know soon enough.
The answer is no.
Please shuffle the cards carefully.

How can you make your way in life without a good education?
You cheated.
I have decided to carry on the work.
They worked through the night.
I want to hear you play the piano.

Does the smoke bother you?
I want to hear all about your trip.
The resistance movement has gone underground.
They're going to try.

No one understands you.
I like a challenge.
That could be wrong.
I doubt Tom really needs to do that.
Should I ask him out?
Do I have your permission to do so?
He went in place of me.
There's nothing to be scared of.
A drunkard is somebody you don't like and who drinks as much as you do.
I don't know what you mean.
Her diaries formed the basis of the book she later wrote.
They don't have any weapons.
I'll come by 10.
Please try again.
You still haven't told me how old you are.
We're ruined.
Ring the bell.
Hang on!
You are beautiful.
Do you want to do this now?
I was bored, so I wandered around town.
I realized I couldn't win.
I'm going to buy you a watch.
I will start working on July first.
I don't think I can do anything else.
We'll eat on the way.
Something is very wrong.
They wouldn't understand.
She accused him of stealing her money.
Should I help them?
We're home.
Do you have any small change?
I'm the one who painted this picture.

Let's play by ourselves.
I'll watch television.
Don't mention this to anyone.
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.
I just want to go back to class.

You'll be fine.
You're ambitious.
Dark clouds gathered over the horizon.
I'm going to prepare for the final exams this afternoon.
We have wine.
I enjoy playing the blues.
Do you have an English dictionary?
We weren't invited to the opening ceremony.
Talk to me!
That's the best I can do.
You can't eat here.
Smoking does you more harm than good.
Can't you speak English?
How did they do that?
Tom was a better cook than Mary was when they got married.
It's too hard.
I haven't seen him for years.
Can you show me how to do this?
Did I say something funny?
I want to be very clear about that.
Do you know anything about it?
Your performance was very good.
I don't feel like eating anything.
I forgot my medications.
There's food on the table.
Let me sleep.
My house was robbed while I was away.
Are you doing what you think is right?
The trip will take at least five days.
I saw fear in his eyes.
I'm not going to force you to do that.
I sat down next to him.
Tom doesn't want an iPad. He wants a portable device that supports Flash.
I am no longer young, but I can still bite.
Tom, this is my cousin.
He provided them with food.
I needed money.
We went to Australia by plane.
If it had not been for your foolishness, we would never have been in that trouble.
Tom threatened Mary.
I wanted you to keep that.
If that were true, what would you do?
I didn't know the truth until yesterday.
Are you tired of living?
He is lying through his teeth.
It's a waste of time and money.
You don't have to come.
The president ignored the protesters outside his office.
I regret kissing you.

He got good marks in math.
I think you know everyone here.
A nail punctured the tire.
What am I going to do?
I'm not going to tell you again.
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
When will it be ready?
Tom isn't safe.
The results were very bad.
Every season is different.
He is familiar with Japanese culture.
Can you tell me what this symbol means?
I just want to be a good neighbor.
She likes nobody and nobody likes her.
Is the job too much for you?
Tom doesn't seem busy.
The book fell to the floor.
Tom can't hurt me.
I will see him after I get back.
I found your cap.
Scorpions are dangerous.
How do you read this kanji?
Tom wants a better percentage of the profits.
I didn't wait for Tom.
Tom takes a bath every evening after dinner.
You ought to have been more careful.

I'll make you proud of me.
Tom tripled his investment in six months.
Which language do you use when you speak to your parents?
Love conquers all.
I got dealt a bad hand.

All the prisoners escaped.
I think it's time for me to show you how to do that properly.
French is difficult to learn.
I'll never change my mind.
I know Tom plays the bass.
He had the gift of prophecy.
It's very unlikely that a serious art collector would ever buy anything from that source.
They showed it to our company.
I don't feel like playing either.
They know what happened.
Don't forget your coat.
She pushed the door shut.
She's as pretty as her sister.
I was careful.
She found me a good seat.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I was late for the train.
May I go home?
I'm not very good at French.
Why don't I have a girlfriend?
I don't like the way you laugh at her.
My father has five brothers and sisters.
It never occurred to me to take a picture of how the garden looked before we started pulling weeds.
Did you telephone him?
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
I would do the same.
What do you think you'd do?
It's been a long week.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
We found that we had lost our way.
It can't possibly work.
Thanks to you, I spent all my money.
What have we gotten ourselves into?
She demanded to see the manager.
We should sometimes pause to think.
The weather is terrible.
We'll camp here.
Tom really needs our help.
He came here to help me.
You're so sweet.
I refuse to allow this.
I think Tom is incompetent.

I'm dying for a cold drink.
I'm not insane.
Did you eat anything?
I hadn't planned to tell you.
I haven't slept for days.
You're a good guitarist. "I'd like to think I am."
Would you mind if we left?
I'm going to give you one more chance.
You're going to laugh.
At first, I couldn't understand anything.
I want to play, too.
I packed your suitcase for you.
I just got your email.
She came to see me the other day.
Can I see your notebook?
I'd like you to go to the supermarket and buy some bread.
How did you get into my house?
I never meant for any of this to happen.
You're out of time.
Don't move, please.
I'm lucky.
Tom was escorted out of the building by security guards.
Don't rock the boat.
Please help me get a taxi.
I was so unhappy.
Hurry! We don't have a lot of time.
Her friends waited for her by the gate.
Was that a squirrel?
Don't open your umbrella in the hall.

I'm already full, thank you.
I have needs.
How was today's game?
You are the very man I want to see.
Let's take a tea break.
Tom congratulated Mary on her graduation.
You speak French, right?
You're in over your head.

You don't need to know.
You can see that the architect paid scrupulous attention to detail.
Do seedless watermelons exist?
She lost a book.
Stay out of my way!
He worked for a rich man.
Tom's response was immediate.
I like talking to people.
They smiled at each other.
I have to stop that. It's a bad habit.
Did you meet someone else?
I'm wondering if I love Tom.
I am near the station.
Don't smile.
Don't you think it odd that she was in such a hurry?
So what do you suggest?
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
Nothing is more pleasant than to take a walk on a fine spring day.
I want you to know what really happened.
Tom and Mary split up after their son died.
We don't want to cause any trouble.
His lectures are very long.
We're not moving.
Don't ask me to help.
We've said our goodbyes.
That's not quite what I meant.
She majors in child psychology.
What color is your hair?
Tom goes to work by bicycle.
I'll be grateful if you can do that for me.
You didn't eat much lunch, did you?
Who is the woman dressed in pink?
Would you like to go shopping tomorrow?
If I had more money, I could move to a bigger house.
He is subject to fits of anger.
I'll lend you the tools that you need to do that.
His jokes had us in stitches.
Search the house.
He stayed at the hotel for two days.
I came to wish you good luck.
You can't have understood what he said.
I'll come with you.
Where is today's paper?
You can use my bicycle.
To try to bring it back would be foolish.
I asked Tom to come yesterday, but he didn't come.
Tom admitted that he was scared.
I work two jobs.
We would like to leave.
This new Macintosh computer puts the competition to shame.
Please let me know when dinner's ready.
My wife is a good manager.
What time does the train for New York depart?
Parents can pass many diseases on to their offspring.
Who did you learn it from?
She knelt beside him and asked him what his name was.
Why are you blaming us?
Snails move slowly.
It's all part of their strategy.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
I'm in love with somebody else.
You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you'll never convince me.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
Tom pulled the rope.
I want them to be your friends.
That's how I got to know her.
This is the town where he was born.
Take mine.
You are wearing your shirt inside out.
Mother bought me the book.
Only a handful of people know the fact.
That's not my thing.
Was it a joke?
Why don't you grow up?
This won't happen again.
The only thing that matters is whether or not your teacher thinks your report is good enough.
I figured out a way to make more money.
You must take care of yourself.
Do you know what he did?
Give me a second chance.
He says his son can count up to 100 now.
That country's economy is growing.
You have been warned.
I've seen too much.
Tom's home.
I hurried home.
Do you have any CDs?
That would be unfair.
I'm a dancer.
You love that house, don't you?
I'm a Japanese teacher.
I think that's a good sign.
You should assume that anything you do online is public.
Carry this.
I was shocked to see this.
How many children do you have?
I'm just curious.
It's up to you to get to school on time.
I would die for you.
It's a present for you.
May I speak to you for a moment?
I don't intend to marry him.
She doesn't want to talk to me now, and I don't know why.
I am interested in Asian history.
Can I talk to you for a second please?
What you need is a friend.
We tried them all.
There's nothing that can stop us now.
I've come here to work with Tom.
After taking a bath, Tom ate dinner.
He is a kind boy.
A week has seven days.
We all sang in unison.
Make it smaller.
Sorry, we don't accept credit cards.
Stay positive.
You'd better take care of it.
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
I saw my reflection in the window.
She can't ride a bicycle.
You will need an armed escort.
How did she get to know so much about fish?
Excuse me, I dropped my chopsticks.
I don't have any comment on that.
I just needed some water.
We don't speak French at home.
I'll go first.
The British had military bases along New York's Hudson River.
I believe things will get better.
She spends way too much time surfing the web.
She treated him very well.
Which party do you belong to?
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
I finally broke down and bought the game my son had been asking me for.
It's cold.
Am I under suspicion here?
I changed that.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
How about running?
Who told you the story?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
People are saying that the crisis is over.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.
What is at issue in this debate is the survival of our planet.
She is not afraid to die.
I learn a lot from my father.
You don't scare me anymore.
They don't like you.
I moved back in with my parents.
I've got no time for that.
I would like to thank you for accepting my invitation.
Tom broke the rules and was kicked off the team.
I remembered it.
You can't say no.
I've paid parking fines a number of times myself.
Tom wanted me to give you this.
I saw her again.
I'm glad you're here with me.
Stop right there.
In the summer, the temperature ranges from thirty to forty degrees Celsius.
His accomplishments speak for themselves.
Do you trust her?
I was invited.
He ignored me.
This message turned out to be a little hard for me to write.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
Yesterday my bicycle was stolen while I was doing some shopping.
One of my bags is missing.
Who's taking responsibility for this?
I've got to leave soon.
I'm not very athletic.
My sister has made remarkable progress in English.
He caught a large trout.
These pictures were painted by him.
People don't always tell the truth.
I was quite shocked by this.
Tom went home at 6:30.
He entered junior high school.
I'm already married.
No matter how sneaky you are, you can never surprise yourself.
How am I doing so far?
I can't understand it.
I'm sure Tom did his best.
I want you to destroy all this.
Home prices are surging.
Go away before they see you here.
You look smart.
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy.
My painting is starting to look pretty cool.
Who did he see?
We need to maintain focus.
You know the drill.
Are you trying to tell me something?
He has a hairy chest.
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
We gave the car a push.
I can't remember it.
Are you healthy?
I don't know why I have to do this.
At first, everything seemed difficult.
I'm pretty busy.
I come here every day.
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
There is no film in this camera.
I didn't even bring a jacket.
He works as a ghost writer.
The environment must be protected.
You can sleep on the couch.
Had you been drinking?
You're not dead.
Why are you so clumsy?
She is a particularily interesting person.
We were taught that World War II broke out in 1939.
Tom often goes shopping alone.
I love American food.
They say he's sick.
I like working.
There's a problem with the plane's landing gear.
The bar was packed.
It's amazing that he won the championship at the age of nineteen.
Only 514 people have been in space.
I miss her a lot.
Why don't you leave Tom?
I hate to waste my time.
I really enjoyed last night.
When was the last time that you did something for the first time?
It would make a great Christmas present.
Nice shot!
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Aren't there any risks?
Can't you speak French?
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today.
I've got things to do.
We haven't been to Boston in a long time.
Can you cash this check for me?
Will you glance through this report?
I found her very amusing.
So far as this matter is concerned, I am completely satisfied.
I ate too much.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
Tom isn't a doctor.
The surgeon persuaded me to undergo an organ transplant operation.
She is ashamed to speak up.
I'm not leaving without you.
Were you one of them?
I got up early the next morning to catch the first train.
I've finished eating.
Why don't you just study a little harder?
I come from Japan.
He enlisted in the Foreign Legion.
It's a bit wobbly.
Don't throw away your chance.
I think that wouldn't be a good idea.
We have a new coach and some new players.
Someone left the water running.
I wanted to marry him.
I hate that more than anything.
Things got weird.
Why is he busy?
I don't know how to reach you.
I have to practice the piano every day.
I will go there even if it rains.
There were soldiers on these ships.
I underestimated you.
I was planning to do my homework, but I fell asleep.
Bill Gates is the world's richest man.
I can't do this job without you.
I need someone to hold me.
What will happen to her?
You don't seem to want to come with us.
When did you do this?
The car stopped.
There is no smoke without fire.
There are seven men and four women in my section.
The room was dark.
The boy remained silent.
Where did I put that box?
I keep saying that I'm innocent, but no one will listen.
I hope to hear from you.
Thank you in advance for your help.
I enjoy music.
I'll take those.
I know that Tom is a bit chubby.
They fell into each other's arms.
Continue working.
Tom lied to all of us.
I stayed home to rest.
There's no way to get in touch with him.
Let's just drop the subject, OK?
On my way to the library I met my friend.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I did everything I could to help Tom find a job.
He ran off with his best friend's wife and hasn't been heard from since.
Do you like cooking?
That's just not acceptable.
You like olives, don't you?
Which cap is yours?
He won't come, will he?
He was scared when the monkey jumped at him.
Pay what you want.
I'm getting off at the next stop.
Tom knows too much.
You're not good at this.
I'd like you to help me gather some firewood.
You have friends who can help you, don't you?
You said you were happy.
Who do you know here?
I made a regrettable mistake.
When was your first love?
I don't regret a thing.
The treaty did not ban nuclear tests under the ground.
I decided to try again.
You've made your point.
He said he would write to me, but he hasn't.
Kids can be so mean.
I'd like something to drink.
I knew I wasn't crazy.
Someone has to do it.
Do you really think Tom is the only one here who can speak French?
Let Tom decide.
It tastes like chicken.
Write down each word.
This is quite shocking.
Don't make me come back here.
There were a lot of murders last year.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
Aren't you going to say something?
Australia is no exception.
My friends did that without me.
An amputation is needed.
If I knew what to do, I'd be doing it.
Everyone in town knows his name.
I wrote to him for quite another reason.
Have you ever eaten oysters?
I think what Tom is doing is terrific.
You're very timid.
My sister is very intelligent.
Tell me it's not true.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
Who did this to you?
My dream is to be a baseball player.
In 1958, Brazil won its first World Cup victory.
You are tired, aren't you?
It goes without saying that nobody can come between us.
I remember that day clearly.
My girlfriend was crying.
Do you believe in miracles?
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
I'm not sure why.
What book did you buy?
This child believes that the earth is flat.
They tried to cheer me up.
I like traveling.
I hope you'll come back soon.
Let me tell you about our special.
I have a problem with that.
It was not my intention.
Did I say something stupid?
You're a monster.
You're not bleeding.
The kids will be happy to see you.
I don't believe this.
I warned you once.
They're all fake.
Tom opened the car door to get in.
We need it now more than ever.
Mary said that Tom was smarter than she was.
What do you want for breakfast?
A woman appeared from behind a tree.
How good are you?
This is true love.
Are you close to your family?
You may stay here with me.
She has a very strong personality.
I went to Disneyland yesterday.
She seems timid, but she's actually a strong-willed person.
Tom will come this afternoon.
You can buy whichever you like, but not both.
I'd like to know what this is all about.
All our plans went wrong.
That's all that's necessary.
I almost dropped a plate.
He was a brave soldier.
I do not know exactly.
You're wasting water.
How many sandwiches are there left?
It's a rental.
Tom is allergic to peanuts.
I made myself a turkey sandwich.
This fact must not be forgotten.
You could do it if you really wanted to.
I've been following you.
I just woke up a few minutes ago.
You're the oldest.
Thank you for all your help.
How do you expect me to pay this?
They're young and healthy.
It's like being in a candy shop.
Yesterday was hot.
You'll get there in time, as long as you don't miss the train.
I laughed when Tom told me he was planning to get married.
I have a job for you.
I think you know what you should do.
He took out one egg.
Don't you smell something burning in the kitchen?
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
I really enjoy spending time with you.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
Come help me.
I thought I'd surprise you.
We'll all be there.
I gave them a present for their anniversary.
Please make us some tea.
The store was not a big one, was it?
You've been there before, haven't you?
Go and get me some wine.
What've you been doing today?
Would you mind if I smoke?
She was very beautiful when she was young.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Do you remember what you did last Friday?
The loss adds up to more than one million dollars.
When is he coming back?
I can't put up with the way he spits.
He'll get over it.
He frequently jumps from one topic to another while he is talking.
She screamed with terror.
News of the recent blast is all over the radio.
That's what you do, isn't it?
That was then and this is now.
You're satisfied.
Why can't I move?
I like my teachers.
The Japanese embassy has warned Japanese citizens to be careful.
It's really not that heavy.
We couldn't stop him from hitting her.
I work in this building.
You owe me an apology.
He turned the corner.
Don't trust him.
I already called him.
You'd better not drink too much coffee so late at night.
Give me a cup of coffee.
I still don't understand what you're talking about.
You deserve a medal.
You weren't married for long, were you?
Guess who else moved to Boston.
Who is on the train?
My son wants to be a professional golfer.
I only want to help you.
He delivered a speech.
I'm spontaneous.
I'll marry you.
Should I fill in this form now?
How come you know so much?
Tom did something strange.
Do you see why this is a problem?
Why did you like it?
They smiled.
I teach French.
What time is it now?
During the war, people went through many hardships.
They eat meat once a week.
I don't need your help anymore.
Tom told Mary an interesting story.
It was a good idea.
The recent shortage of coffee has given rise to a lot of problems.
How many letters are there in the English alphabet?
Few people live to be a hundred.
Which season do you like the best?
Thanks to both of you.
This is love.
Who is the woman dressed in pink?
You'll lose everything.
He lied to my face.
I don't know if I can do this.
If I told you, you wouldn't understand.
I'm sorry. I got the wrong number.
I wrote this song just for you.
Can I eat in my room?
She danced with joy.
Let's forget the whole thing, OK?
The game is over.
We can all walk home.
Why don't we do this later?
I appreciate you being here.
Are you sure you're all right?
He always left the problem of his children's education to his wife.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I think you'd better leave now.
He can't know the truth.
Have you ever seen a film this good?
They gathered at the coffee shop for a meeting.
Who taught you how to dance?
Tom doesn't understand a thing.
This is yours, isn't it?
Nobody showed up today.
Is Tom from Boston?
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
It was easy for me to do so.
Come to my house at eight.
She has no fear.
It's nice to see you again.
Don't try that at home.
I'm going to New York next week.
Someone has stolen all my money.
I'm already bored.
How can you be sure of that?
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
I have not seen him for a long time.
She didn't want him to play poker.
I want something sweet.
They stood on the top of the hill.
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is go there without your permission.
That's a risk you have to take.
It was sunny this morning.
Do you think that's significant?
He inherited the house.
What don't you want me to do?
Your demands are unreasonable.
We can't all be perfect.
Are these your daughters?
Did you buy a return ticket?
I wore a hat yesterday because it was very cold.
I hope you'll get well soon.
Do you have a temperature?
Fur provides animals protection against the cold.
It is a pity that he can't come.
Can you please walk away?
He's a nervous wreck.
I've got things to say.
Tom and Mary don't get along.
Is there anyone in the room?
I think Tom wants to see you.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
I need more power.
He ordered them to release the prisoner.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
You look like you're busy.
Millions of people starve to death every year.
I totally believe you.
I thought you didn't like romance movies.
Wow! It's been a long time.
There's one problem with this.
I'm no fool.
I figured I might find you here.
Would you care for more coffee?
We can't just leave Tom here by himself.
I didn't know what to do with it.
As soon as I can get a decent video camera, I'll start making videos to put online.
The station is nearby.
I'll do everything that I can.
Try to go slower.
She put it in the box.
The noise kept me awake all night.
I have no will power when it comes to dieting.
We chartered a bus.
One cannot embrace the unembraceable.
I'm not tired.
The picture brought back a lot of memories.
Tom drives too fast.
What are you talking about?
If the university doesn't have enough students, the administration will cancel the class.
Tom can be relied on.
I'm not hungry anymore.
Nothing unexpected happened.
Tom was sent back to Boston.
What's your favorite lipstick color?
He is my old friend.
I hear you're good at French.
Tom was silent for a moment.
We're waiting for the right time.
Tom and I've just gotten married.
I had a headache, so I couldn't do that.
You're unambitious.
They got it.
How bad is the damage?
I want to talk to you about this report.
Tell me about your plan.
Would you like me to massage your shoulders?
These books are heavy.
My plan is working perfectly.
Promise me that you'll help Tom.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
I think we should stop now.
He speaks Japanese as if he were Japanese.
I just want to be your friend.
She made the same mistake as before.
Attention please!
Why is the bus late?
I didn't think you were home.
Take a chance.
They didn't swim because it was cold.
I'll figure something out.
I think Tom is cheating.
We're one of the best teams in the world.
There's something about him that just doesn't sit right with me.
That's quite a story.
They will be safe with her.
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
Promise me you won't to do anything stupid.
Tom did exactly as I told him to do.
He couldn't go out because of the snow.
Leave me a message, please.
You should write it down before you forget it.
The three brothers must help one another.
We lost the game.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
The unthinkable happened.
His joke made us all laugh.
They're expressing their love by hugging.
Isn't that true?
We're so glad to have you here.
I think you must be getting tired.
Tom didn't say a word to me.
I'm rather surprised to hear it.
I just told him.
She was advised by him to come back at once.
Robert Deniro made a cameo appearance in the movie.
I said that wasn't what I meant.
He's not sure he's ready.
They live in this town.
It's a pity they're getting divorced.
I remember when it happened.
Do you like robots?
You can fix all this.
This game is easy.
I think we're going to need more money.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
Are you sure you're up for it?
He was reluctant to answer.
Drop your weapons!
I exchanged a camera for a guitar.
It falls to you to put the finishing touches to this work.
Is your mother here?
Christmas is a magical time of the year.
He ran too fast for me to keep up with him.
I sat down next to him.
Tom isn't a lazy child.
The water is cold.
What kind of music do you like?
You're safe.
We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I have one.
He must have seen it.
The atmosphere in this restaurant is nice.
They argue a lot, but for the most part they get along quite well together.
Did you hurt yourself?
Have you read the book Tom bought for you?
This box is made of tin.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
I think maybe you've made a mistake.
This movie is frightening to the children.
That is what I want to know.
Don't make me say it.
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
The situation is desperate.
She smiled at him.
It's just a phone.
You've been busy, haven't you?
I've done everything you've asked.
I am leaving at ten o'clock.
We sometimes make mistakes.
Do whatever it takes to get the job done.
Do you mind if I open the window and let the smoke out?
Tom doesn't drink coffee.
He is a good loser.
Tom was sitting alone in his room.
My work is done.
What is your house like?
We now know what the rules are.
Tom will be angry if Mary does that.
I have a slight headache now.
I finally understand the basic principles of calculus.
I have come in response to your ad in the paper.
All my friends say that.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
The job looked quite simple, but it took me a week.
I love being alone.
I'm just doing my job.
It doesn't happen very often.
Every dog has his day.
That's real nice of you.
Tom is much older than he looks.
He was present at the meeting.
Taking a hot bath helps me take my mind off my worries.
Tom eats a lot of Chinese food.
What station is it?
He never breaks promises.
I knew you'd come back to me.
I have to warn him.
I think his life is in danger.
We heard a gunshot.
Tom said that he couldn't sleep at all last night.
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
He's feeling really low.
Give me all the details.
She sat there silently with tears in her eyes.
Did you do your homework?
Give me one good reason.
Is this the reason you didn't want me to come?
What kind of car are you driving?
Everything is on schedule.
The mountains are reflected in the lake.
Tom came half an hour late.
What's the oldest thing you own?
Tom says he's climbed this mountain three times.
He and I are kindred spirits.
I agree with your opinion.
You're a dreamer.
We went to the beach together.
I just followed your instructions.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
The pain still hasn't gone away.
My sister is not a high school student.
We communicated with each other by gesture.
Whatever he says goes.
She is friendly to everybody.
He dedicated himself to research.
Have you ever played golf?
She put on her new dress for the party.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
Tom began reading that book three weeks ago and he still has only read less than half of it.
I appreciate your suggestion.
It was cloudy, with occasional rain.
Tom is good at biology.
When I bite down, this tooth hurts.
It takes 165 years for Neptune to orbit around the sun.
What's the deal here?
Tom'll come.
I guess that's possible.
I've been silent for a long time.
I don't enjoy tennis.
People shouldn't abuse animals.
Tom doesn't know how strong you are.
We partied all night long.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Her speech moved the audience.
I tricked you.
We have to figure out a way to get out of here alive.
I don't know the reason for her absence.
I couldn't lie to you.
I'm only going to say this once.
She visits him quite often, but never stays very long.
I sent you an email.
Open these doors.
His music is too noisy.
Watch the front.
Please pour me a little tea.
Normally this would be funny.
Don't watch too much TV.
Lend him as much money as he needs.
I must pass this exam, no matter what.
I ran as fast as I could to catch the train.
Stay away from my daughter!
Ask around.
I know you're in there somewhere.
He was scolded by his teacher for being lazy.
She had a strange hat on.
I want us all under one roof again.
Is it cruel to declaw your cat?
I was just making sure.
What's so hard to believe?
I have to be punished.
Can't you speak French?
He is studying agriculture.
I suppose you'll be studying all day tomorrow.
I'll go this way.
You were seventh.
I know this isn't hard.
Japan is not rich in natural resources.
You must do your best.
I hope you will be completely cured.
I'm one of your employees.
I didn't hear you.
I suppose you're hungry.
We know very little about the cause of this disease.
Stop playing hard to get.
We're getting close.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
I owe you one.
At last, I caught up with my friends.
I don't know how long.
We don't know why he had to leave.
That was three months ago.
He didn't get caught.
I remember the horror I felt when she screamed.
I don't spend much time at home.
School is not a waste of time.
How did you get these?
I'm sure you're going to like this.
I should've been able to do that by myself.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
He promoted the idea of world government.
I have a few dollars.
There was no place to buy food.
Tom missed the bus.
I am waiting for the store to open.
It was not an accident.
I couldn't tell Tom what was going to happen.
I'm not good enough for you.
The quality of their products has gone down over the years.
So, are you seeing anyone?
Hold that thought.
I killed the mosquito.
It snowed a lot last year.
I've decided.
I have your schedule here.
She refused to take the money.
Watch the road.
He needs you.
I don't like snow.
That should be enough for you.
We buy stationery in bulk.
I'm so sick of this.
That's why I love you.
I'll meet you outside.
She gathered the pieces of the broken dish.
Do I look busy to you?
I'll be absent for a week.
You're very astute.
I accompanied her on a walk.
Tom is my brother.
Hurry up, and you'll catch the bus.
We arrived three days ago.
My grandfather has snowy white hair.
I had a really weird dream yesterday.
I am boiling water.
He plays the piano very well.
Tom is an electrician.
Tom shouldn't spend so much.
She married a local boy.
I'm the one who makes the decisions.
My neighbor renovated his house completely.
Where are those prisoners?
That's good for a first try.
Tom cut the wrong wire.
Our teacher seldom laughs.
The fuse has blown.
I don't want to see it.
My wife died of cancer.
If you want to come, you can.
Paris is the capital of France.
She snuck out the house without him knowing.
That toy is made of wood.
Am I wrong about that?
Let's go get snockered like we did last weekend.
Would you speak more slowly, please?
She was dressed in red.
Are we friends?
I forgave you a long time ago.
I need some volunteers.
My wife was mad.
How are you going to pay for this?
Somebody tipped off the gang members to the police surveillance.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
She availed herself of every opportunity.
Are you famous?
How are you connected?
It's not that nice.
He'll be here around four o'clock.
How long have you been busy?
If for some reason I'm late, please don't wait for me.
I'd like to hear you sing your new song.
Roll down your window.
Why do people go to the movies?
I'm glad the kids weren't hurt.
I think you lied to me.
Do you have a fishing license?
Language is the means by which people communicate with others.
I don't see anybody dancing.
Do you have a sec?
You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
I love poetry.
The students are sitting in a circle.
Could I see your papers?
There's a simple solution to this problem.
She got caught.
He came back from America.
You don't seem too sure.
You're not upset, are you?
He sees nothing wrong with it.
I never get sick of dancing.
I will get in touch with you.
Don't leave things half finished.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
How can I tell if I'm really in love?
Are you afraid of the dark?
I can't express myself in French very well.
It took me a long time to do my homework last night.
We have less than three minutes left.
I found it easy to answer the question.
You're very helpful.
Come to my room between three and four.
He decided to quit smoking.
Don't lie. Be honest.
I don't like it when you dance with Tom.
I feel empowered.
Don't hurt anybody else.
Remove your hat.
Tom gave us lots to eat.
He often eats out on Saturday nights.
How much did you pay for the dress?
Oh no, not again!
I worked hard.
I object to her going there alone.
There was something.
I need a new bicycle.
I know what it's like to be the new guy.
I locked myself in my room.
He was lucky.
Are you at work?
Would you carry this down to the second floor for me?
We are having a good time.
I want to see them again.
I really can't take it anymore.
I didn't hear you come in.
Tom is new.
Can I get you a drink?
He gave us quite a lot of trouble.
Do you know a better way to do this?
Why can't I see you?
Tom isn't cooperative.
We've made a deal.
Tom enjoys playing computer games.
I know you want to make me happy.
I'm tired of writing.
He fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
How much will all this cost?
He is bankrupt.
You look perfect.
I want you to tell Tom that I love him.
You will survive.
You're too old for me.
I have enough money to buy it.
He did the work against his will.
Keep out.
Publication of the article was timed to coincide with the professor's birthday.
The balloon is filled with air.
Tom is home alone.
He abandoned his hope of becoming a doctor.
Tom didn't see it.
You aren't in a hurry, are you?
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
Remove your hat.
That will cost you a lot of money.
That's the computer on which he writes his articles.
That would take all day.
I need you to believe me.
Be quiet, or the baby will wake up.
Is Tom sure?
I'm going to rewrite this report.
I'll sign the petition.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
Here's a picture of my baby.
I wasn't satisfied.
You'll be all right.
It's not funny.
The national debt is growing.
His uncle died five years ago.
Who would you like to speak to?
You broke my nose.
I'll leave when she comes back.
I don't have any close friends.
Do you have a pen I could use?
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
Where do you get your hair done?
I guess that'll be up to you.
He had a good look at the papers.
I'm in a hurry today.
Am I making sense?
Evil always wins.
Do you have a crowbar in your toolbox?
Tom didn't seem to be aware that he was supposed to do that.
Tom told me I was wrong.
You don't have to come see me.
Did you buy a nice bicycle?
I am a university student.
I forgot you don't like carrots.
It was a computer error.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Tom still needs practice.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
How can I repay you?
Be nicer to your brother.
We probably don't have enough money to buy that.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
We all know Tom is guilty.
How can you be so callous?
The hotel was burned down.
She is an obstinate girl.
He made a mistake on purpose.
They found the stolen money.
I was careful not to do that.
I went to get vaccinated.
We're out of tissue paper, so I need to go buy some.
A note was attached to the document with a paper clip.
Take this medicine after each meal.
Who is this letter from?
What exactly are we paying for?
He studies very hard.
Can you give me another sentence to translate?
You're probably tired.
The price reflects the demand.
I am married and I have two sons.
She talked him into accepting the bribe.
I'm glad you appreciated that.
They haven't arrived yet.
Have you told anyone else about this?
You look so handsome.
His debts amount to two million dollars.
Tom doesn't remember if he locked the door.
Don't ask questions, just come with me.
This is taking forever.
Our priorities are wrong.
My mother allowed me to go abroad.
I saw my mother hide the cake.
Here's the key to your room.
My cat is suffering from the heat.
Please turn up the radio.
Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
It started to rain.
What was it for?
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
Did you not know that?
They have no natural predators.
I often catch colds in the winter.
This is so much fun.
He's a very hard worker.
Tom showed us his photo album.
They regarded the man as a danger to society.
A car went by.
We must follow the regulations.
I hope he will come up with a new and good idea.
I recommend a thorough checkup for your husband.
They saw him enter the room.
I'm afraid it's not so easy.
The car replaced the bicycle.
Tell them to call me before they leave.
This car is too expensive.
Tom dressed himself quickly, then ran out the door.
Is this good French?
Are you getting paid for this?
He's too trusting.
Do you want to go shopping with me?
I couldn't get that lucky.
I don't know who's coming.
She cannot have understood what you said.
Could you tell me what's going on?
Tom is on his deathbed.
I will be pleased to help you.
Tom is not able to drive a car.
He has money.
It doesn't matter to me whether you come or not.
Do you honestly believe that?
I've been waiting for him for an hour.
You're unambitious.
The car cut to the left.
I feel the same way as you do.
I have nothing in particular to say about this problem.
The pickpocket disappeared into the crowd.
She spoke out strongly against cruelty to animals.
You're early.
Tom refused to sing the song Mary requested.
Did you forget something?
When did you buy it?
What is your type exactly?
We trust him.
He was crushed to death.
Instead of cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
This is the watch that I'd lost.
I lost my travelers checks.
A calamity was avoided by sheer luck.
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
Do you enjoy living like this?
Let me help you. Your bag looks very heavy.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I owe him a debt.
Please make yourself comfortable.
I like the color green.
I didn't get your name.
Tom loves potatoes.
Ten is ten percent of one hundred.
You aren't busy now, are you?
Do you really think Tom is better than me?
The house is warm.
You can't cancel the meeting.
The stamp came off.
Where can I take a bath?
Refer to the Users' Guide if you have any problems.
I wasn't looking at you.
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
Can I talk to you in private?
The lovers fell into each other's arms every chance they got.
It's a quote from the book.
Football is my favorite game.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Are you ready to party?
I should call the police and have you arrested.
It's noisy next door.
We were both drunk.
You're forgetful.
She gave him a few pointers on pronunciation.
They hunted foxes.
Why have you been avoiding me?
That's how I came to know her.
You're the last person I expected to see here.
I recommend it highly.
The guys are playing basketball.
Come in, the door's open.
How can I help you?
You still haven't told me who he is.
You must've had a very hard day.
Tom bought a shirt yesterday.
If something is wrong, tell me.
Everyone thinks the same thing.
Can't you help us?
Since he didn't know what to say, he remained silent.
I sprang out of bed.
Parents were hopeful about the future.
Is this the train station?
I doubt that Tom is happy with his new job.
It's all settled.
You can't live like this.
You don't have to apologize.
Everyone's someplace else.
Tom's not a nice guy.
You don't know me at all.
She is married to a foreigner.
According to our teacher, she entered the hospital.
We aren't as old as Tom is.
Where do I have to change trains?
Why are you so cheerful?
I'd like to build a new house.
Tom knocked on Mary's door.
Human remains were found during the excavation.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you to do.
This is really humiliating.
He speaks English with a German accent.
We argued politics.
Even I don't understand.
Don't worry about me so much.
Have you seen my son?
It is no use asking me for money.
I am on good terms with my brother.
Have you sold it yet?
I can't bend my right arm.
These facts support my hypothesis.
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
That's only a temporary solution.
We'll get in touch with you as soon as possible.
I thought they wouldn't come.
It's not safe.
You have no evidence.
Hey, you two! What are you doing?
Eat up all your spinach!
She turned pale at the news.
I'll take the stairs.
The ball bounced up high.
You're in danger, too.
I only read the first three chapters.
I'm done listening to you.
That's just my opinion.
You're weak.
The whole class was quiet.
Drive safely.
He seems not to be aware of the conflict between my father and me.
Come on, help me.
What a small world!
Listen carefully.
Yesterday night, I shared a cab with Paris Hilton.
You'll have to work hard if you want to pass the exam.
We'll be making an announcement shortly.
How long are we just going to sit here?
My father died before I was born.
His ideas are based on his experience.
Tom has a high IQ.
Nobody knows what it is that has been bothering him so much.
He has one dog and six cats.
Does that make sense to you?
She made him a cake for his party.
Are you almost here?
I'm right behind you.
I knew you could do it.
How long did Tom work here?
Do you know what I mean?
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
I wasn't going to give up.
I have to talk to you alone.
Jesus loves you.
I've messed up.
She's not as tall as him.
You are a workaholic.
He married his high school sweetheart.
He slept well last night.
I don't know how you stayed in that job all this time.
She doesn't need to go there herself.
I found a solution.
I haven't really made up my mind yet.
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
Tom always travels by car.
I'm very grateful for your help.
I thought we'd be safe here.
Let me pay.
Tom said he wanted those.
I should've thought of this before.
I don't answer stupid questions.
Are you fond of music?
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
He will not listen to me.
I feel relaxed with you.
I dove into the river.
Tom didn't seem to be that busy.
Tom works at a nearby restaurant.
I explained the accident to him.
You don't belong here.
I can't believe we're going to lose.
Should we wait?
Did you notice that Tom wasn't wearing his wedding ring today?
I didn't realize you were serious.
I want to sit by the window.
Can you read French?
I started learning Chinese last week.
You were clearly mistaken.
I've got some rather serious news.
This is too short.
I think I did something wrong.
I would consider Boston a very big city.
How can you say such a foolish thing?
Lie down and make yourself comfortable.
It's not always possible to eat well when you're traveling in this part of the world.
I saw her taking a walk in the park at midnight.
That's altogether wrong.
What're you saying?
I'll work as long as I live.
I don't feel like getting up.
I had no notion that you were coming.
What do you think you're doing letting the loyalists into the castle?
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
I'm going to study French next year.
I promised him to keep it secret.
I agree with Tom, too.
My uncle runs a hotel.
Everything was paid for.
Smell this.
I'd like to buy a good dictionary.
The committee consists of fifteen people.
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
It's a beautiful story.
Can you give me your telephone number, please?
Can I have your phone number?
Tom takes very good care of his car.
You're taller than I am.
Tom was your guitar teacher, wasn't he?
You need to come.
Do you like the taste of beer?
I like spring the best of the seasons.
He warned us not to enter the room.
He puts ten dollars aside every week.
It's on fire.
What kind of stone is this?
Be quiet and listen.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
Let's not overreact.
We want to make everybody happy.
You're a doll!
She is taller than her sister.
Tom and Mary are vegetarians.
A storm is brewing.
I don't see how I can help you.
I only have one so far.
I'd like to write a book.
She's a tough one.
Does that work for you?
I believe what he says.
I really do like Christmas.
He went there instead of me.
You've found it.
I need a crew.
What do you say to calling it a day?
A jack of all trades is a master of none.
We're married now.
I must go.
Tom hurried out of the building.
The rescue party searched for the missing passengers.
I have to win.
That's what I really want.
Tom's mom is very strict.
I don't think Tom knows Mary is here.
You're a true friend.
Tom doesn't have to wait.
This tastes moldy.
Where are they going to go?
What do they do with all their leisure time?
He has a brother and two sisters.
He brought me back in his car.
I made muffins.
You've got paint on you.
Would you chill out?
I can't make it.
I didn't know you were from Boston.
Where can I get a ticket?
Tom put his ear to the door in an effort to overhear what Mary was saying on the phone.
Tom likes writing.
You can go there.
There's something I feel you should know.
Tom is listening now.
Do you want to use mine?
I will shoot him.
I can't stand it any longer.
He felt himself seized by a strong arm from behind.
I will go to the meeting.
Tell me what I have to do.
We're moving next month.
I don't know who won.
You're still young.
The other one doesn't work.
I appreciate it.
I have a lot to do today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to have this discussion at another time.
I'm supposed to be the one helping you.
His brother was lost in the town.
Mary is the prettiest girl in her class.
You're a mean old woman.
Tom dripped with sweat.
I really love modern art.
I have just arrived here.
I haven't written for a long time.
I'm thorough.
Englishmen are, on the whole, conservative.
The fact that I'm here proves that I'm innocent.
Tom is obviously very brave.
I've heard of you.
We have plenty of work to do this morning.
He cherished the memory of his dead wife.
I'll lend you the money, but mind you, this is the last time.
In case anything happens, call me immediately.
Let me think for a while.
Would you mind closing the door behind you?
Is there anything you want to tell us?
I accept your offer.
He may come today.
I found these.
I was just about to come looking for you.
You should study harder.
Choose the one you like.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
I'm laying you off.
She talked to the chairman.
I know you miss Tom.
Why do you lie?
How far are you prepared to go?
I got bored.
I don't have much choice.
I appreciate all you did.
I can talk to him for hours.
Please speak more slowly.
I can't think of everything.
Why don't you go to school with us?
He let me go.
She ran as fast as she was able to.
I ran away in a hurry.
He let his books fall to the floor.
Draw a picture of yourself.
I'm happy you liked it.
Give us a minute, OK?
I hate this rug.
This fish has a bad smell.
I wish that I could have spent more time with my father before he died.
We don't even need this.
Tell me where you went.
This is your house now.
I am a gentleman's daughter.
I need an envelope.
What has he done?
Please show me another camera.
Who coaches the team?
I stayed at a nice hotel.
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
My plan for the summer is to go to Europe.
I had to do everything alone.
I only saw him once.
When were potatoes introduced into Japan?
What were you thinking?
What a big dog!
I want things the way they were.
I'm married and I have a daughter.
Do you want to use mine?
The old man was run over and immediately taken to hospital.
There is a risk.
I think you look really great.
I had a lot on my mind.
Tom works in advertising.
Everybody is very busy.
I'm not surprised that Tom did that.
What time will you have breakfast?
I'm used to it.
Did you really think I'd dance with you?
He hurt his knee when he fell.
I don't think I can do that.
I like to finish what I start.
They all look the same.
It's almost time.
The Americans did not like the new plan.
It looks like you've got a green thumb.
The cuffs of his suit jacket are badly frayed.
I hardly got any sleep last night.
You can't sit there.
We're both writers.
I'd like a hotel reservation.
Help Tom to load the truck.
Did you get the check?
I had to see it for myself.
What was your relationship with your father like when you were a kid?
I don't think I want to answer any more of your questions right now.
Tom can run faster than you.
I hid under the table.
Sing us a song.
Maybe that'll be enough.
You're right, I think.
The Republican candidate won the election.
Our guests have arrived.
The children made sculptures out of wire.
How did it get there?
He held out his hand to me.
Why wouldn't you listen to his advice?
You have a pretty good memory.
He followed my advice.
It would be nice to get married.
Nobody contacted me.
I went to Nagasaki.
My right hand is numb.
Can you ski?
Is that your car in the driveway?
Please fill in your name and address on this form.
Words cannot convey my feelings.
I don't hate you.
I know you think there's no hope.
That's all I remember.
How many pictures did you buy?
What kind of music does Tom listen to?
That was a month ago.
I haven't got rid of my bad cold yet.
I was caught in a shower on my way home.
I'm tired.
I really ought to go.
If we had more money, we'd do that.
It's only worth three dollars.
He'll return at six.
I promise I'll take good care of your dog.
Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?
That's how I see it.
Whatever you do, don't push that button.
Why are you so pale today?
Which shoes do you like?
It sounds healthy.
Tom is not my son.
Someone parked in my spot.
A few days' rest will do you good.
I am sorry that she is absent from the conference.
I want to buy this material for a new dress. How much does it cost?
If possible, I'd like to see him.
Who broke the chair?
It's a beautiful job.
Stop the car now.
Do you think I'm pretty?
We went too far.
We just got here.
I'm often only half awake.
He makes the most of his opportunities.
I found something interesting in the town.
What'd the doctor say?
We stayed at the Dorchester.
Strawberries are in season now.
Where can I buy stamps?
He started to speak English.
It wasn't any bigger than a soccer ball.
Stay together.
I already know what Tom wants to tell me.
Is Tom ready for this?
In any case, I'll inform you when he comes.
I'm a pretty happy person.
The letter was addressed to me.
Help me and I'll help you.
Do you know anyone who was on that ship that sunk?
I was pretty relaxed.
We can't lose.
I feel sorry for her.
You seem to know everything.
You can drive a car, can't you?
I don't have anything to say to you.
I saved you.
We have to get Tom out of there.
We have a lot to do.
I built this doghouse by myself.
Maybe you're right.
His name is known to everybody in this area.
Do you believe in UFOs?
I loved high school.
Thank you all for being here.
We should be proud of ourselves.
I'll find out what happened.
We've run out of beer.
Have a beer.
Tom is a genius.
Do you want me to teach you some swear words?
It sounds easy.
Tom said he would leave on Monday.
This fruit doesn't taste good.
The king oppressed his people.
Please put the chair away. It is in the way.
Are you wondering what we ended up doing?
She left the room.
You will need a bodyguard.
Guess what I bought today.
I hope you'll be very happy together.
Humans only live about 70 years.
How long did you stay abroad?
You must learn from your mistakes.
I love you both.
Are you volunteering to help?
I know how hard it is to do that.
What's in that bottle?
It just doesn't look right.
She doesn't seem happy.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Tom asked Mary to lend him some money.
It is foggy.
Tom has been quiet all day.
Tom poured himself a cup of coffee.
I just showered.
I found the bed very comfortable.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Why do you need a doctor?
I want to be alone for a while.
I do a lot of things.
The weather was bad this weekend.
I want to hear you scream.
Which dog is yours?
I found a good place to buy fruit a couple of days ago.
Someone is standing behind the bushes taking pictures of us.
You're cuter than Mary.
You are not a child any more.
Thank you for coming early.
Do you come here often?
There is an album on the shelf.
I can't stand staying indoors.
I understand your feelings.
I know I got it right this time.
You can wait for me here.
I always have two cups of coffee in the morning.
No one can achieve anything without effort.
They all joined in the chorus.
Do you like this leather jacket?
She advised him not to believe everything the teacher says.
Can I make copies?
They struggled.
You should get your eyes examined.
Now why would you go and do a stupid thing like that?
If you are to realize your dream, you must work harder.
We have plenty of wine.
When did you meet her?
We're not old.
This is what he said.
I can hardly believe it.
Miyazaki is not what it used to be.
They make a great team.
I don't really need your help.
Tom is getting the results that he hoped for.
Now that he is old, it is your duty to look after him.
That's how it is.
You are twice as strong as me.
He asked after you.
I learned to live without her.
I hope that it is fine tomorrow.
Give me your word that you won't do that.
That was you, wasn't it?
He is the tallest man that I have ever seen.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
The picnic was canceled because of rain.
Tom likes playing tennis, but I don't.
See you tomorrow at school.
There are a lot of girls in the room.
It costs an arm and a leg.
I've got you.
Find the differences.
What happened exactly?
I thought you were going to fix the sink.
Two seats were vacant.
We heard gunshots from next door.
What happened?
They concluded he was lying.
He lived to a ripe old age.
She introduced her sister to him more than two years ago.
They come from the same village.
She bought him a camera that was too big to fit in his shirt pocket.
The rooms are all clean.
I don't know where you are now.
Tom's window was open.
It didn't work for me either.
There's only a day left.
I wish I could figure out how to delete my Facebook account.
She so wants to go.
It is strange that he has not come yet.
He parked his car in front of the building.
I figured I had enough money.
He put this information to good use.
I've upset you.
Where should I sit?
I stayed longer than I thought I would.
You look like you're about to throw up.
He loves attention.
How could they not know?
I like Tom.
You still have a lot to learn.
We are about to leave here.
Let's go to your room.
Poverty is the root of all evil.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
I have to open my shop.
I go to Boston once a month.
Why don't you sit down for a moment?
It's easy to get lost, so please be careful.
Do I look dead to you?
Tom is good at fixing watches.
I found it difficult to convince her.
It's a bad time.
Nowadays anybody can get books.
My uncle lives in an apartment.
What do you need four cars for?
He will come tomorrow.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
I don't even have a girlfriend.
I'm going to let Tom respond.
I have a friend coming over to visit tomorrow.
Do you want something?
Did I hear you right?
Have you ever been to New York?
Stop talking about Tom.
Piercings can be a form of rebellion for teenagers.
I'm too tired to drive.
They live in the same state.
I must hide.
Are you blackmailing me?
I know what they mean.
Get in the car, please.
Why are you alone?
Our feud traces back to our childhood.
Tom was abducted.
Give me your phone.
Is that why you want to hurt me?
I thought I might never see you again.
Why are people scared of you?
How did you get here so fast?
Are you studying English?
How did you get to know about her?
There's no one but me here.
This car needs to be washed.
The request was granted.
You don't need to tell me.
I have no intention of staying.
Is there anything you want to say?
Please complete your homework.
Absence of rain caused the plants to die.
You don't seem very concerned.
I was bored to death.
She married an American GI after the war.
He's just buying time.
It's been my dream since I was a little boy.
He kept on gambling, trying in vain to recoup his losses.
Do you want to join me for lunch?
He is still grappling with religious beliefs.
You are responsible for the result.
Tom asked the teacher some questions.
I'm moving, so I need boxes for my belongings.
I can't afford to buy such an expensive car.
I don't think I'll have the time to do that today.
How does it work?
I'm cultured.
I'm awake.
I hope everything went well.
The two of them split up.
Be creative.
I have a three-year contract.
She left her children behind.
It's really awesome.
He who knows the most often says the least.
Tom doesn't always obey his parents.
You're not my mother.
I have some time.
I thought I'd lost you.
Can you determine what happened?
You can't believe everything you hear.
Tom stared blankly at the wall.
You really are something.
She baked her husband an apple pie.
I want some of those.
I don't feel safe here.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
You should concentrate on one thing and learn to do it well.
Be careful not to step on the dog's tail.
I'm too sleepy to eat.
I didn't say I wasn't going.
Tom needs to leave early today.
Be a good boy.
Does that seem strange to you?
Tom has something that I want.
Are you able to type?
Don't commit yourself.
She visited him once a year.
It's refreshing.
I forbid you to go there.
It's a very good newspaper, isn't it?
Is there some sort of problem?
Do you want a lawyer?
Tom is the right man for the job.
Tom and Mary have never been to that restaurant.
What you did to Tom was cruel.
I don't have Tom's phone number.
I knew that Tom was a bum.
He likes sleeping.
She married him last year.
Say which one you would like.
I would like to be a pilot in the future.
I'm not sure what I was thinking.
Have you had dinner already?
Tom stepped on the rake.
Tom used to eat a lot of meat.
It's my dream to win a Nobel Prize.
You can come in.
Are you going much farther?
Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
I'm not like that.
Actually, I'm kind of busy.
I was hammered.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
I expect you know all about it.
You can't believe everything you hear.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
Tell Tom I love him.
They put off their departure due to the heavy snow.
She's much heavier than him.
I have some errands to run.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
He isn't alone anymore.
Will you show me your ticket? "Yes, of course."
Please send me a picture of yourself.
The cold weather kept us indoors.
I hate it when I have to sit between two fat guys on a plane.
That didn't help very much.
I've never eaten Chinese food before.
Some Canadian territories have almost no people.
Tom knows a girl named Mary.
There are a lot of fish in this lake.
I stayed with an American family.
I'm so sorry.
Ten years have gone by.
There's no door.
How do you know those guys won't try to kill us?
I want to sit down for a change.
He was banished from the kingdom.
No child should go hungry.
Mary must be Tom's girlfriend.
You'll never be young again.
My mother made a sweater for me.
I bought a watch.
This is going to be a long day.
I know Tom does that, too.
My mother is preparing supper.
Don't show off.
All you have to do is to hand this book to him.
A rubber ball bounces because it is elastic.
He was covered with bruises.
It's an artificial flower.
We're still here.
He spoke about peace.
He was declared bankrupt.
Tom crossed the room.
Throw the dice.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
I'll take care of it right now.
All in all, the international conference was a success.
I'm not against people owning guns.
You have to go the rest of the way without me.
I don't think his story is true.
Old people have difficulty understanding modern technology.
Someone must have left the door open.
This problem is not avoidable.
I like their pictures.
He gives an apple to the teacher every day.
The movie starts at ten o'clock.
I thought you'd be older.
I ate breakfast at eight.
Look at the size of that thing!
Most of my friends are girls.
Get away from me.
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
I thought I'd find you here.
You made my day.
Fewer young people know how to write in longhand.
I will finish my homework by nine.
I lather my face before shaving.
He let me go.
Sorry, I'm a stranger here.
Here we are.
I can't put up with all that noise.
He married a very pretty girl.
The driver felt like taking a rest.
The press is interested in his private life.
Fasten the rope to the tree.
Can I take that as a compliment?
Don't tell me to relax.
We were under constant surveillance.
The schedule dictates that this work be done by the weekend.
Tom met Mary at work.
Don't be upset.
I never let anyone else feed my dog.
I am saving money in order to buy a new personal computer.
Was that your idea?
Are you going by bus or car?
If you'd prefer a room closer to the Convention Center, please let us know.
Tom told us everything.
He's very intelligent.
Radio is a great invention.
I think you should see this.
This desk takes up too much room.
I told him I wanted to go to Boston.
When will he be busy?
My wish is to be a singer.
Are you good at tennis?
I wish to speak with you in private.
I took care of my sick sister.
Of course, we believe you.
I wholeheartedly agree.
Tom looks very worried.
He stayed in his hotel most of the next day, talking to friends and supporters.
If only I'd hadn't stayed so long!
Tom looked.
How did I get here?
She accused him of having lied to her.
Do you study every day?
We've got nothing to hide.
I think we should do that.
We're new in town.
I know how to solve the problem, but I've been asked not to tell you.
We are supposed to know the rules.
I would like to call on you one of these days.
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy.
Why aren't you talking to me?
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
Each one of us was given three hundred dollars.
I owe you something.
Tom is back in town.
I don't have the ball.
When does it close?
Give me your money!
I forgot something important.
All you have to do is wash the dishes.
I have no one else to turn to but you.
This is not true love.
I have seen enough.
What's your favorite tongue twister?
I don't know what the answer is.
I corrected myself.
I will go if you go.
I think we both should leave.
I want to talk to you about this report.
That's not what worries me.
They can't do that.
Because of rain, we couldn't go to the beach.
The player faked an injury.
I think I'll take a look around.
I just assumed that everything was going to be OK.
Do you want something?
That accident is a very good example of what happens when you're not careful.
My father died before I got my diploma.
Tom has lost more than thirty kilograms.
I didn't argue.
Can you shut up?
Tell me what I did wrong.
I want to find my own place.
I have a new boyfriend, but my ex-boyfriend doesn't know about it yet.
They were so different.
I've been following you.
Defend yourself.
I will do all I can for you.
Somebody is in our garage.
I need a bag.
Money is everything.
I have information.
You're very smart.
She is as thin as a broom stick.
I saw the file.
He has been living in the cabin by himself for more than ten years.
What did you want to talk to me about?
As soon as the accident occurred, a police car rushed to the scene.
Stop hitting your brother.
I think I'm really in love for the first time.
I'd like to talk to you.
I don't have any problem getting to sleep.
Come to my office.
These flowers aren't only beautiful, but they smell nice.
I can't condone what you did.
I pulled as hard as I could.
Could you make room for me?
What time is it by your watch?
I've worn out two pairs of shoes this year.
You'll go far.
What does this stand for?
No one asked you.
Mary put some lipstick on.
I thought you'd left.
A crow is as black as coal.
The money is gone.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
I only wish that were possible.
I should be there.
Some people do not like to wake up early in the morning.
You must not lose sight of your goal in life.
Get in the back seat.
You need to exercise more.
Did you find a solution?
You're not that crazy.
What time does the concert start?
I said so.
You can never tell how long these meetings will last.
Don't push it.
I'd like to believe you.
I'm not sure.
I don't enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around.
I'll think about it over the weekend.
Were you watching TV last night at nine o'clock?
What you're doing makes me nervous.
Everyone kept talking.
Tom's face feels rough because he needs to shave.
I might be a few minutes late.
Blow your nose.
Tom came home very late.
I don't know what the matter is.
I think he's attracted to you.
This dog bites.
My mother is anxious about my future.
You're not that old, Tom.
All of my brothers died in the war.
Because of that virus, many elephants lost their lives.
I'm afraid I won't be able to make myself understood in French.
They'll have to wait.
I'm certain of that.
Girls say that all the time.
All you have to do is talk.
Tom is one of the few people I can trust.
I can't believe I listened to you.
She left the last page blank.
Why's the yellow light flashing?
Did you enjoy your meal?
I don't know what Tom wants to do.
Look, I know that.
I figured I could count on you.
You look happy.
I love to play golf.
I couldn't understand the announcement that was just made.
After their quarrel, she called it quits.
What's the score?
They're related to each other.
As soon as she got her salary, she spent it all.
Why are you so sad today?
She reminds me of someone.
You said the same thing about Tom.
He felt in his pocket for his wallet.
I love sitting on the beach.
Let's pray.
A person who chases two rabbits won't catch either.
It is easy to answer the question.
Not everybody can be an artist.
I like to play music with Tom.
We all need to work together.
Tom wants a new car.
I'm glad to see you again.
No one seemed to hear.
She got very angry with the children.
Can somebody give me a hand here?
Tom's phone can take pictures.
Tom, may I have some money?
I figured you might want this.
Don't pay attention to her.
What was it?
I'd rather go out than stay indoors.
Where's Tom?
I bet you've never climbed a tree.
He teaches us history.
Why is it so quiet here?
Her hair was long enough to reach the floor.
I can't tell you the answer to that yet.
We'll manage.
Tom and Mary fight all the time.
Aren't you going to Tom's party?
If you are hungry, why don't you eat?
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
I listened to the radio while I worked.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
Ask your parents for permission.
When she saw that they had no schools, she started one.
Ask me something easier.
May I be of further service?
The doctor examined the baby.
I asked my teacher what to do next.
Can you believe what he said?
She acted as if she knew nothing about it.
We expect a lot from him.
I shouldn't have wasted my time reading that.
Tom is my only real friend.
I see what you did there.
I wish I were younger.
She started dancing when she was eight.
How does that make you feel?
I made some mistakes on the test.
He pretended not to be listening.
A car in the parking lot is on fire.
I think this piano hasn't been tuned for a few years.
A trip to America this summer is out of the question.
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
He likes geography and history.
Who's talking?
Everybody was obeying the speed limit, so I knew there was likely a speed trap ahead.
That's not my car.
His house was sold for $10,000.
Give me a toothpick.
I'm failing at my job.
She may spill the beans.
Our ammunition has run out.
You're very sophisticated.
Would you please not leave the door open?
She walked up to him and asked him what his name was.
It's all in your head.
A honeymoon in Canada costs a lot of money.
You're a wonderful friend.
I appreciate you being here.
I know Tom isn't in bed yet.
I do have one request.
I feel nothing.
He liked that.
This doesn't serve any purpose.
This safe is for keeping valuables.
I thanked him from the bottom of my heart.
I'd like something to eat.
I didn't know Tom.
Let me think it over, and I'll let you know later.
I had a bad summer.
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
We insist that a meeting be held as soon as possible.
I just want the truth.
You're fashionable.
Why don't you use a hammer?
Tom's grandmother looks healthy.
Do you know her father?
A famous architect built this house.
You've misspelled my name.
He would be glad to hear that.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
He wondered why she did that.
That's something of an understatement.
I'm truly sorry.
Don't tell me that again.
Is this pen yours?
Where are my glasses?
You can't rely on his help.
Tom is being very cooperative.
After the game, he went straight home to feed his dog.
Don't be late for school again.
I think she is good at dancing.
We got there at the same time.
I used to go to church on Sunday.
Don't disappear on me again.
This doesn't look good.
Congratulations!
Don't stand up.
He had a new suit made.
I sometimes hear rumors about her.
That's not the right answer.
That's not your problem anymore.
He is a tennis player.
I'm by your side.
I cut my finger while trying to open the package.
He made a lot of money.
I have a good appetite today.
There were no fingerprints on the knife.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
I felt a little dizzy.
I can help you look for it.
I love this show.
If you were in my place, what would you do?
If you had a million dollars, what would you do?
I was ushered to my seat.
I've heard rumors.
You should put on some clothes.
Tom is always lying.
Today was a terrible day.
That was the first time that a man walked on the moon.
I'm going to chop this tree down.
He's kind of cute, isn't he?
Have you told your mom?
I admire your bravery.
I know all about it.
She's waiting for you at home.
Is anyone else home?
You were terrified, weren't you?
We want you to be more careful next time.
Be punctual.
I don't see any blood.
She sent him a postcard.
I listened but couldn't make out what they were saying.
We are all convinced of his innocence.
I had a very good day yesterday.
What did you want to see me about?
I stopped at the supermarket on my way home.
I'm being treated like a child.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
We crossed the river by boat.
We tried to cheer him up.
That's what you should do.
What exactly do you want me to do?
A caged cricket eats just as much as a free cricket.
I didn't expect to find you here.
They must really hate me.
I have nothing to say.
There's no one in the room.
I read a lot of books last summer.
You're going to love our food.
Don't you want to know why I did that?
Tell Tom to shut up.
There are too many things to do!
I know Tom is in.
He dwells in the country.
Save me a seat.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
You'd better change your eating habits.
Go get your shoes polished.
This is inappropriate.
My father is retiring next spring.
I need to talk with you.
I won't do that again.
I gave you fair warning.
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
Can you ship it to New York City?
Did you hear the news on the radio this morning?
This is ugly.
Could you solve the problem?
He made up his mind to go there alone.
Manuela's clothes are very stylish.
Our plans fell through at the last minute.
You should find a more constructive way of venting your anger.
We can't prove anything.
I think that's horrible.
I know this must be hard for you.
That's what you said last time.
The organ started to play.
I am living the good life.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
We're going east.
I have a slight fever.
Your friends are downstairs.
You're preaching to the choir.
He doesn't like traveling by air.
That sounds like something you would do.
Tom's death was an accident. "Are you sure?"
Is there anything that I can do for you?
Dogs are smart.
It's time for me to go, kids.
They found Tom in the crowd.
Staying at home is boring.
There's no table in the room.
We're having a blast.
What does it involve?
We could've done better.
He shares a room.
Everything is going fine.
Steam is coming out of the engine.
Who is playing the guitar?
I know that you said that.
Have another drink.
I'm writing a novel.
Where is it hidden?
That sounds very enticing.
What do you feel most proud of?
Tom said he would buy it.
I didn't ask you that.
Can his story be true?
He's English, but lives in India.
Tom was Mary's first boss.
I don't know where exactly.
Stay out of my way!
Tom studies hard.
I got off lightly.
It's more complicated than I originally thought.
I'm a little busy.
If I tell her the truth, she will never forgive me.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come.
Where did they go?
A mother must protect her child's teeth from decay.
All the skill of the sailors gave way to the violence of the storm.
Where is the bus schedule?
The apple trees blossomed early this year.
Our country's climate is temperate.
Tom burned all of the letters that Mary had sent him.
What is this place?
I just want to be sure.
I'm not going to help you.
I'm going to go take a nap.
He encouraged me to try again.
Maybe that's what I need.
You don't have to be so rude.
The man at the door didn't tell me his name.
I hear you were grounded.
He's very open.
How long are you going to stay here?
You can use my dictionary.
This word has three syllables.
I want to go back to where we were.
I don't get opera.
I'm not selling you my car.
Did you go to Tom's party last Saturday?
I'm busy all the time.
I was bluffing.
I want to exchange this for a smaller size.
You were pretending, weren't you?
He extinguished the fire.
Tell me the story.
You're very understanding.
The meeting was almost over.
I'm happy with it.
I consider him a great writer.
Children whose parents are rich do not know how to use money.
What're you all dressed up for?
I haven't sold one of those in weeks.
We can do a lot better.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
Police think the fire was deliberately lit.
I think we'd better start over again.
Please let go of my arm.
Where can I buy snacks?
A computer can calculate very rapidly.
He must have studied English hard.
Did I do something stupid?
I want a chair.
I don't know what's happening.
It's a cloak-and-dagger operation.
Did anybody see you?
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
I'm waiting for a train.
Tom started running.
You're contagious.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Let's take it down a notch.
I think we shouldn't have gotten married.
That's exactly what we want.
She's open-minded.
How did the exam go?
Tom isn't Mary's boyfriend.
It's a beautiful picture.
It had snowed.
Tom had never told anyone but Mary.
I need the following items.
Our only daughter died of cancer.
That's one of them.
My mother died when I was a child.
It's an emergency.
Don't worry. Tom won't let us down.
I don't know if I can stay.
It's mine.
He's faking.
The room was quiet.
I don't need a wheelchair.
Tom walks slowly.
Can you promise me you won't do that?
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
He has just graduated from college.
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
We haven't found the gun yet.
I know it doesn't look like it, but I've actually gotten rid of a lot of stuff out of the spare room.
Don't give up.
You're very tall.
A good idea suddenly struck her.
What on earth does this have to do with me?
You shouldn't read such useless books.
Please move your bicycle out of here.
It's dangerous to expose babies to strong sunlight.
The vase that Tom gave me is made of glass.
He came home late last night.
You are a troublemaker.
Are you courageous?
I'm amazed at his rapid progress in English.
I could have prevented this.
I never said I was an artist.
I really should be going.
We will make it public.
I agree with you.
This time, you've gone too far.
I'll never be able to do that without your help.
He slept with the window open.
We think we've found a way to help you.
Close the window before going to bed.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
Tom is not yet able to swim.
Don't leave me behind!
Think it over and let me know what you decide.
The teacher began to ask us questions.
Prices are reasonable.
You've got some nerve.
All of a sudden, it began raining.
You need to come home.
Quit acting like a child.
Our whole case hinges on whether the government's actions were constitutional or not.
Are you busy?
I caught up with them soon.
I come here every Monday.
I feel sick.
Could you turn the heat down, please?
The war began three years later.
He is afraid of his father.
Allow us to do our job.
It is too hot to work.
I thought you didn't know that.
I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.
Where are we going next?
All of us will die sooner or later.
Look at that tall building.
It is high time you went to bed.
I didn't tell you everything.
Don't judge people by appearance.
I think it's time for me to join the fight.
Do you have a room that's a little cheaper?
I'm not dead yet.
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
Could I see you in private?
Find the cat.
Let's get it over with.
She has no more than 100 dollars.
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow.
Get out of here before I call the cops.
We all make mistakes.
I will give you this book.
Come on, drinks are on me.
The architect achieved worldwide fame.
A number of books were stolen.
You're going to miss your flight.
Put it on my account.
That would be really great.
The man robbed him of all his money.
We are boiling water.
It so happened that I had no money with me.
I would never have guessed that.
It will be some time before he gets well.
I lent Tom some money.
He went to stay with his cousin.
How long do I have to stay here?
What do you do in the afternoon?
Don't you have a sense of justice?
I rewrote it.
He played an important role on the committee.
I thought you needed money.
Did I give you enough time?
What a lovely day it is!
Why didn't you shave?
She must have forgotten the promise.
Tom certainly had an interesting story to tell.
Which one of your guitars do you enjoy playing the most?
I was nearly hit by a car.
Clearly you're not interested.
Do you want a banana?
The population of Germany is less than half that of the United States.
It's too late to apologize now.
A considerable amount of money was appropriated for the national defense.
I ordered the book from England.
You're crazy to buy such an expensive bike.
We were winning.
I didn't want to waste so much time.
There are too many ads on YouTube.
That's reason enough.
My TV has quit working.
You didn't warn me.
Choose any of these pens.
You've been suspended.
If you taste this sauce you'll find it a bit salty.
Without a dictionary, it would be hard to study English.
Is there a parking lot?
A very unfortunate case came to our attention several years ago.
Tom has to do that.
How many letters does the Russian alphabet have?
Can you think of a better way?
I'm retired, too.
Please sing a song.
I told you it didn't work.
I really appreciate you helping me out.
Our team is two points ahead.
I'd like to go with you.
This car is very economical on gas.
Many people who hear Tom speaking French think he's a native speaker.
It is no use trying again.
They talked about it on the telephone.
How are you doing these days?
Is he dead?
How are you feeling this morning?
I can't explain it to you now.
Leave your message after the beep.
These are my brother and sister, Tom and Mary.
I don't talk to him anymore.
You can pour the wine into the glass.
The stripes were horizontal.
Do you want anything to eat?
They robbed me blind.
I woke up.
I let the cat in.
I'm getting used to it.
I couldn't remember his name.
May I begin by thanking every one for your warm welcome?
Is it all paid for?
A new serial will begin in next month's issue.
There is no third choice.
The truth shall set you free.
Tom already knows how to read.
You need to be more attentive in class.
He resigned as president.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
It was horrible.
Try to find it.
Tom is average height.
I think it's a bad idea.
Tom's grandfather and Mary's grandfather fought together in World War II.
All of the dogs were alive.
I know Tom is discouraged.
Look at all these flowers.
Tom was wearing a baseball cap.
Learning English is hard work.
Open up.
My shoulder hurts.
You can't break the appointment.
I am much obliged to you for your help.
I'm glad you're here.
Listen to your mother.
Did anyone hear the gun shot?
I am reading a book.
Put this sentence into English.
I'd like to see your warrant.
They were murdered.
Tom's violent.
Tom took the wrong train.
I gave up hope.
She hugged him.
What do you like to do in your free time?
What's your email address?
I thought about what a jerk I had been.
Sometimes trying your best just isn't good enough.
I'm making a lot more money now.
She is a reliable person.
I want to convey my sympathy.
Isn't it sickening?
What does this image make you think of?
Do you think Tom will like the concert?
She is dark-skinned.
I warned you once.
My mother is not always at home.
I don't want to be your enemy.
Beef, please.
We're all in this together.
I surrender.
He tends to talk too much.
Tom was motivated.
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
My favorite color is blue.
He is ahead of us in mathematics.
The leaves on the tree have turned red.
I washed the windows.
Don't deceive him.
I think everything is under control now.
I'd like to ask you the same question once more.
I did better than everyone expected.
Can I have the key now, please?
It looks like the dog wants something to eat.
This is your house now.
I know Tom was truthful.
Tom isn't like me.
Our boat approached the small island.
Everyone had to start working.
You have good reason to be angry.
Forty people attended.
This fact proves his innocence.
We'll talk about it later.
When did the war end?
I've forgotten my email address.
What made you ask that question?
Will you please go there?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
Almost everyone was dead.
I think you should get started.
Did you hear the roar of the lions?
It's cloudy.
What are your plans for this weekend?
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I've decided to end our friendship.
I'll go wherever you want me to go.
Kobe is the city where I was born.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
This is exactly what I expected from you.
This is for your protection.
China is a huge country.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
Onions cook more quickly than potatoes.
It looked fresh.
He goes to school by bicycle.
I wasn't aware of that.
We don't have anything to eat.
Tom doesn't talk much.
A man who speaks the truth needs a fast horse.
Tom ran out of matches so he couldn't light the fire.
I left my jacket in the classroom.
Business is looking up.
I want to pretend it never happened.
I think everything is functional.
Get me the details.
It really did happen.
I'm not a cop.
Foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious.
We were both afraid to talk.
I didn't know Tom was going to do it.
Maybe I'm going through a midlife crisis.
I'll try that.
You're not as smart as me.
I want to earn more money.
All of them went there.
Wear warm clothes.
Come on in!
Are you mentally ill?
He is a teacher at our school.
Love began to grow between the two.
I didn't pretend to be your friend.
Fasten your seat belt.
She found pleasure in reading.
What are friends for?
The horse stopped and refused to move.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
It wasn't my fault.
Why are you here?
He struck a match.
This is life!
He held his breath.
Walking down the street, I ran into an old friend.
Let's see what happens this time.
I invited all my friends.
I am not a teacher.
Were you at work?
I'm coming to help you.
I had to get away from here.
My dog sleeps under my bed.
He will soon come back.
I'm at your service.
Can Tom see us?
I wish that noise would stop. It gets on my nerves.
I'll split it with you fifty-fifty.
I don't regret what happened last night.
Let's get out of here as fast as we can.
He differs from me in some ways.
I can help you.
I think this is the most impressive building on Park Street.
How is the family doing?

I will wait until she comes.
This could be a mistake.
That wasn't good.
Shut the door.
You were right, too.
I like your outfit.
She was asked to convince him to get his son to paint the house.
She may have missed the train.

This is very true.
She is never late for school.
I talked to my friend in the FBI.
I thought you'd understand.
The house is said to be haunted.
I feel like seeing you.
Yesterday, I was at Tom's house.
You couldn't solve the problem, could you?
I need a job.
She expected him to solve the problem.
The news made her happy.
Why would I want to help Tom?
I'm normal.
Have you looked at these brochures?
He made up his mind.
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
We're lost.
I wasn't always happy.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
He stood up.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
He touched my shoulder.
What foods should a diabetic not eat?

How long are they?
That's a very beautiful painting.
How did you come by this painting?
Tom scares everybody.
He felt sad because he lost his father.
I cut my right hand on a piece of glass.
She complained that the picture was too revealing.
I want you to meet someone.
I suppose you've got a point.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
We're untalented.
How much is he asking for? "A thousand euros."
Have you seen my car keys?
We were there for a long time.
Why don't you take off your coat?

I want to cook for you.
He is very friendly, so I enjoy working with him.
I thought Tom did a nice job.
I stayed home to rest.
I'm not going to school today.
The job is almost finished.
I think the story is true.
This is a matter of the utmost gravity.
I don't think you have a choice.
He was determined to go abroad.
You don't have to come.
We will survive.

Tom got engaged to Mary.
He is acquainted with my wife.
You don't have to respond.
You work hard.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Red is better.
She altered her plans.
You wanted me to get a job, so I did.
That was my second guess.
I see you've made a friend.
The only way to handle him is to let him think he is having his own way.
Why did you listen to them?
I will study German.
I won't let Tom go alone.
The rule only applies to foreigners.
Let me remind you of something.
It was your own choice.
I am very much obliged to you for your help.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
My girlfriend was crying.
I wish Tom could've been with us today.
I have misjudged you.
They won't let Tom in.
Why don't we order pizza?
She didn't try to evade the truth.
He survived his wife.
Coffee prices have jumped almost 50% in six months.
Is anyone on board?
There's something I need to talk with you about.
I hope you behaved well at school today.
What happened to my car?
We've never had this problem before.
I forgot where the car was.
I want you to tell me how to do this.
Nobody tells me anything.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
We're obedient.
You don't look so busy.
I just thought you were happy.
Tom sucked his thumb until he was three.
I know that you're smart.

Tom went back into his office.
That's how it was.
What made you so angry?

Are you happy with your new bass guitar?
I couldn't help laughing when I heard that story.
Tom is already back.
Tell me when dinner's ready.
All we can do is to wait for him.
How's your old lady doing?
He owes me a favor.
I've never even told my husband.
I knew something wasn't right.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
I'm all alone.
I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
I thought I was the only one who knew that.
Tom came on Monday and went back the day after.
Let's get cracking!
Would you like another beer?
I figured you might change your mind.
I've made this trip a thousand times.

We don't have to go.
I was wondering if you would like to go to the dance with me.
He's scared of dogs.
He fell in love with the girl at first sight.
He would not follow my advice.
Tom finished washing the dishes.
Could you explain it more simply?
You can call us at any time.
That's true too, isn't it?
He took back everything he said.
He searched all day for the letter.
Tom knew all that.
They're really ugly.
Your house is fantastic.
Please don't be angry at me.
Read the article.
Real men drink tea.
I can't imagine your not knowing her address.
Sit up straight.
It was her wish to go to Paris.
The scars are barely visible.
This is all for you.
I intended to study medicine in America.
You need to see a doctor.
Do you really think Tom is better than I am?
She was laughed at by her friends.

They're not prepared for this.

Make an appointment.
Go back to your room.
How did she come to know so much about fish?
He was naturally very angry.
Tom is our bass player.
He has never cleaned his room.
Tom would agree to do that.
I want you to die.
We're not involved.
You'll find the letter under these papers.
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.

I don't think that's enough.
We're all very good players.
They slept in the same bed.
Don't tell me that again.
Tom waited a while.
He made his way through the crowd.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Remain seated, please.
I knew I could do it.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Have you sold it yet?
I've tried to be your friend.

When did you finish writing the letter?
Let's see if I've got that right.
Instead of going myself, I sent a messenger.

He wanted to meet you.
I lost my watch yesterday.

Nobody called Tom.
They clung together for warmth.
We need to discuss this.
You're touching me.
I think you panicked.
The children were asleep upstairs.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
I feel a little insecure.
Come any closer, and I'll shoot you.

He did not have enough money.
I can't believe I listened to you.

Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
I was arrested on the spot.
That's more than I expected.

I don't think Tom needs our help.
I got there ahead of time.
He is more clever than wise.
She came out of there.
I'm observant.
I didn't see you.
Our school is further away than the station.

Who are we working for?
All I have to do is wait.

I'm sure they'll win.
Why don't you run for student council?
I don't need it anymore.
I am moving next month.

How are you doing?
You can make it.

He was raised in the United States, but his native language is Japanese.
You don't hear me complaining, do you?
I rescheduled.
Here is a letter for you.
I thought I had everything.
I promise.
The door opened slowly.
He was successful in the attempt.
I'm glad to have this opportunity to work with you.
You aren't invited.
When I lived in Rome, I took the subway every day.
The snow has melted.
I don't know the reason he is absent today.
Do you think it will be nice out tomorrow?

I hear from him every now and then.
Tom paid for it all.
I didn't receive even one letter from her.

That's exactly what I did.
We can't help you.
I just don't understand you.
I'm going to the convenience store. Is there anything you want?
His criticisms were out of place.
I've already told Tom that.
Is that for me?
He will have no chance of winning her heart.
I'm gathering information.
Which cup is yours?
What'll you be doing this summer?
I entered someone else's room by mistake.
Go away.

Is this price acceptable?
That's very considerate of you.

Don't make me answer that question.
It's best not to ask.

It's acceptable.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
Do you know where the train station is?
I'm not the only one who saw Tom swimming yesterday evening.

British English differs from American English in many ways.
I had to finish what I'd started.
I can't wait to meet you.
It's extremely unfair.
I think you know that's not true.
Make a decision.
I'm surprised Tom remembers us.
I know Tom is a liar.
Everyone needs to do this.
I guess that's good for you.
I need money to buy other things.
She started for Kyoto yesterday.
Will you help me clean the room?
I was like you once.
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
It is possible.
The plane will land before long.
You should get rid of these weeds.
I'm smarter than you.
Tom was really glad to hear that Mary was going to help him move.
Do you want to do this or not?
The shopkeeper went out of her way to help us.
That was just plain stupid.
Are you for or against my plan?
Tom knows who we are.
I've been away too long already.
I don't agree with him.
I just want to get my work done.
He died of lung cancer.
This sweater is warm.
Tom is the newest member of our team.
Stop screaming.
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
Call an ambulance.
Don't expect overtime.
That's lovely.
Give me a drink, please.
He's here to protect you.
Even my parents don't like me.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
You're the most intelligent person I know.
I'm forgetful.
Tom is learning French.
I couldn't lie to you.
There's no evidence.
He is a man of his word, so if he said he'd help, he will.
How long does it take to go there by bus?
There is no choice.
Let me find out.
This is an unusual situation.
I am willing to help you.
We own a dog and a cat.
Tom will be happy to see you again.
Happy is the man who is content with his lot.
I used to hate doing this.
Do you know how Tom got the scar on his chin?
Whose are they?
My brother lives in Tokyo.
I am sure we have a lot in common.
This is the best method.
Tom gave me everything I needed.
I wouldn't want to be a judge.
Are you through with your homework?
Tom intends to get up early tomorrow.
I saw you there.
How big you are!
Don't ever lie to me again.
I'll pay for lunch.
We're not all as tired as you are.
We're still friends.
Tom was a model inmate.
I'm not happy with this.
He asked her where she lived.
He's very likely to be late.
I'm reasonable.
Why would I want to go there alone?
You'll be asked why you want to be a teacher.
The receptionist forced me to sign my name on the paper.
We're a team.
Don't ask questions. Just follow orders.
She was crying.
You could've been hurt.
Certainly he is handsome and intelligent, but there is something about him that I can't like.
I finally gave up.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me that I'm in love.
He admitted that he was guilty.
Do you remember how we met?
You probably won't like it.
I don't know why you're all so upset.
I came upon a rare stamp at that store.
Tom crossed the street.
He likes to travel. I do, too.
Why do I have to do this by myself?
I think what Tom is doing is great.
He stood behind me.
I thought you'd be grateful.
Do you have a school uniform?
Are you vegetarian?
He prepared for his imminent departure.
Do you want me to tell Tom?
Tom would never do that to Mary.
Does Mary want me to walk her home?
He's a very hard worker.
Peel two of the bananas.
Who told Tom to leave?
The meeting hasn't started yet.
I can't put up with her any longer.
Where will you go?
You don't have to apologize.
You could do it if you really wanted to.
I know you've got a gun.
We agreed to start early the next morning.
I feel the same way as you do.
You can't smoke in here.
You're not a doctor.
You should stick those pictures in your album.
They charge too much for parking.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
We all suffered.
He was hurt in the accident.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
I think it's time for me to discuss the matter with him.
I can see you're frightened.
You're German, aren't you?
Cleaning the garage wasn't much fun.
That's the worst thing you can do!
Tom poured some cereal into a bowl.
I tried to imagine life on the moon.
This picture must have been taken in 1964.
I knew I'd get blamed eventually.
Don't play in the street.
I didn't cause the explosion.
Do you have a hobby?
I read the novel in three days.
The notebook is not yours. It's his.
Whose house is this?
I'm in no hurry.
Tom disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer.
Tom gets upset easily.
She has a good figure.
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
Do you want another one of these?
I'm not talking to you, Tom.
Are you still not convinced?
I will deal with him myself.
I'm happy to be here.
I'd like to rent a car.
Is this building open to the public?
Get to bed.
Didn't you go out?
She will not stick to her word.
I don't know when I'll be back.
My mother was usually very busy.
That's so tragic.
Wearing glasses makes you look more intellectual.
May I use your phone?
It's a shame that you're not coming.
Who painted this beautiful picture?
We play on Sunday.
You can't handle this alone.
I must resist.
I'll tell my wife.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
I saved you.
You're not entirely wrong.
What on earth were you thinking, bringing him here?
Could I have the bill, please?
I'm not going to send Tom a Christmas card.
It's not mine.
I know Tom is chubby.
There is no telling what will happen tomorrow.
It's not a dog.
Can you light the way?
It is what everybody says.
You have only to watch what I do.
Can you give me another example?
What high school did you go to?
We're going to miss doing this.
Keep working.
You must go with me.
Aren't you surprised to see me?
Tom is a handsome man.
I'm getting used to the weather here.
He said he was poor.
It makes me really happy that you're here.
She advised him to do more exercise.
How much money is left?
You can't believe that.
Why are you flinching?
He lived to be seventy years old.
I'm rather proud of it.
That was a bad decision.
We missed the deadline.
Tom cried.
It depends on many things.
He dreaded having to spend Christmas in the hospital.
Why do I believe you?
We knew that.
Tom didn't tell me why.
He came late, as is often the case with him.
Do you consider them dangerous?
What exactly are you implying?
His policies were too progressive.
I think you ought to listen.
I wear a suit, but not a tie.
The dictionary is on the desk.
He started swearing.
We want the facts.
Be content.
She has her faults, but I like her.
Give me a couple minutes to get dressed.
The ice sheets are melting.
I cleared my throat, but no words came.
Nobody talks to Tom anymore.
I like writing with a fountain pen.
Tom isn't as busy this week as he was last week.
Don't talk to me!
We are sorry for his mistake.
The floor is slippery.
I almost died.
I needed money.
I didn't want to intrude.
Many cities were destroyed by bombs.
I'm now officially part of this group.
I got rid of it.
The water turned to ice.
You can't win every time.
Tom has already gone to school.
The governor was surprised by the commission's response.
I made it myself.
Is there a picture of Tom in that album?
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
You'll get over this.
I'm just a little busy right now.
I have no experience.
Tom leaned down to kiss Mary.
That's quite logical.
You're invited.
It's not what I wanted to say.
You're all crazy.
We have no choice.
There's nothing surprising about that.
Please lower the window.
We had many bitter experiences during the war.
I admire you for your courage.
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?
I'll fix it up all right.
You look perfect.
I need a ride.
I had intended to go abroad.
You can stay if you like.
I don't have time for a walk.
I haven't tried.
I'm hoping it's only a temporary problem.
It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
Can you put some sunscreen on my back?
She told him a joke, but he didn't think it was funny.
The house is owned by him.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Isn't that just a prairie fire?
How long did you stay?
You're not allowed in this room.
Tom is reading a book.
He is the chosen one.
Would I only work on weekends if I could? Of course, I would.
I didn't do anything.
He was a forceful leader.
It takes fifteen minutes to walk from here to the campus.
A bystander videotaped the police beating using their cell phone.
Everything was going great.
He looks young.
He had a book in his hand.
She was advised by him on that matter.
I want to go over it again in more detail.
We're still not sure.
Roll down your window.
He doesn't read many newspapers.
That's what I did.
He saw everything.
I don't like long drives.
Did you enjoy the movie you saw last night?
What kind of dessert would you like?
He has brought shame upon his family.
Did we make a huge mistake?
She herself helped him because no one else would.
He worked long into the night.
Tom unfolded his napkin.
Well, have you decided?
She is devoted to her three children.
I'm glad that you can come.
You're not my mother.
Leave your hat and overcoat in the hall.
She always keeps her hair clean.
My car is a Toyota.
The money is gone.
England is proud of her poets.
I just didn't want you in here.
Can you get away from your parents?
It's up to you to keep things running smoothly.
We all want answers.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.
I'm sorry to upset your plans.
They agreed to give us an interview.
Perhaps you can beat me.
She really likes writing poems.
I don't really know how else I can explain that.
This chair is yours.
It feels silly.
None of us had any idea what was going to happen.
I am so busy that I can't help you.
Tom hopes to inherit a lot of money when his mother passes away.
Tom fed the horse.
I couldn't stop crying.
Can you give us a lift?
What's going on?
What can you teach me?
Could I say something, please?
Put your hands in the air.
I wasn't informed of this.
Where did you get that scar?
I got up very early this morning.
There is little chance of his winning.
My father doesn't like football.
Here, look at this.
This decision won't make anybody happy.
What did you do during the holidays?
Don't you care?
He is a harsh critic.
Frankly speaking, he's wrong.
I'm trying not to be seen.
I gave him my phone number.
I'm not going to name names.
You're so picky.
Is this your opinion?
I read the article.
He sings so well that it's impossible to hold back tears.
They say love is blind.
He committed one crime after another.
What changes the world is communication, not information.
Let's get back to work.
Stop changing the subject.
Her face beamed with joy.
Why are they protesting?
Do you know any good places to eat around here?
He is suffering from a headache.
Show me what you have hidden behind your back.
That is not how we do things here.
He studied military history.
I knew it wouldn't work.
How many times a week do you eat rice?
The tip of the key broke.
That's a brilliant idea.
No one gave up hope.
I may win if I'm lucky.
Tom certainly fits the description that the police gave us.
Tom is not dumb.
Hikers need to carry a compass with them to find their way through the woods.
I'm sure you have other skills.
At our company, the retirement age is 60.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
I just did it.
I think you're being a little too careful.
I bought the same camera as you have.
Maybe it was just a coincidence.
This is the most comfortable chair I've sat on in a long time.
Tom and Mary have two cats.
It won't be long before he is up and about.
I bathe every day.
I think he's too young.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
Tom is in a meeting right now.
He was made to do so.
How would you like us to proceed?
I waited for you to get out of prison.
Did you get some rest?
I'm observant.
They said you were fired.
A bad cold prevented her from attending the class.
He likes to travel abroad.
Are you all right?
You have to hold back.
That's very possible.
I was deeply impressed by his speech.
He has a good accent.
If you don't know the meaning of a word, look it up in a dictionary.
I have to finish what I started.
I'm not done with you.
He kept quite calm.
Circumstances forced us to put off the meeting.
You should be careful in choosing friends.
Here's my account number.
I have to admit I'm interested.
He had to go there.
One of the bulls pushed the fence down.
I prefer working to doing nothing.
The priest pronounced them man and wife.
My house is up the road.
I'm smarter than you.
We found the boy sound asleep.
We're ruthless.
She has a flower in her hand.
I have a terrible pain.
Did you lend any money to my brother?
I want to know what I can do.
It feels like a dream.
My brother has become a priest.
He who laughs last, laughs best.
Why would somebody want to live there?
I was quite shocked by this.
Thank you for listening to me.
Do you do this often?
Were you all serious?
A few minutes' walk brought us to the park.
He had his head in the clouds in class.
When I was your age, I had a boyfriend.
The tsunami alert was cancelled.
Put it there, not here.
Everything in this room is going to be thrown away.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
It's bad for you.
They did not clap for us.
I don't even know what that means.
I got upset.
I don't have a system.
I'm not crazy. You're the one who's crazy.
It's October already.
I lowered my meat consumption.
I know I'm alone on this.
I have an appointment with my uncle tomorrow.
He always keeps his promises.
Drop the gun.
My internet connection was cut off.
I doubt that's what really happened.
When does that start?
She probably knows.
If only I'd been a couple of years older, they would've let me into the bar.
Grab the end of this rope.
There are still a lot of things that have to be done.
You could at least try to be a bit more polite, even though it's not like you.
Her anger is understandable.
Find me a glass.
I want to know why you're late.
It's eight o'clock in the morning.
I'm not your friend.
Which cup is yours?
I know who you are.
I want you to come work for me.
He was accompanied by his wife.
I can't let you go in there alone.
The vegetation was thick and lush.
They won't wait long.
Nothing is new under the sun.
Haven't you eaten lunch?
He set fire to his own house.
He plays poker with them.
When was the last time you saw her?
How are you holding up?
We may as well keep it a secret.
It's been years since I played tennis.
I can't find the right man for me.
I have to clean my room.
He has a cat and two dogs.
Both of them started laughing.
That's really funny.
He is quite satisfied with his income.
I think we should talk.
Tom knew that he'd done something wrong.
The government collapsed after a vote in parliament.
The company wants to employ 20 people.
I usually eat two or three eggs for breakfast at least three times a week.
I just got a little carried away.
Tom doesn't live here.
I figured I might find you here.
I think about it every day.
I shouldn't have interfered.
Do you have many friends?
If I were you, I would paint it blue.
This is a very good question.
He is making preparations for a trip.
We have no proof.
How long are you going to keep giving me the silent treatment?
How's your kid doing?
Who asked you to do that?
I could get you fired, you know.
Everyone in my family is happy.
The withdrawal symptoms are more severe than I thought.
Tom runs 10 kilometers a day.
How do you go there? By car?
I bought a house.
We've been spotted.
She's smart and beautiful.
She's my sister.
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise.
She asked him if he knew my telephone number.
What's Tom doing here?
She took him to the zoo.
Learning French takes longer than most people think.
That's not going to be a problem.
Tom's tie is yellow.
Are you tired of living?
Tom is here somewhere.
You're lost.
My brother wants to go to the moon some day.
Tom may have told the truth.
Is this your briefcase?
I want you to know what really happened.
I won't repeat anything you say to me.
We walked ten miles that day.
Let me know.
You don't need a lot.
Have you found a cure?
What are you going to do this evening?
Can somebody open the door please?
There are a lot of dustballs under the couch.
I'll tell you a story.
He's a bit tipsy.
I had left the key in the office the day before.
What exactly are you proposing?
The mere sight of a dog frightens him.
I'm sure I can persuade Tom.
I don't trust you.
I don't want to go to Italy.
I'm glad.
I'm not ready.
I know I can count on you all.
Open the windows to let in some air.
I gave you what you wanted.
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
That sounds right.
Tom didn't complain about anything.
Why do you have your umbrella up? It's not raining.
Get dressed quickly.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
Well, I have to go now.
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
There are more girls than boys in this school.
You're an interesting girl.
I moved back with my parents.
He can't handle the truth.
They're right behind me.
I'd like to replace it.
Please play something by Chopin for me.
How was I supposed to know?
Let me think this over.
It looks amazing.
This dress suits you well.
Better late than never.
I'm working on my website.
I just assumed you'd be here.
Tom is going to be back later today.
This is the strangest thing I've ever done.
Did you say something, dear?
Was anybody hurt?
What can you see from your window?
I don't have any money.
She doesn't have many friends in this town.
She felt her heart beat quickly.
I really like this story.
Historically, the Persian Gulf belongs to Iran.
What language do you speak at home?
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
I had never seen a windmill until I visited the Netherlands.
I sprained my finger while playing volleyball.
I didn't buy them.
Here's the address.
Tom lied to you, didn't he?
What are the terms of the contract?
She has the habit of clearing her throat whenever she's nervous.
That old bridge is anything but safe.
Have you ever had a long distance relationship?
No one said anything.
I helped her wash dishes.
You're so predictable.
How many books do you think you have read so far?
They have gone to Europe.
You attach too much importance to what he says.
There are many useful appliances in the hardware store.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Get back here.
I will not be defeated.
Tell Tom.
I told you not to play your cello late at night, but you did and now the neighbors have complained.
I totally agree with you.
Women generally outlive their husbands.
I get nervous when I speak in front of large crowds.
How many did you get?
I didn't know where Tom wanted me to plant the marigolds.
I didn't really care about that.
He is immediately above me in rank.
I went snorkeling in a beautiful coral reef.
Who's the girl in a yellow raincoat?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
It's been raining since Monday.
The pain was unbearable.
What're you writing?
It is a pity you cannot come.
I know your son.
I asked him to do that.
You know I have to go.
I think it's you who should apologize to her.
Please fill out the Customs Declaration Form.
I was having a bad day.
Tom thought Mary was probably about thirty.
You should put on some clothes.
If there's anything at all that you don't understand, you can ask me anytime.
In the winter, I like to sled down the small hill close to our home.
Every seat was full.
I don't love her.
What would you like to drink?
I ran out of breath.
She laughed to cover her fear.
I can swim fast.
We've already covered this subject.
I'm just waiting for a friend.
Tom is a member of this club.
I met him quite unexpectedly.
The story is true. Only the names have been changed.
Please let me off in front of that building.
I thought you were a friend.
I envy Tom.
I don't want to visit Tom.
That's against the law.
Is Tom ill?
I'll be with you in a moment.
You must be homesick.
I know what you want to talk about.
There aren't many trees near my house.
I can't stop smoking.
He was paralyzed by fear.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
More than one million tons of coal are mined each day in Australia.
I'll shoot both of you.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
The roof is really in need of repair.
Your French is excellent.
You are my hero.
Get away from me.
I've got no problem with that.
Tom knows a lot of songs.
We chartered a bus.
Are you proud of your father?
You talk really fast.
Cricket is a game that takes skill.
We should not put restrictions on foreign trade.
Tom drinks.
Tom doesn't have the courage to do that.
Tom has a big mouth.
I thought you were injured.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
Tom told me that Mary was dead.
I'm not giving you any money.
We're going to give it another try.
When my wife finds out, she won't be happy.
I have no clue.
I had to decide right then and there.
It's vibrating.
My college has a dormitory.
Will you be going?
They attained their goal.
Tom filled out the application form.
The church bell is ringing.
She cared for her sick father.
You should buy an answering machine.
She is not what she used to be.
It was a lie, of course.
I expect Tom won't want to do that.
The national debt has trebled in the last ten years.
I just want your love.
Tom has actually never been to Boston.
Prepare yourself.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
Tell me what happened.
Tell Tom we're waiting for him.
Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814.
He seemed disappointed at the results.
Don't try to do too much.
I found out something interesting today.
Is there anybody who can drive a car?
I'll come back soon.
As you make your bed, so you must lie in it.
Why don't you take your jacket off?
We are Australian.
I am glad to see her.
I had an accident.
Maybe Tom will give me a job.
I could sure use that scholarship money.
I ate bread and butter this morning.
You don't look very good.
He can speak eight languages.
He said that it was nine o'clock.
Why did you buy it?
I just wanted to clarify that.
I'm not happy.
He will be here in half an hour.
Which one of your guitars do you enjoy playing the most?
The plane still hasn't taken off.
Sorry, something went wrong.
I want to live in a big city.
That isn't something I want to do.
I didn't know that.
She is sitting on the bench.
Does Tom like to swim?
I would advise you strongly to do what the boss asked you to do.
This just doesn't make sense.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
I've been waiting for you for a long time.
He looks healthy.
Everything is all arranged.
I deserve it.
She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
I really miss you a lot.
The museum is open to the public.
How long have you been dating?
I had to stop.
I bought a red tie.
I gave the beggar all the money I had.
They can't hear you.
The wedding ceremony will be held regardless of the weather.
Tom started crying.
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me.
Tom sneezes a lot.
He said that if he knew her address, he would write to her.
Don't forget to answer the letter.
Finding it hard to make ends meet on his income, she started to work.
The cat jumped onto the table.
I continued working.
Tom seems lost.
Rich soil yields good crops.
I know you're busy, too.
The night is still young.
Tom doesn't know what he's doing, does he?
I'd like to kiss you.
It wouldn't hurt.
This is going to be easy.
There are only 28 days in February.
Tom saw Mary waiting at the bus stop.
I know Tom is done.
I have to buy something for Tom.
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs.
We arrived there before noon.
I guess we could try doing that.
Where do you get off telling me that?
I can't do that with you because I don't have enough money.
Are you in a good mood?
Can you read what that says?
I am yours and you are mine.
I can't believe I forgot about this.
She went shopping elsewhere.
You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?
Children are often very good at learning foreign languages.
The phone was off the hook.
I feel protected.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
I was as surprised as you.
He unbuckled his belt.
I didn't know where else to go.
Are you productive?
Get in the car, please.
I went to the station.
Are they friends of yours?
The box was full of books.
She is a famous singer.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
They will hold talks tomorrow.
He is no fool.
He knows nothing about politics.
She went off with her friends.
I hate it when Tom and Mary fight.
You have to learn how to compromise.
We regard him as the best player on the team.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Open this door.
I don't want to know.
What was it?
It's a classic.
We can't go back.
Don't give in to peer pressure.
This is by far the most interesting of all his novels.
Food is essential for survival.
I found the book easy.
He went to America last week.
Tom is three years older than you.
Did I touch a nerve?
Go back to your room.
Don't try this at home.
You want me to do your dirty work for you, don't you?
Can I change the channel?
Tom will be back very shortly.
I've studied French, remember?
How long were you alone with Tom?
I could tell you that I love you, but I'd be lying.
They never found out the truth.
Do you weigh more than Tom?
I think you should see a doctor.
I hope you won't expect results immediately.
He wrote down all the details.
He is clumsy with his hands.
This is awesome.
I've never seen anything like that.
Nobody here smokes.
Throw me the ball.
I grew up without a father.
Be kind to those around you.
Tom knows who stole your car.
Maybe we can find someplace to park further up the street.
Everyone knows Bell invented the telephone.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
He thinks he's so great.
How far is it from New York to London?
I had the same problem when I was your age.
Try to avoid junk food.
He walked in front of me.
We're here to play basketball.
Tom said no.
Tom held his breath.
He's no saint.
You're very attractive.
You can't smoke here.

Your coat is very beautiful.
I couldn't figure out how to do it.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
She is a college student.
Don't I have some say in this?
This was his one and only hope.
His story is much more interesting than hers.
Is that machine still usable?
I opened one eye.
Life is hard.
I don't think that I want to study French with you.
She lived a long life.
Tom has green eyes.
You need to lower your standards.
It's not my job to do that.
It is pretty warm today.
I need to learn Japanese.
Are you saying I have no sense of humor?
When did you fire Tom?
Don't even think about it.
You were perfect.
They fell into the conversation immediately.
Answer me right now.
He lives far away from his hometown.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
Let's party.
He is always kind to animals.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I'll sleep on it.

What are you snickering about?
I don't appreciate being interrupted.
One-third of the six members were women.
Why don't you go on a diet?
I haven't seen you for a while.
This highway saves us a lot of time.
I feel like doing something different today.
Don't deny it.
It wasn't exactly a piece of cake.
Tom didn't tell Mary everything.
You got what you wanted, didn't you?
I couldn't stand it any longer.
Yesterday he came back late.
I want you to know that.
How did you reply?
They're just words.
Surely he'll phone me tonight.
A green banana is not ripe enough to eat.
Tom played the cello.

Tom was real happy.
I go for a walk every day, except when it rains.
Are you ready to party?
Your French is good.
I'd like some more bread, please.
How many guards were there?
The shower doesn't work.
Do you want your old job back?
Go ahead and take one.
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
I know that there was a big church here.
I would like to thank you for your collaboration.
Give me some coffee if there is any left.
Before going to France, my son is going to study French.
I'm not a kid.
What do you want me to do about it?
Can you show it to me?
I think we should head back.
Tom is wearing a new uniform.
I baked it for you.
What are you doing tonight?
I know you want to make me happy.
I've already considered that.
Give us a ride downtown.
It's OK as long as it doesn't get windy.
I thought you wanted this back.
I wish I had more time to talk to you.
Did you just call me a monkey?
My cat rubbed her head against my shoulder.
I didn't notice.
I figured you'd be here.
I think I've persuaded Tom to help us.
I'm strong enough.
I plan to never get married.
The wound left a scar on my arm.
We had a very good time last night.
I'll tell you all I know about it.

Tom is watering the flowers.
Tom didn't see that one coming.

I bought a new camera.
Don't dwell on your past mistakes!
I want you to help me with my homework.
It has happened before and it will probably happen again.
It's time for bed.
The salesclerk will come to help you right away.
I've never stolen anything in my life.

The news finally reached me last night.
He entered the army.
Save yourself.
I can come if you want.
Let's take a trip to New York.
I heard you switched majors.
Tom is doing everything he can to save money.
You're finicky.
Tom volunteered.
Whatever you do, don't open that door.
She didn't even try to help.
You bought the food, so if I buy the wine that will even things up.
He went to New York on Monday.
Some of the crew were drowned.
The Geneva University Library has a good reading room.

The prince asked the little girl why she was crying.
I think Tom recognized me.
I don't want to answer that question.
You're a good guitarist. "I'd like to think I am."

We are accustomed to wearing shoes.
I could fix that easily.
There's been a change of plans.
That could've happened to me.
My father implied our summer trip was arranged.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
He does not understand modern technology.
I think Tom needs medical attention.
Give me the keys to your car.
It's been exciting and stimulating.
He writes in his diary every day.
The sea is calm.
I had to make a choice.
I lost my wallet.
I just want to be different.
Why are you being so negative?
Whose turn is it next?
I walked to school.
We'd better do something about this leak.
I'm firing you.
Tom isn't a minor.
I'd never hire Tom.
He is good at playing tennis.
I'm fed up with English.
I stayed home to rest.
Could you knock a little off the price?
I know Tom is almost deaf.
It's a matter of pride.

You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Tom seems to be much happier than Mary.
I baked it this morning.
How can I get to heaven?
My printer is low on ink.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
Don't forget to extinguish your cigarette.
Do you like Moscow?
They're able to sing.
You don't have to blame yourself for that.
You're not making this easy.
To the best of my knowledge, the rumor is not true.
Many families eat dinner while watching TV.
You can come to visit us anytime you want.
They went their separate ways.
She's playing Monopoly.
I'm sorry that I didn't reply sooner.
I don't know how I've offended you.
He walked ahead of me.
We've got a little time to relax.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
I'll be there tomorrow.
I missed a golden opportunity.
You have such beautiful eyes.
Does Tom have a beard?
We don't live in Boston.
I'm a big fan of golf.
Nobody was hungry except me.
You're in serious danger.
You'd better go in person.
Is there somebody sitting in this seat here?
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
I need the keys.
His smile put her at ease.
Is Tom on this ship?
I was afraid to say anything.
So far everything is all right.
Turn around, please.

Nobody wants to play chess with me.
He's getting more and more stubborn with age.

Today is Saturday.
The moment I walked into the room, I knew something was wrong.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
I prefer red wine to white wine.
He boasted about his skills.
You said it was important.
I've already tried doing that three times.
They're broke.
I'd like to talk with you.
Take two of these red pills.
I know Tom is frightened.
We welcome you to our club.
There is a TV remote control under the couch.
Tom vanished without a trace.
You're so impatient.
The police arrested the pickpocket in the act.
Goodbye!
I found a French-Hebrew dictionary at a small bookstore.
I confessed my sin.
I like this time of day.
It's a fact.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Tom didn't attend today's meeting.
We must destroy the evidence.
I turned right.
You should give up smoking and drinking.
Get out your notebooks and pens.
Tom doesn't need to go.
Suddenly, it looks bigger.
The two politicians met face to face for the first time.
I'll work.
The clock is defective.
No one's prepared.
She scolded him.
Don't leave town.
I do not accept your excuse.
I know you're not like that.
She decided to go.
I think Tom is still in Boston.
What do you want in return?
We're disappointed.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
Tom is wearing a strange-looking hat.
The clock is ticking.
Could you please tell me again where you put the key?
I still don't know.
It's just a dream.
Go ahead and talk.
I was looking forward to this.
This summer resort is no longer as popular as it used to be.
She tied him to the chair.
It is too early to get up.
There's a secret passage.
He's asleep.
I think you're right.
The door opened.
They look like they're having fun.
Tom died last year.
They begged us to help them.
I thought you might want to know.
Smell this flower.
The passengers remained calm.
You will soon come to like this town.
I don't care who's responsible.
I don't know how to use a VCR.
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
I can't eat that food.
She always speaks English.
I have way too much stuff.
I had to pay 5 dollars in addition.
Are you going to sing with us?
I was afraid I'd never see you again.
His dream came true.
I thought you already had one.
What do you think of these shoes?
You have nothing to be afraid of.
I no longer believe that.
May I leave this book with you?
She was laughed at by her friends.
She entered this school last year.
Where is the captain of this ship?
He had a book in his hand.
What's wrong with that?
At least thirty students were absent.
I never noticed.
I suppose you like her.
I wonder who wrote this report.
He loves us.
I'm very sorry that I lied.
I attended the meeting yesterday.
You can't count on his help.
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
We're all here.
What else can you do?
You have to learn standard English.
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't been helping me.
There is almost no violence in that city.
Did you forget to do your homework?
Mary has stopped smoking.
You must leave.
I've already finished my work.
They were lucky.
I'm not a teacher.
That would've been the right thing to do.
Are you absolutely sure that it was Tom you saw?
Tom and Mary live in a quiet residential neighborhood.
I know myself very well.
Don't give up.
You're not allowed to swim here.
How did your parents meet?
Boys are not welcome.
The burglar was traced by one of the things he had left on the scene.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
I am ready to do anything for you.
Go grab a drink.
I didn't know he had a weak heart.
How old were you when you did that?
You get out only what you put in.
How often do you wash your hair?
What are you suggesting?
Our teacher looks very young.
To drive a car, you need a license.
She wrapped the present in paper.
It is almost three.
What did you open it with?
I like your place.
We saw guards coming toward us, so we hid in the bushes.
I gave Tom a huge hug.
That's not important for you to know.
I ran out of gas.
Do you like oysters?
How did you get here so fast?
He went out the window.
Who taught you how to do that?
The action took place in a mountain village.
We had a large audience.
Unfortunately, Tom wasn't there.
How high is that mountain?
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Is it something you can get rid of?
What are you hiding?
She made her point.
Could I have a pillow and blanket?
I don't have proof.
I would rather starve than work under him.
I'm unhappy.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
I had no idea.
She takes everything for granted.
The cap is too small for me.
I was delayed by a traffic jam.
The monks are meditating.
I want you to tell me who gave you that.
I've been thinking a lot about you.
The economy of Japan is still stable.
They have been busy.
Is there more?
I'd prefer to only hire people to translate into their native language.
Tom didn't want to marry a woman who wanted children.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
You'll get there by three o'clock.
Tom suffers from claustrophobia.
It's been three years since we got married.
It's my own fault.
I'm satisfied with my job.
Tom will be back home soon.
Maybe it's true.
I know you've got more important things to do.
This is why I hate him.
Why don't you play something for me?
The girl has a soft heart.
I need a coat.
I'm fasting.
I don't understand what you are saying.
I'm glad you decided to come.
I still don't think you should be doing that.
He likes to play rough.
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.
You don't really want this job, do you?
Their goods are of the highest quality.
No one could deny this.
He let me work in this office.
The water's cold.
We walked around the pond.
You won't feel a thing.
Both Tom and Mary don't like spinach.
How do you console a woman who has just lost her only child?
I had the chance to buy that, but I decided not to.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
There's something not quite right.
I remember everything you tell me.
I'll give Tom whatever he wants.
Do you like rap?
I don't understand why Tom brought you here.
She's not confident about the future.
I'm sure a lot of people would agree with you.
Things got out of hand.
Don't you understand what's going on here?
Don't do that.
Does Tom still want to eat with us?
Are you still thinking about applying to Harvard?
I am fat.
She is anxious about her safety.
I dropped my keys.
Tom speaks French much better than he speaks English.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
He can't swim like she can.
Wear whatever you want.
We have had a lot of snow this winter.
I think it's time for me to shove off.
What would you like for breakfast?
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
You were very busy, weren't you?
They were enjoying themselves.
Please bring me some glasses.
He made an important discovery.
I'd like to speak with you.
Tom doesn't want to see you.
I guess you'll need some help.
You're not in charge.
I had a situation to take care of.
Watch what you're doing.
He acted like he owned the place.
You've been drinking, haven't you?
She is a little shy.
Heads I win, tails you lose.
It was my turn to straighten up the room.
I'm tired of hearing you moan and groan.
According to the weather forecast, it will snow tomorrow.
Won't you go shopping with me?
The English lesson started at 8:30.
I thought Tom said it was a dog.
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
Have you met anyone yet?
Who's there?
The dog nipped at me.
The President spoke to the nation on TV.
My parents have just arrived at the station.
I never thought I'd see her there.
It's good to see you again.
I don't ever want us to be apart.
I had fun last night.
It's not raining yet.
I have to get away from here.
He isn't at home, is he?
I'm surprised Tom won.
I think we'll get there before noon.
You won't be fired.
Let's take a group picture.
She gave him a massage.
Express yourself as clearly as possible.
Do you have anything in mind?
I'd really like to go now.
You're feeling very sleepy, aren't you?
Some days seem to just drag on and last forever.
I thought you were older than me.
He was present at the meeting yesterday.
I'm restless.
Tom will be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
It rained all day.
Tom said you were in Boston.
We eat more processed food than natural food.
Make a copy of this report.
I don't want to be your friend.
I have a lot of old books. A couple of them are quite valuable.
Somebody saw you.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
Don't take me for granted.
He has a head on his shoulders.
They won't be selling anything.
You are a teacher.
He asked for a drink of water.
A hammer was used to break the window.
Is Tom staying at the Hilton Hotel?
Have you asked if they want one?
I know you helped Tom.
What is happiness?
She is just going shopping.
The lost boy was identified by his clothes.
I must apologize for not having written for such a long time.
We got along famously.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Maybe you should go to Boston.
What happened to him?
Tom watched them carefully.
My boyfriend is not a loser.
They have information.
It was the most painful thing in my life.
The movie received mixed reviews.
I've heard it all before.
Do you smoke?
He appreciates Japanese culture.
Yesterday was Monday.
She has had to stay here.
She agreed with him on what to do with the old car.
Who won?
Normally, I stay at home on Sundays.
If only he had known!
Turn left at the second traffic light.
We can't afford it.
You don't seem very pleased.
I love my brothers and sisters.
He gave me clothes as well as food.
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
I have a pretty dog.
Tom is a speech therapist.
I don't care what people think.
Look at the cloud over there.
Tom undressed and got in the bathtub.
No one here seems to want our help.
Why would you want to share this type of information with people you hardly know?
I'm calling in sick tomorrow.
She speaks Hebrew with her mother and Polish with her father.
He called me a taxi.
My house is covered by insurance.
Seoul is the capitаl of South Korea.
Don't let this ruin your friendship.
Don't write in red ink.
I'll have to talk to Tom about it.
I'd better not tell you about that now.
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
The city was full of starving soldiers.
This place is arguably the best restaurant in London.
It is impossible to substitute machines for people.
She has traveled all over the globe.
I always obey the rules.
Tom hasn't met Mary.
Is there a problem?
I always make it a point to paint things as they are.
It's hard to swat a fly with your bare hand.
This is the real world.
I can't find the bread.
I've found a better way.
I know that I'm rambling.
She doesn't have the ticket.
She's digging her own grave.
Do you want to pray?
You can't get rid of me.
Does Tom know Mary has done that?
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
The president takes office tomorrow.
He avenged his father.
I have no time tomorrow.
There isn't anybody here.
Someone broke into Tom's house while he was asleep.
Please sing.
I'm not sure what we can do about that.
Did you find your keys?
Don't you know how dangerous it is to go swimming by yourself?
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
She has a small house.
You lost an earring.
Can we reschedule?
Tom shouldn't have done what he did.
I think you'd better give up.
I had to get some help.
Tom had to clean his room.
How are you today?
How much time do you spend on Facebook?
He turned Christian.
I need to make an appointment.
I'm not ignoring you.
Do you agree with this?
A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him around.
Hawaii is a popular tourist resort.
They're talking.
Please remain seated.
Lucky are those who have escaped safe and sound.
They made the decision.
The reason for this is plain.
We want something new.
Is it broken?
It would be sad if that were true.
Have you already eaten supper?
You don't understand what's happening.
I wish the pain would go away.
I think he's a man of ability.
We learned French.
You're not dead.
I thought you wanted this back.
This is the most beautiful sight that I have ever seen.
She has this big room all to herself.
Tom goes to bed at the same time every night.
What are you waiting for?
I don't really have a family.
She gave in to the temptation.
I have plenty of money.
You can do it.
Have you measured it?
Is this really spaghetti?
I haven't seen you for a while.
They're in the shower.
Perfect!
I cannot whistle.
I pay most of my bills on the first of each month.
He sees everything in terms of money.
He is old enough to drink.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
There is little time left.
You may leave your bag here.
Please excuse me for being rude.
All share the blame.
Don't talk to me about work.
Tell them what happened.
Stay here and wait for him.
His play was a hit.
Tom stared angrily at Mary.
He played the piano and she sang.
That's a lot to consider.
You remind me of your brother.
I can't read Tom's handwriting.
This time, you've gone too far.
I don't like what you did to Tom.
Anyone can do that.
His story sounds strange.
Who organized that meeting?
Buy me a drink.
It's all downhill from here.
How long did you stay there?
Where is the railroad station?
Let me paint you a picture.
This container is completely watertight.
It was merely a matter of luck.
Don't pull the plug yet.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
They accused me of being a liar.
I tried to save him.
I have something for you to do.
Everything happened too quickly.
What you're doing makes me nervous.
I miss this place.
Your feet are swollen because your shoes are too small.
I want to see him very much.
It's one of the basic human instincts.
I write in my diary every day.
Tom had to leave early.
How long can a dead language survive?
My father brags about never having had a traffic accident.
How much did you win?
There was something else.
This book was written by Haley.
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
I told you to stay away from me.
I agree with everything you've said.
It will be a great pleasure for me to translate the story and to read it to you.
Tom called Mary every day.
I'll tell you a story.
Nice seeing you!
He came back from America.
Everyone screamed.
Have you confirmed it?
How old are your kids?
You don't need millions to be happy.
Sales fell off in the third quarter.
I learned how to use a hammer from my dad.
Tom didn't look as bored as Mary.
The rebels made a barricade across the road.
We're on the wrong train.
I hope I can manage to make both ends meet.
I wish I could take back all those terrible things I said about you last night.
That hat is very much in fashion.
Where did you park the car?
I've heard that many times.
All that you have to do is to follow his advice.
They're going to give me an estimate.
Well, aren't you glad to see me?
My wife and I did our Christmas shopping in October.
He does not need a wife to look after him.
Are you expecting anyone?
You must not behave like this.
I do not know if it is love.
It's an optical illusion.
One minute has sixty seconds.
The water is hot.
I'm still thirsty.
I'm extroverted.
I don't trust strangers.
Don't be so sensitive to criticism.
Speak for yourself.
We traveled around the world last year.
Don't pick it up.
The car is ready.
Tom does what he wants to.
He came near to being drowned in the river.
She is a beauty.
I convinced Tom to go to the party.
You may go.
He's already a man.
Can anyone help?
It felt like a dream.
Tom left the matter entirely in Mary's hands.
I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
They must be crazy to believe such nonsense.
I second the motion.
That's a big loss.
I saw a fishing boat about a mile off the shore.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
Be on time.
Tom is wearing John's T-shirt.
Don't be late for school.
I like the color of your car.
Why's everybody so quiet?
The new furniture arrived today.
If you could do it, would you do it?
I really wish I knew who painted this picture.
How many times did you do that?
Come join us.
This is so stupid.
I don't want it.
I'm not so confident.
Can you please pass me the newspaper?
Don't step on my toes.
How's your wife?
I'm a teacher, not a student.
She didn't seem interested.
Show me everything.
Due to the reason that I described above, I arrived at a different decision.
He was alone there.
Tell Tom that everyone is here.
I hiccup a lot.
He worked very hard.
I see you are awake.
Whose glasses are these?
I have to study French.
Tom did something wrong.
Is this seat open?
How many times do I have to repeat that she isn't my friend?
I'm a light sleeper.
He leaped over the shallow ditch.
Did you have any trouble?
I'm actually enjoying myself.
I'm glad you brought that up.
What do you think you'd do?
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I relaxed at home last Sunday.
Gunshot residue was found on Tom's hands.
He is as tall as my father.
Are you ready for Christmas?
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
I don't wear makeup at all.
They've all gone crazy.
I was frozen to the bone.
You need to fix this.
Are you going to cut down all these trees?
He could not hold back his tears.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
How old are you? "Sixteen years old".
We spoke briefly.
Why do I have to give this to you?
Do you want to know what I think?
He set fire to his own house.
Our inventory is very limited.
Let me know.
He works at a bank.
They were stuck in the elevator for four hours.
I like grapes.
Tell me frankly.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
I work in Boston. "I work in Boston, too."
Tom described the problem in detail.
He's brighter than they are.
I was really apathetic at first.
No one will talk.
You're young and strong.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
This kind of work makes me hungry.
There's definitely something else.
You're out of order.
Thank you very much.
Have you called the boss already?
I hear he is good at mahjong.
How did you discover that?
No one could deny this.
Do you have an extra key?
I don't have a lot of money, but I get along somehow.
Be proud of yourself.
She writes to her son from time to time.
Do you have an appointment with him?
We're having fun.
She was playing the piano at that time.
I'm at your service.
I'll be grateful if you can do that for me.
Let me go!
The old man sometimes talks to himself.
I am not kidding.
She rejected my proposal.
We're going to search the whole ship.
She wondered where she had lost her purse.
What would I do if something happened to you?
It's not my style.
I had stuff to do so I didn't have time to feel lonely.
Dog food is expensive.
Come with me to the station.
Why are you so grouchy?
Let's clean this up.
I pleaded not guilty.
Who would notice?
The introduction of foreign plants and animals can cause severe damage to ecosystems.
I felt a light touch on my shoulder.
Who wants that?
Tom confuses his right with his left.
Who is currently the richest person in the world?
There were some unexpected questions.
I wasn't good enough.
Have a drink.
He is a potential world champion.
The tigers escaped from the zoo.
I don't really care about that.
I'll be seventeen next year.
I have seen him many times.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
What's your favorite non-alcoholic beverage?
Is there something in particular that you want to watch?
Chivalry isn't dead.
Let me get you some ice.
You've got to be kidding me!
Does it matter to you?
What do you remember?
He ran into the room.
She closed her eyes.
A trip to Hawaii will cost you about 200 dollars.
I assure you that I can do that.
Are you sure you're not tired?
How does it feel?
What souvenirs did you buy?
I asked my son what he really wanted.
I kept my word.
We met on Sunday.
We had known him for five years when he died.
There is no future in this job.
You're the nicest girlfriend I ever had.
Come into the room.
I wanted to hear you say that.
Tom should do as Mary suggests.
I went to bed early.
The traveler stopped to ask me the way.
Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.
Don't read in this room.
That's not enough.
I don't believe in karma.
Don't forget that.
You will need a bodyguard.
He played tennis.
Am I bothering you?
I don't know how to drive.
Maybe your earring is under the table.
The wind blew her hat off.
Who is the man who was talking with you?
Give me the wine.
I explained the rules of the game to them.
After the revolution, France became a republic.
Her friends waited for her by the gate.
Which one will you choose?
He became a nice young man.
Are you still working for Tom?
Would you like one?
He walks to school.
I want to see you in my office right now.
He wasn't able to reach his goal.
You need to be more careful.
The old man died last week.
Turn right at the next intersection.
I just want to sleep in a nice soft bed.
Look at that bird.
Can you ride a bicycle?
I think you need some rest.
I couldn't sleep.
Go away.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
No problem.
Summer has arrived at last.
I am not ready yet.
I feel like I've known you forever.
It is not easy to be understood by everybody.
Tom likes cheese.
I was slightly surprised.
I thought you'd gone home.
That didn't surprise me at all.
I can't put up with this smell.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
Look at that mountain.
I'd like to hear more about that.
I'm going back home tomorrow.
She advised him to come back at once.
They spent the entire day on the beach.
We're all on the same team.
This is where you're wrong.
He was talking nonsense.
Do you like playing volleyball?
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
Don't shout.
May I talk to you for a second?
She is two years younger than me.
Are you getting paid for this?
Your hair is beautiful.
I won the fight.
We're relaxed.
You are apt to be forgetful.
I wish you'd called first.
What time do you leave?
I only saw him once.
He needs to be the center of attention.
Tom doesn't like to sing.
I think that he's probably not a bad boy.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
Was anybody in there?
It was a complete disaster.
Is it worse than before?
Do you like sports?
I can easily give up chocolate to lose weight.
I did have fun.
Tom died yesterday.
I am sure that he will become a great singer.
I have doubts.
That's the part I don't like.
I have another friend in China.
He will have been working for five hours by noon.
We must do more than yesterday.
My mother is in the kitchen.
He's in my class.
What did you say your name was?
A man is known by the company he keeps.
I want you and Tom to do that together.
I didn't know what I should say.
The old man tends to exaggerate.
Who can blame you?
Are you here to arrest me?
Christmas is coming soon.
They cut a hole in the ice and swam in the freezing water.
She became a singer.
May I see your invitation please?
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
This is appalling.
They're cannibals.
Tom came into the room without knocking on the door.
She's out shopping for shoes.
We all care for one another.
I figured I'd find you here.
We won't be judged.
You've gone too far this time.
We finally have you where we want you.
The tree fell down.
It took one week to locate their hiding place.
Who does your decorating?
I like your new hair color.
Let's say you're right.
What gave it away?
The robber bashed her head in.
Industrial countries require a lot of skilled labor.
It is said that the poor are not always unhappy.
I just want to be a little happier.
Do you own a house in Italy?
That's exactly how I want it.
I slept for nine hours.
Tom wasn't violent.
Tom was better.
What has happened to the book I put here a few moments ago?
I don't really know you.
I don't know what to do.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
Dad needs to take a rest. He's been working in the garden for three hours.
I don't have to do anything right now.
You should try to see it.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
Tom doesn't have a TV at home.
Don't forget to call your parents.
This is really too much.
Did I miss something this morning?
Go and wake Tom up.
I don't think I have one of those.
This is my sister.
I had my doubts about you.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
We need a tool to open it with.
Have a drink.
I had to get away from here.
Tom is an economist.
Is everything satisfactory?
I go to the country every summer.
She was the last to cross the finishing line.
Tom doesn't have a dad.
Why did you come home so late?
I've made up my mind to give back all the money I stole.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
Each time I see Mary, I learn something new and important from her.
Tom can't do anything about that.
I want to know where it is.
I'm one of Tom's teammates.
Is that your car in the driveway?
I'm sure everything will be fine.
You get out only what you put in.
The only thing that Tom drinks is coffee.
I figured you'd want to know.
I already feel better.
He seemed to know everything about me.
He lacks motivation.
Do you have a problem with what was suggested?
Go on.
You look just like him.
How much is the entrance fee?
I'm going to protect you, Tom.
You must make up for the loss.
He is eager to go there.
I heard the leaves rustling.
Does she know your phone number?
I am sorry. I am not from here.
I'd like to go, too.
I fixed it.
I started crying.
He began by saying that he would not speak very long.
Tom thinks it's stupid.
Good luck with that.
Are you two going out together?
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
How about dining out tonight?
I will finish it by tomorrow afternoon.
He is a man of character.
Why didn't you tell us that?
That's all I wanted.
What if you're wrong?
I know what we can do.
We're all bored.
I saw her five days ago, he said.
Please let me know the schedule beforehand.
They're not following.
Distilled water has no taste.
He avenged his father's death.
Why not start now?
You seem upset.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
Are the children at school?
I met her by chance on a train.
Tom doesn't understand French at all.
Don't be so negative.
There's my team.
Life is getting hard these days.
You don't seem very concerned.
Why are you worrying about something that doesn't matter so much?
Even now, I occasionally think I'd like to see you. Not the you that you are today, but the you I remember from the past.
Get on with it.
Can you stay and watch the children?
That shouldn't be too hard to do.
I took your umbrella by mistake.
We're not fit.
It was a suicide bombing.
What are some foods you can eat to lower your cholesterol?
I made these.
My cold is getting worse.
Hokkaido is to the north of Honshu.
I woke you up.
They are the same age.
I want to see what happens.
Everyone else waited.
I've got to see you.
It hardly ever rains there.
You know what they can do, don't you?
Someone must've stolen your watch.
Tom handed Mary a cup of hot coffee.
I can't force you to do anything.
Many people put too much personal information on social media.
I know how proud you are of your work.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
Can I be of help?
He's right behind you.
These are his pens.
What do you think that means?
When I run, I get sweaty.
There was absolutely nothing you could do about it.
Let me know your address.
Tom doesn't think it's his fault.
A telephone is something you can't do without.
Most children love ice cream.
Thousands of people gathered there.
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
We've all done things we're not proud of.
Please help yourself.
Check these out.
If it is fine tomorrow, we will play baseball.
It's not safe there.
He was standing.
They built a snowman together.
He raised his hat when he saw me.
I wish you had told me that.
I know Tom is in the garden.
Some families spend their vacation near the beach.
Does Tom have a fishing license?
It's going to be tricky.
I must find some new friends.
I was leaving home when Tom telephoned me.
Tom is ashamed of his body.
We all cheered.
I told you guys to go home. Why are you still here?
He faced toward the sea.
They visited their parents yesterday.
I can't help feeling something's wrong.
You're no fun at all.
She passed the examination.
I enjoyed your company.
Why are you so quiet?
We're not entirely sure.
I've already taken care of everything.
I don't blame you for the accident. It wasn't your fault.
Don't keep me in the dark about it.
She has been to Paris.
Did I write that?
I want to be involved.
Is that even possible?
The line is busy now. Please hold the line.
Be a good girl.
Mary is being careful with her baby.
I can't do this anymore.
We have to move.
Why did you come early?
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party.
I drank some of the milk and kept the rest in the refrigerator.
What shall we do?
We've only got three more days.
I don't know where I'd begin.
What is your problem?
We're getting out of here.
We have the best food in town.
I'll protect you.
Would you like to eat something?
You should be more careful at a crosswalk.
I'll leave it up to you.
I saw a dog.
Do you study French every day?
I figured it was better not to go without you.
Our apple tree is blooming.
You don't have to blame yourself for that.
Are you free this weekend?
I have questions.
You must do this alone.
You look satisfied.
I always confuse which side is port and which starboard.
We should hang out sometime.
Yes, I know it.
Don't rush things.
The pyramids were built in ancient times.
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.
When did you find out that Tom didn't have to do that?
I know you're not coming to my party, but I wish you were.
I'd bet my life on it.
I'll be here until next week.
I don't need your help.
He's good at arithmetic.
He acted as my guide.
He abandoned all hope.
I traveled around Europe.
He let me go.
You'll sleep better tonight.
Learn to walk before you run.
I am happy with my girlfriend.
Are you finished with your work?
She was wearing a negligee.
I caught a glimpse of him in the crowd.
I'm sorry for the late response.
You're a wonderful friend.
Can you do it faster?
No one will ever forget this.
Give me a sec.
I think we can go faster.
She forgot that she bought him a present.
I heard him humming in the shower.
Hang on tight.
I think I know why you're here.
Get back in the van.
What did your wife say?
I'm glad things went so well.
I tried to learn the melody by heart.
I don't even have a single girlfriend.
Do you like this garden?
Tom found a job as a mechanic.
How did you get them?
I'm sorry, my father is out.
She was looking forward to going sailing with him.
Please come.
He called at my house.
He began to learn English.
I prefer white chocolate to dark chocolate.
I thought you might need some help.
Gesture is another way of communication.
I liked having you here tonight.
The earth goes around the sun.
Tom never used to eat so much junk food.
Please don't tell anyone else.
I could hear Tom yelling.
Loosen up.
I don't like spoiled children.
If you have time, let's go shopping.
He began to cry.
I've had enough.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary so much.
We're still alive.
I assumed you were happy.
You have such beautiful eyes.
Don't eat for at least three hours.
Are you recording this?
Send me a new catalog.
I'm very impressed by your work.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
He drinks a lot of milk every day.
Was this somebody else's idea?
Are you sure about that?
It has become quite common.
I don't really have a gun.
She attacked him with her fists.
There are a lot of problems we can't avoid.
Please lock the safe.
I'm so glad Tom won the race.
Tom went back to his own room and lay down.
He is hard up for money.
Something did happen, didn't it?
Tom was only three minutes late.
He was sick, but he went to school.
This type of thing never used to happen here.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I don't want you to go back to Boston.
All of a sudden, three dogs appeared in front of us.
Yesterday, as I was walking along the street, I saw an accident.
Tom didn't want to kiss Mary.
When did you quit smoking?
I can see it in your eyes.
Did that work?
This makes me very happy.
I just got off duty.
Tom and I love each other and that's the only thing that matters.
That is an old castle.
I wear designer clothes myself.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
It's against my principles.
Hurry up, girls.
She's very afraid of snakes.
I just wanted to go to college.
Do you want to take a break?
It was rather funny.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
The trees were in a row.
The time for talking is over.
He is able to play the guitar.
I'm not a patient man.
She's lost her car key.
If anyone can do that, it's Tom.
I like coffee and toast for breakfast.
What he said was not true.
You are both pretty and kind.
He apologized to us for having broken his promise.
You have very sexy legs.
I have already done it.
A new bridge is being built over the river.
I'm not your son.
Tom seems to be intimidated.
Tom left me with no choice.
Stay here.
I have to take the chance.
Now everything's going smoothly.
We don't have as much in common as I thought we did.
I'll never let you down.
I know it very well.
How many times have you done this?
We know each other quite well.
The sound of a gunshot echoed across the canyon.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
It is a kind of orange.
Whose guitar is this?
Please don't die.
Tom's hungry.
The girls danced to music.
School's not fun.
Who's the loser?
I wonder where Tom hid his key.
We can't just drive around all night.
He's a bit shy.
I want them.
What magazines do you subscribe to?
I always wear a watch so I know what time it is.
He worked through the night.
I can't bear to work with him.
This conversation is being recorded.
It's a monster storm.
I'm unbiased.
I just want to be his friend.
Now that school is over, you can go home.
I'm going to shoot him dead.
Tighten this screw.
He thinks he's a genius.
This chair is Tom's.
Bring me today's paper, please.
I don't want to think about what could have happened.
I thought you said you couldn't eat raw fish.
I'd prefer to not take that risk.
Is this the first time you've eaten Japanese food?
How are you going to stop Tom?
I lost my favorite pen.
He mocked me.
She has tried various methods of slimming down.
You're very attractive.
I want to hear more about this.
He is playing in his room.
How many kinds are there?
Did I interrupt something important?
Tom managed to do everything he was supposed to do.
That's what I told him.
You're doing the right thing.
It was the only way.
He's intelligent.
I can hardly walk.
It was quite an experience.
We arrived at the museum after a ten-minute walk.
It's worse than I thought.
I just had this suit cleaned.
I'm still your friend.
Tom has eyesight problems.
Were there any problems?
Tom sings in a church choir.
May I be of service?
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.
Tom doesn't have either a cat or a dog.
You didn't miss the meeting.
Wish me luck.
Are seats available?
Could you make it a little shorter for me?
He is not the man that he was when I first knew him.
I'd like to go with you, but I can't.
I need a bigger challenge.
Tom doesn't know how to milk a cow.
I appreciate what you've done for me.
Why did you do it?
His name was becoming widely known.
I can't go with you.
Take your coat in case it rains.
You'll get a lot of presents on your birthday.
Not all English people like fish and chips.
He agreed to give us an interview.
Let's take a look.
Don't let opportunities pass by.
She has abundant hair.
Good luck on the test!
What kinds of things do you enjoy doing?
Love will survive.
Whose suitcase is that?
The Smiths are our neighbors.
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
I like watermelon.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
I've got to learn some new songs.
Tom greeted us warmly.
Do you really think that your plan is realistic?
Who are you going with?
I may have something for you.
I'm seeing you in a new light.
Can't you understand that it's impossible?
Tom was very scared.
I want to ask you about the money you found.
You drive.
Christmas is only two weeks off.
I just want you back.
I'll walk you to the gate.
When did you get married?
Is this what you were looking for?
I'd like to eat somewhere else.
That can't last.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
Who is Tom?
I'll give you this money.
I played with Tom and Mary today.
Why are we still fighting?
I was hurt by many people.
You are early.
I have lost my umbrella.
You promised.
He knows that you know.
We know you're not stupid.
Are they selling their house?
He got all his information from secondary sources.
What happens next?
What did you open it with?
This is revolting.
You are going too far.
He came several times.
I do this for a living.
Fill the bucket with water.
Try this cake.
Tom wants to come to our party.
Are you busy today?
They always go skiing in the winter.
What's your favorite programming language?
You've probably heard of us.
I'm trying.
Be more flexible.
My aunt treats me as if I were a child.
He dozed off.
She has to take in the waist of her pants a bit.
What time will you be back?
Tom takes good care of his horse.
His nose bled.
What can I help you with?
I didn't see you.
The office is empty.
Tom bought a gun in Boston.
You don't have to lie.
She rejected my proposal.
Since I had a cold, I was absent from school.
They really hate each other.
Tom is convinced everybody hates him.
Tom doesn't brush his teeth as often as he should.
I find that fascinating.
You can expect to receive a little something from us soon.
I really enjoyed myself.
Are you afraid of something?
Did I give you enough time?
Look what happened.
I'm too tired to concentrate on this problem right now.
You must be back by 10 o'clock.
I told Tom not to use those.
I wonder if you'd help us.
Tom said he wanted that.
Leave me alone!
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
You're arrogant.
This is a real diamond, isn't it?
I remember now.
I want to eat meat and vegetables.
Guess who's coming for dinner.
Did I miss anything?
I was unlucky.
That's too easy.
Let's go back inside.
What a beautiful town!
When will you call?
Come home at once.
I don't care who your father is. You still have to follow my orders.
I started it.
They can't push us around.
I heard a loud explosion.
You have a lot of work to do.
I now agree with Tom.
I want to do some shopping around here.
Let's do this first of all.
They all killed themselves.
Almost all of the dogs are alive.
You're trustworthy.
I don't need looking after.
He dedicated his life to medicine.
Defense lawyers appealed for mercy.
Corn is an important crop in the United States.
We've got to get you out of here.
I want you to admit you were wrong.
I know that I haven't been a very good father.
I hope you're wrong.
Could you tell me the way to the station?
That girl is Mary.
That's peculiar.
Tom says that's a lie.
I often go fishing in that river.
My mother doesn't know how to ride a bicycle.
You should run for president.
I had nothing to do with that.
She eats lunch here from time to time.
Be polite to everyone.
I noticed that he had stopped.
We're going to invite Tom and Mary to our Halloween party.
How many different schools have you attended?
Tom eats pizza with a fork, but Mary eats it with her hands.
I think I must be leaving since it is getting late.
I had no friends except for Tom.
All at once, the Buddhist priest burst into laughter, spoiling the solemn atmosphere.
He loves music.
I think she's hiding something.
I am in the garden.
She is a really good girl.
Tom stays home all day.
He ran away when he saw me.
Do you have a cellphone?
I can't help the way I feel about you.
It is very dangerous to cross this street.
I bought Mary a scarf.
I thought your dad took away your credit card.
You won't be shot.
What's the meaning of that word?
You can't drive now. You've been drinking.
What do you think about it? It'd be great!
Do you want me to come cook you something?
I hope everyone is happy.
My daughter's getting all gussied up for her first date.
I should have told you before.
Tom graduated from high school three years ago.
She was advised by him on that matter.
I stuck with it until I was finished.
You have a very pretty name.
I haven't eaten asparagus in a long time.
I was a little disappointed.
He held a pen in his hands.
She teaches English.
I know the feeling.
I will shoot.
I have to go to the bank this morning.
I'm going to the party Saturday night.
He isn't afraid of death.
It's nothing I can't handle.
I don't even know where to begin.
I want you to work harder.
I'm swamped with work.
Are we going for a walk?
If you're not happy, quit.
Let's forget the past and talk about the future.
Do you know how to cook rice well?
I should've told Mary that I loved her.
Tom often walks to school.
He forgot to turn off the light.
I dream about you every night.
You're wasting time.
You should begin right away.
I don't know if I can do this.
They danced all night long.
Any child knows that.
How did you learn how to play the violin?
Don't worry.
He was a man of great ambition.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I'm willing to apologize.
I advised him not to drive.
Tom was found dead in the alley behind the restaurant.
Is this a gift for me?
My friends and I went to a party yesterday.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
Why would you want me?
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
I knew exactly what it was.
I play the piano.
I don't have time now.
Don't stop until I tell you.
I need a shower.
Let's just sit here a while and listen.
He delivered a very long speech yesterday.
I'm happy you two are friends again.
May I move to the other side now?
Give me the keys. I'll drive.
You sound tired.
Do you consider them dangerous?
This can't be what it looks like.
It's a dreary place.
Tom should've been an actor.
What's going to happen?
This has been verified.
He dropped it.
He worked long into the night.
I went not once, but twice.
He was killed in the earthquake.
You won't die today.
Let's end this debate.
Get a job.
We did it.
The earth is similar to an orange in shape.
That's Saturn.
It'll rain soon.
You made a horrible mistake.
People came from all over.
He's incredibly stupid.
Contact me tomorrow.
He spoke with a typical Texan drawl.
I didn't know that this was the first time you kissed a girl.
He adapted himself to his new life.
Stand still!
The train was delayed by snow.
What exactly happened?
Let me save you some trouble.
Freedom is so fundamental that its importance cannot be overemphasized.
The boss said that we are fired.
I've been to the mall.
You look like you're busy.
It's a happy thing.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
We went to a movie.
Don't interrupt.
I have a black eye.
I can't believe you actually did something like that.
I didn't know they could do that.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
Tom picked up some pretty shells on the beach.
We're quite certain of that.
I don't care anymore.
When did he get back?
I'm in love with Mary.
Why are we moving to Boston?
I don't know what you want to do.
It was a massacre.
The older children helped the younger ones.
We're all devastated.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
Would you like to go to the aquarium with me?
Do you speak French?
She's a single mother of two.
I do not like spring.
I'm beginning to get used to doing this.
Are they new?
The method was crude, but very effective.
A huge federal budget deficit has been plaguing the American economy for many years.
I was moved to tears by the story.
I corrected it.
This isn't a real diamond.
He insists on things being done in the most efficient way and he usually does them that way himself.
Tom arrived at the hotel.
He didn't pass after all.
Who wrote this song?
The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union collapsed.
I hate shopping.
Turn off the radio, please.
I wake up at six, but I don't get out of bed until seven.
Excuse me, I'm lost.
Keep it together, Tom.
You can have this book for nothing.
There is a problem.
Which goes faster, a ship or a train?
We have to do better.
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
She thought that I was a doctor.
I still need to buy some bread.
You could at least give me a hint.
How many times have you done this?
Tom bought a bathrobe.
Mumps is an infectious disease.
Do you meet him often?
We can proceed.
The earthquake was the biggest one that we had ever experienced.
You're not a doctor.
We all work.
I have a cat.
Tom told me that he was determined to do that.
That is mine.
I sat down next to him.
I have no time for that, and besides, I don't have any money.
I thought they wouldn't like you.
Nobody wants to work with you.
He did it for the money.
Where did you get the money?
It sounds impossible, but it's true.
We don't have a vacancy at the moment.
I think you need someone to talk to.
Everyone did a fabulous job.
I love you.
You look handsome.
Nobody in my family can do that.
She has no self-esteem.
What good is that to us?
I hope it was worth it.
Tom ate his sandwich quickly.
They don't really care.
That's how I do everything.
I know Tom was stunned.
I'm sorry we can't stay any longer.
Please put that on the table.
I've been dying to see you.
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
May I eat a little of it?
He forgot to come to see me yesterday.
That dress fit her perfectly.
We kept the children quiet.
You get out only what you put in.
You're going to lose.
It's a matter of life and death.
She agreed with my idea.
Give me a hug.
I wonder who took it.
Don't ask me for forgiveness. What's been done has been done.
What is the weather like today?
Your necklace is beautiful.
She wants to attend the party.
I've got a long way to go.
I can do it without your help.
My friends and I went to a party yesterday.
I wash my hands a lot.
What might that be?
I want one, too.
I don't know how many more times I'll be able to do this.
Where did you meet your boyfriend?
That's exactly what I needed.
Someone turned the alarm off.
I've made the same mistakes as I made last time.
I pulled a muscle.
Tom does only what he wants to do.
I stayed with a friend of mine.
I promise you I'll help you.
Is this typewriter yours?
Would you like to go with me?
Tom showed Mary the photo.
Her condition got worse last night.
It's not worth reading any further.
The curtain caught fire.
Listen a minute.
I hope you won't be disappointed.
It's mine, not hers.
I just want you to leave me alone.
He had been living in Nagano for seven years when his daughter was born.
We remained silent.
I'm just an average guy.
The store can supply us with anything we need.
Spare me the grisly details.
I am the tallest in our class.
I can't find it anywhere.
You don't have to justify your decision.
I had to call off the party.
I don't want to give up.
There are a lot of people here today.
The situation is extremely critical.
I think you heard me.
Get your gear.
Did she show you the picture?
You're finicky.
My grandmother never changed her style of living.
Look what I found in the garden.
I am going to work out the problem by myself.
Why didn't you go to the police?
Nobody can help me.
We love our dog.
Just as I was about to go out, it started raining.
You need to be more patient.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
I can't believe that this is real.
I can't wait to shower.
We have the extra-large size, but not in that color.
You're funny.
Do you know Tom?
Tom couldn't do what I wanted him to do.
How old were you when you learned to write your name?
I didn't say you were crazy.
Bulgarian is like Russian.
The storm raged in all its fury.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
I went camping with my family.
I can't eat fruit in the morning.
Would you tell me the time, please?
I enjoyed myself.
I know Tom is your friend.
Everything has been arranged.
I was threatened.
Every time she coughed, she felt a great deal of pain.
Here are the rules.
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. I was focused on something else.
Can he do this job?
Did you study French yesterday?
Don't you speak French?
Children are not allowed in.
That wasn't accurate, was it?
Tom pointed at the security camera.
Tom is milking the cow.
What did Tom give you for Christmas?
A convict has escaped from prison.
I never should've trusted Tom.
I don't think they heard us.
It never occurred to me that I might be wrong.
She was scared at the sight of the dead body.
I still have to finish painting the fence.
Is Tom around?
I sat on the couch.
I can't believe you eat that stuff.
I want to go to the zoo.
If that happened, what would you do?
It could happen to anyone.
Tom told Mary that she should be ashamed of herself.
Here, take this.
Help me out here.
I can't imagine what you're going through.
Tom splashed Mary and she splashed him back.
Right and left are opposites.
I really don't care.
You need to wash your hands.
This tea is too sweet for me.
Help me and I will help you.
Do you think he's really into me?
You had better make use of the opportunity.
She's missed the boat.
Tom and Mary went outside.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
I think that's exciting.
Tom continued talking for a while.
I don't know what to answer.
I can't wait for school to start.
Are both of your sisters as beautiful as you are?
It's terrible.
The climate of Canada is cooler than that of Japan.
Why are you so busy?
What should I say to Tom?
This student's books are new.
We've seen him.
Let's talk about that right now.
I don't like both of them.
What happens next?
We will have to consider each application on a case-by-case basis.
Can I have a cup of tea?
Do you like playing sports?
Thanks for showing me how to do that.
They probably don't know.
They can raise your rent.
I'm proud of my father being a good cook.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
How many pens do you have?
I wanted to be a farmer.
How long have you waited?
We're unhappy.
What time did you arrive there?
I knew that someone would come.
Are there any cute girls in your class?
Luck doesn't exist.
That's not realistic.
I think you'd better take an umbrella in case it rains.
She watched him drawing a picture.
When he saw her letter, he felt somewhat uneasy.
Are you already married?
Don't get ahead of yourself.
Have you been listening to me?
May I be excused?
I have a different opinion on that subject.
That makes no sense.
You've been suspended.
Your eyebrows look weird.
She's very upset.
I let them go.
Don't tell me you can't swim.
Where did you hide it?
She found him standing near the entrance.
He killed that man.
The workers went on strike.
Tom is waiting for you in his office.
I wondered why Tom wasn't drinking.
I'm looking for my passport. Have you seen it?
Do you have any news at all?
He won't live more than one day.
I'd like to ask a question.
I'm bleeding badly.
I don't see what's so great about that.
Come play with us.
Says who? "Says me."
Tom was really crazy.
I need time to breathe.
I'll never make it.
Tom is out, walking his dog.
Tom used to be an electrician.
How can something so wrong feel so right?
Tom seems very opinionated.
When is school over?
It's Christmas.
We can't live without water for even one day.
Let's have some fun.
We'll have to do this ourselves.
This could take a while.
He stuck his pencil behind his ear.
He has bought a new car.
Will you light the fire?
Tom and Mary are still young.
I shook my head and said no.
He threw a rock into the pond.
How much would you want to pay for the tour?
What are your plans for the night?
I'm disappointed that he's not here.
Thirteen percent were opposed.
Maybe he likes you, too.
Don't leave this room.
The letter was written by hand.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
They're boring.
I remember meeting her somewhere.
It was your own choice.
I want to go right now.
I've never seen my cat act like that.
I'm smarter than you.
That doctrine will no doubt lead to serious consequences.
Our teacher doesn't just speak English, but French too.
Do you mind waiting for a minute?
I really didn't mean for this to happen.
You're grown up now.
I feel like this is going to end badly.
The weather is very hot.
Tom certainly spends a lot of time indoors.
You can't smoke in here.
She will have a child next month.
Did you watch the Winter Olympics?
What sort of play is it?
Listen to me carefully.
This music is making me sleepy.
Tom works there.
Keep these rules in mind.
Pretty flowers do not necessarily smell sweet.
I don't mean half of what I say.
Her only pleasure is listening to music.
I suppose anything's possible.
Tom has a hangover.
I like to put an ice cube into my coffee, because it's usually too hot.
I wanna go to Japan.
He devoted a lot of time to study.
He began to sweat.
Do you know a good restaurant?
What is it you do?
I want to know who is in charge.
They all stopped.
He seems to have no sense of humor.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
It's more polite to say thin than skinny.
You're afraid, aren't you?
My house looks to the south.
Are you all set to leave?
We're going out to celebrate.
I wouldn't bet on it.
I'll come without fail tomorrow morning.
There was nobody there.
They carried water in buckets.
Why are you limping?
I sincerely apologize.
This guidebook might be of use to you on your trip.
I wish I were a stone.
Are you still on a diet?
If I forget, please remind me.
Where are my parents?
I've been looking all over for you.
He was snoring loudly while he slept.
I feel like an outsider.
I'm still a member.
I wonder why I feel so lonely when it gets cold.
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.
The post office is just past the bank.
I know Tom is active.
There're no lights.
My annual income exceeds five million yen.
She took him for all his money.
What happened to you? You look miserable.
It appears to me that you are right.
He is not stupid.
A cat can see in the dark.
I was really curious.
I couldn't find it.
I heard the boys singing.
I doubt that.
Where's the cat?
This is the place where the battle took place.
Why don't you want to leave Boston?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Why don't you do that by yourself?
You're the only one who wants to do that, aren't you?
I followed him into his room.
In Japan, the new school year begins in April.
Go away before they see you here.
It hurts so much.
He dislikes unexpectedness and emergencies of any kind.
Our house has seven rooms including the dining room.
Nara is as old as Kyoto.
Spanish is spoken in twenty countries.
We organized a huge party.
I want a book to read on the train.
What do you like about him?
You'd better not go.
Somebody made a mistake.
I worked in a post office during the summer vacation.
I didn't know Tom loved me.
I didn't know that Tom had died.
You're very astute.
He was accused of squandering public funds.
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
Tom is pretty sure everything will go well.
Anyhow let's begin.
He has a large number of books.
Don't speak ill of others.
Please put yourself in my place.
I'm afraid I don't follow.
I actually don't know the answer.
That experience left a bad taste in my mouth.
He got hurt in the accident at work.
I didn't move a thing.
I'm attracted to him.
How do you talk to women?
You don't talk to me that way.
I'll act as a guide for you.
Tom said he didn't know what he was supposed to do.
You are gorgeous.
I don't have time to say this twice, so listen carefully.
You can't go yet.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Corporations are competing to fill the vacuum.
I don't understand this.
Tom is conscientious, isn't he?
My father goes to work by bike.
What time did he get there?
I'm excited about the move.
We make mistakes.
I followed him.
His supervisor gave him a sterling recommendation.
I'm not very confident.
Don't be foolish.
I really don't have much choice, do I?
That's just weird.
She went to Germany to study medicine.
Tom tried to touch his toes.
You have a good reputation.
Tom wishes he could fly.
You work here, don't you?
Bees fly from flower to flower.
Is Sunday the first day of the week?
This box is made of cardboard.
I can't keep my coat on in this heat.
These are questions worth discussing.
I'm extremely disappointed by the quality of the service.
Don't make me say it again.
If we don't have a solution, the least we can do is acknowledge that there's a problem.
I'm going to make some coffee. Would you like some, too?
Perseverance, as you know, is the key to success.
Is she all right?
Where was Tom tortured?
I'd like you to come work for me.
Don't tell me you're not scared.
We had a party outside.
We're as hungry as wolves.
I only have one condition.
He sleeps during the day and works at night.
Time is up.
Saudi Arabia is very rich in oil.
Could you teach me how to play the piano?
You're very wise.
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be homeless.
Turn right at the end of that street.
I hope you follow my advice.
My French is actually not so good.
I will always remember you.
She told me you were sick.
My hands are cold.
You and Tom used to be friends. What happened?
I don't know if this will be enough.
This is appalling.
I can't imagine living like that.
I thought doing this would be easy.
What do you think of my idea?
That's all I knew.
I'll tell him that.
Why don't you let us go?
Tom is a cold-hearted murderer.
Let me get that for you.
So, do you like it?
Were you even tempted?
I saw the person I expected standing there.
My body aches all over.
Are you ready for the trip?
Does this ring a bell?
Come down here and eat with us.
Do you play soccer or rugby?
Come if you can.
The child was hiding in the box.
I'm going to be doing that soon.
It's natural for you to think so.
I did what I believe is right.
What was the time of death?
That's a nice dress.
He was easily able to solve the problem.
I never visit my sister.
I love him more than any of the other boys.
You'd better not go today.
If you're smart, you'll cash out while you're ahead.
I had my money stolen.
I was moved to tears by the story.
Let's get the party going.
You can go back.
I'm going to be your teacher.
Why are you afraid to do that?
The mosque was torched in the middle of the night.
They accused him of telling a lie.
How did you know Tom had a dog?
The house requires repairs.
Why don't you let us go?
She spends most of her money on clothes.
I got a bee sting.
He betrayed you.
Take a bite.
This school supplies students with textbooks.
Both of my parents can't swim.
This is what you're supposed to do.
He died a sad death.
It's a nice thought.
I'd be honored.
Turn down the music.
You didn't keep your word.
I don't know where we'll live next year.
I feel giddy.
Will you be going?
Please stay.
I hope you won't be disappointed.
Let's get off the bus.
Who's the author?
It's OK to take a picture from outside.
I'm a vegetarian.
Don't tell Tom anything.
I was in the mountains.
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.
I thought things would get better, but as it is, they are getting worse.
The town where I was born is beautiful.
Do you know him, by any chance?
You're really annoying.
Wouldn't it be a better idea to cancel everything?
I wish that I could believe you.
I know that plenty of guys want to go out with you.
I'll call you when I arrive in Boston.
He thought of a good solution.
Where was your father?
We must learn to live in harmony with nature.
My sister is married.
You'll have to answer for your behavior.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
Are you prepared for the worst?
Choose any of these pens.
His visits became less frequent as time passed.
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
Who am I to second guess him?
Have you ever seen a whale?
This letter says that he will arrive on Monday.
Your things are all here.
Do we know each other?
How do you know for sure?
Tom is not interested.
You're just the man I want to see.
Tom is lucky, isn't he?
This is our only hope.
Someone stole my bicycle.
I was thinking.
You don't know how bad I want to leave.
Good job!
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Did I hear you right?
Tom introduced me to Mary.
We used to be best friends.
If you have something to say, say it now or pipe down.
That's not uncommon.
My nose is too big.
Let's pitch the tent while it's still light.
She began to sing.
She traveled all over the world.
Do you think that dress suits her?
You're home early, aren't you?
You're still green.
The thieves divvied up the proceeds from their heist.
Who broke the news of her death to you?
Do I need a reason?
I'll be sixteen years old next month.
It looks like we're going to have a white Christmas this year.
I've asked you this question before.
No one can deny the fact that fire burns.
He caught a boy stealing his watch.
Stop spending money on stupid things.
The bus is full. You'll have to wait for the next one.
You're very timid.
The problem remains unsolved.
I'll fix it now.
Please understand my position.
Yesterday I arrived in Tokyo.
I saw something interesting.
No one asked your opinion.
Did you find Tom?
I'm sort of in the middle of something.
Please hand me the bottle opener.
If you want something done right, sometimes you've just gotta do it yourself.
I don't earn enough money to buy clothes regularly.
Thanks in advance.
He is angry with you.
How did you meet him?
Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?
I was a little disappointed.
They were all smiling.
Things have been pretty tough lately.
Why are they always fighting?
Meet me in the lobby.
Japanese industry has made great advances since the war.
Did you buy flowers?
You're very forward.
I'm glad I invited you.
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
This contract is totally ridiculous.
I will come by all means.
Are you ashamed of me?
It happened early this morning.
He played an important role on the committee.
Your threats don't scare me at all.
I got your letter yesterday.
I just wanted to check my email.
Our team did very well.
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
Selfie sticks are banned in many museums and galleries.
There's nothing I can do to help Tom.
I don't have any furniture.
You can't quit now.
This was a great idea.
Are you wearing that dress for the first time?
She asked him some questions, but he refused to answer.
We have no one but ourselves to blame for that.
Her communication skills could be improved.
Is that the railroad station?
There's a possibility of war.
Don't ask so many questions.
Let's eat now. I'm dying of hunger.
Can you do it faster?
I saw him just now.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
Am I under arrest?
What are you doing to stop this?
Our team lost the first game.
I nearly starved.
Tom doesn't know how to ski.
There were no survivors.
He went backstage after the show.
Goodnight, Mother.
It's popular in Australia.
They lived happily ever after.
Can you determine what happened?
The rope broke under the strain.
Can you close the door?
I think maybe we should go.
I like French.
Tom broke up with me.
They took a walk.
I'm 99% sure.
By the end of the century, the earth will have experienced a dramatic increase in temperature.
Tom did his best, but he failed.
That was going to be my next suggestion.
I wrote him a letter asking him to come home soon.
Having finished the work, he went to bed.
She wanted him to say that he would pay the bill.
Tom said he'd call at 2:30.
We don't have any eggs left either.
He has plenty of money in the bank.
I don't know much else.
We have about thirty bottles of wine in the cellar.
Get that book for me.
Somebody's coming.
What's all that for?
Do you have any beer?
The baby sleeping in the baby carriage is as cute as an angel.
I'm falling.
Thanks for adding me as a friend.
This house is famous.
I never want to see you again.
He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
I've been following you.
You'll be the first to know.
Where is your house?
I need to know who you are.
Okay, I'm ready.
Careful driving prevents accidents.
Don't you see what you've become?
I never believed it.
This old coat has had it.
Go back to where you came from.
Can I tell you guys something?
It's cold out there.
I'm still in love with Mary.
He caught a cold.
I go to work by bicycle.
I hate terrorist organizations.
I am grateful to you for your kindness.
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
I got my hair cut today.
Tom can't do anything about it.
How do you take your coffee?
She's very upset.
I'll give you another minute.
We want to talk to you about that.
Tom asked Mary to read him the letter she had gotten from John.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
If you take a nap here, you'll catch a cold.
Don't be fresh with me.
Are you interested in politics?
Don't drink the water.
He made up his mind.
I wish I had a reason not to go.
I refused to pay.
Just be quiet.
He remained single all his life.
It serves you right.
You can't count on their help.
The competition is fierce.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
I've got little time for reading these days.
I have time.
Watch carefully.
Give me your arm.
I don't get it.
They're not evil.
Don't be too hard on me.
How often do you take a shower?
Is there a man in your life?
I like painting, too.
I can't make it any clearer.
My grandmother looks after the children during the daytime.
I'll call you in a couple of days.
I'm training with my friends.
Have a drink.
A cup of coffee, please.
I thought you'd be different.
I knocked, but no one opened the door.
What time do you go to work?
The man sitting over there is a famous singer.
He let me go.
I live in a rural area.
You ought to do it at once.
I wasn't following the conversation.
I hope everyone agrees.
When I heard that song, it reminded me of my childhood.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
I'm homesick.
Is this art?
The banks are closed today.
I bought a new handbag.
Why would you want to leave?
I wanted this.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
It is too dark for me to read.
He says that he saw nothing. However, I don't believe what he says is the truth.
I bet everyone is waiting.
Tom asked Mary to look after the children.
I was overwhelmed.
Do you offer any all-day tours?
I feel so alive right now.
These are questions that matter.
He has long legs.
It's a weapon.
Where do you usually eat lunch?
I can't hear Tom.
Tom's book about his life with Mary sold like hot cakes.
How did you become involved in this project?
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
Let me read you something.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
I am undressing.
At what time does it close?
You're nuts!
Death is preferable to dishonor.
Those who violate the rules will be punished.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
Tom is waiting for Mary's call.
When the desire for leisure is stronger than the other urges, leisure wins.
Please remember to write to her.
I'm not all that smart.
We need to think together about the future of Europe.
How big is it?
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
I was grateful.
Where is the elevator?
Somebody killed Tom.
Tom sipped his coffee.
We have no other choice.
Prices have been rising since last year.
Don't stay in the sun too long.
I don't want to get sick.
I came here to study.
He asked for a beer.
I can't solve this problem. It's too difficult for me.
Do you like it when I do this?
He shot at me.
You must put an end to this foolish behavior.
It's going really well.
I can't do two things at once.
What do you say to going swimming tomorrow?
We have hope.
I got the ticket for nothing.
Tom looked at it suspiciously.
You don't need to tell me your real name.
He found his master.
We'll do whatever it takes to complete the project on time.
I don't feel like drinking vodka.
We have nothing to discuss.
We had no choice but to put up with it.
This book is well written.
I'm getting married this year.
I don't know what's happened.
We really are hungry.
We went to the park to play.
I want to look like her.
It's human nature.
You've got the wrong guy.
I've heard enough.
I wanted to be a teacher.
I have something in my suitcase for you.
I am not too tired.
I'm writing a song in French.
Go grab a drink.
The section chief accepted the proposal.
All I want is your cat.
You were hot, weren't you?
These shoes are too small.
She is no ordinary singer.
You're welcome.
Protesters were picketing outside the company's headquarters.
You were in danger.
I told you it was stupid.
Her watch is ten minutes slow.
I don't have that.
I think I've figured out where we need to install the fire alarm.
Tom hasn't changed a bit since college.
Local shops do good business with tourists.
I always watch the weather report before going out in the morning.
You're in luck.
I've already written three books.
I never thought it would end like this.
Did you catch what he said?
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
Try this.
You're silly.
I'm happy to do it.
You must go to bed now.
I refuse to listen to your excuses.
It's going to rain. Look at those dark clouds.
Tom's phone number's unlisted.
You can stay till tonight.
I think we've wasted enough of our time.
It's their choice.
Tom asked Mary to walk his dog.
Tom could sense something.
Can I begin?
He can play a flute.
You're the one who trained me.
Tom kicked down the door and entered Mary's room.
Tom is looking for his phone.
I dipped my finger into the honey.
Is there anything we could do to help?
Where do you want us to go?
Haven't you eaten yet?
I'll find another job.
I love to take pictures.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
I can wait for you.
I should be studying English, but I'd rather watch a movie.
That sounds very tempting.
I've been looking all over for you.
This church was destroyed by cannon fire.
I wish you had come with us.
It was a miracle that he recovered.
I'd like to buy a washing machine.
How did you get over the difficulty?
Who built it?
Those pictures were painted by him.
I'd like to earn my keep while I'm staying with you.
She played a sonata.
I want to read this book.
They're really good at making clothes.
What did you make?
I just want to keep things nice and simple.
Thanks for your cooperation.
I want to find a way for us to be happy.
Quality is more important than quantity.
I have an old computer that I don't want anymore.
Suddenly, a good idea occurred to me.
I guess it's time to go.
It happened.
I'd love to know that.
I love your son.
Tom rejected the offer.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
What's the most interesting job you've ever had?
Who was this picture painted by?
Why didn't you call the police?
Corporations are not people.
Please note the change in the meeting agenda.
Leave it.
A large pillar obstructs the view of the lake.
You didn't tell me everything.
He denied knowing anything about their plans.
Don't act like a know-it-all.
He cut the advertisement out of the newspaper.
Give me a chance.
The train wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be.
Don't forget to include me in the count.
She lay awake for hours thinking about him.
I lay on my face.
Boys think about girls a lot.
I woke you up.
We're friends.
I'll call you back later.
We think we've found a way to help you.
Are you in any of those pictures?
I want you to look out the window.
Did you really think it would be different this time?
I don't know a thing about her.
You'd better believe it.
Are you afraid of that?
I forgot my scarf.
I have exactly what you need.
I'll go change.
He was a bookkeeper.
I would like it if we could spend more time together.
You're probably too young to understand why we have to do this.
On weekends, I take my dogs out for a long walk in the park.
Tom traveled into the future.
She was a pioneer in this field.
Stay in this room.
They're rich.
Tom spoke louder than usual.
We've made too many bad decisions.
I'm interested.
I strongly advise you to use this.
It's Tom's turn to wash the dishes.
I always tell the truth.
What do you think about Tom?
Many of the people died.
I do my homework after school.
Don't you just hate this kind of movie?
She should help her mother.
Tom disguised himself as a priest.
I hate it when my parents fight.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
His mother looks young for her age.
We needed this weather.
I had a lot of help.
He made a vivid impression.
Tom is always eavesdropping.
You're lazy.
We're not here to talk about music, Tom.
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
Is anybody home?
I think that I smell smoke.
Don't ask me for money.
School is over now.
Write with a pen, not with a pencil.
The girl went to sleep.
I had to run to catch the bus.
I wish the rain would stop.
Are you in Paris?
A swarm of locusts descended on the cornfield.
Tom asked me to come here.
I'm glad you're my friend.
She replied that she had never seen the man before.
A great deal of energy is locked up in the nucleus.
You must kneel at my feet, kiss my hand and swear that I am an angel.
He told me that I should be more careful.
He's kind of cute.
Tom was on time.
Are you studying chemistry?
Is this translation correct?
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
We ate an early lunch while we were at the mall.
You're not dead yet.
I just want to be clear.
Everything's under control.
We're committed.
It's a relief.
You're not a city girl, are you?
Your sister's sleeping.
I really hope you're right.
What do you say we go for a swim?
This chair is yours.
Tom is doing fine.
I got up early in order to attend the meeting.
She can't write or read.
Where did you get on this bus?
She'll lend you a book.
He is sure to succeed.
You look like you saw a ghost.
She bought a chicken.
There's something Tom isn't telling Mary.
He had served as a congressman and senator.
French is very difficult to learn.
What was she like?
Is someone meeting us?
Will you have some more tea?
I spent the whole day in the park.
They defended their country.
What kind of man are you?
I succeeded.
Who is playing the piano?
Take notes.
I don't know what to tell you.
May I try it on?
Does that mean something to you?
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
The more you learn, the more you want to.
I was late for the meeting because of a traffic jam.
Buy low, sell high.
I could feel nothing but the knife as it plunged into my back.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
I'll give it to you.
Tom feels unwanted.
He abuses his authority.
I've lost my umbrella. I must buy a new one.
I think they want you to do it.
I want to learn Korean.
I've always considered you a close friend.
How about my showing you around the town?
I thought it might be you.
You must have lost them.
They say they cannot compete with low-priced foreign products.
Don't be ashamed of yourself.
He has not written to them for a long time.
Stop being cruel.
Can you say that again?
I know how to drive a car.
You drive.
Tom wanted to speak with Mary.
You should've said so earlier.
We watched a movie.
Your eccentricities can make you either charming or tedious.
Tom borrowed my car.
Taste this.
When you watch television or listen to the radio, the music which you hear is often African in origin.
Please don't hurt me.
She told us the road was closed.
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
The phone is ringing. "I'll get it."
The two men sitting on the bench were Americans.
When do you want to eat?
You're not safe here.
I don't understand how this works.
I am interested in chess these days.
Turn it up.
I hate eating alone.
People are staring at us.
His weight strained the rope.
I'm sure that he's happy.
I'll think about it.
She will be back in less than ten minutes.
I don't have a suit.
What happened exactly?
Tom was one of the invited guests.
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry.
I bought a magazine in a store.
When did he go?
There are sentences which everybody knows.
I had to see you.
This rose is beautiful.
He saw it, too.
How do you stand this heat?
I don't even know how old Tom is.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I will follow you wherever you go.
I'm going to play tennis next Monday.
The mirror is very dirty.
You're very clever.
I don't understand this obsession of yours.
I can hardly breathe.
This software package has a suggested retail price of $99.
I don't want to run such a risk.
No one ate the cake.
I always eat something before going to school.
I shave every morning.
We got stuck in traffic.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
It was very good.
Your friends sound nice.
You may use this car.
She's still under age.
All right. I'll take it.
We were both thirsty.
Is there something in particular that you want?
Tom plays computer games for hours on end.
Do we know you?
Everyone was glued to the TV set as the election results came in.
It doesn't matter what I think.
The crew is tense.
Do you want to know why I helped?
This desk is broken.
I'm not sure how we can make that happen.
The car's antenna is built into the windshield.
You're a very attractive woman.
He is, without question, the best man for the job.
Do you remember the town where he was born?
You're scaring the kids.
My license was confiscated.
I can't bear the thought of her with another man.
I love strawberries on Christmas cake.
All you have to do is to concentrate.
The richer he became, the more he wanted.
Put it on my bill.
Tom's doctor advised him to exercise more.
As soon as we find out anything, we will contact him.
Did you get good marks?
A cab is waiting.
She doesn't know what to say.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
When was she born?
I think that Tom is an honest man.
You can't handle it.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
Why would I want to do something like that?
My shirt isn't dry yet.
Say goodbye.
Never forget to put out the fire.
He is not fond of sports, and I am not either.
Don't do anything silly.
Thank you all for being here.
I know someone needs to tell Tom about Mary's death. Does it have to be me?
Tom won't play tennis today.
I already told you he isn't here.
They are not very different from anybody else.
I am in favor of the proposition.
One is never too old to learn.
He never appears before nine o'clock.
Good things come in small packages.
I did that because I was ordered to.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
He is confronted by many difficulties.
How do you plan to get home?
Let me call you back.
He will play soccer tomorrow.
The train arrived on schedule.
The ceiling is very low in this room.
He's an accredited representative of the Canadian government.
Can you drive a stick shift?
I've been told I'm a pig.
I was amazed at his courage.
Where is the cat?
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
It is amazing that you won the prize.
They stayed friends.
This is all he has to do.
Where is he going to settle down?
Did Tom tell you he's studying French?
I hate seeing you like this.
Read what's on the label.
I like to take things apart to see what makes them tick.
We finally have you where we want you.
I want you to get me a soda.
I was deeply impressed by the scenery.
She hated him so much.
You'll have to pay double.
You both want the same thing, right?
I don't like this idea.
Tom likes traveling.
You know where the problem lies.
She insisted on helping me.
You can't pick who you fall for.
Are they taking care of you?
I can't ignore my commanding officer's orders.
He noticed a hole in his jacket, but he tried to ignore it.
You're very busy.
I still don't understand you.
It was a warm day, so we went swimming.
Tell him to mind his own business.
These figures don't add up.
He died of cancer last year.
She is pleased with the dress.
I'm about the same age as you are.
Do you need much money?
He has a lot of money in the bank.
All you do is complain.
He began to sweat.
The countryside is magnificent.
No one could deny this.
His eyes are blue.
It looks like you've lost ten pounds.
What's your favorite smell?
I don't think that he is sincere.
It is hard to win four successive games.
Who allowed him in?
If you ever come to town, come to see me.
Who's causing all the problems?
Have you been told about the problem?
No one likes war.
Tom is behind Mary.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Please do whatever you think is necessary.
It's still mine.
Do you have any idea what they're talking about?
He went away in a hurry.
I've already done most of what needs to be done.
Do you really want to go there?
We had a heavy frost this morning.
Is anything the matter?
The sky was clear when I left home.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Do you like singing?
Drop your gun!
Is this the best you have?
Tom is good at mathematics.
I was thinking about asking her out.
I can't untie this knot.
This system worked well until the 1840s.
How did you do it?
I go every year.
Thank you for your help. "It's my pleasure."
Japan does a lot of trade with the USA.
I met him yesterday.
I can't understand why you are so critical of him.
This really is something.
I ate a salad for lunch.
I suggest we hurry.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
If it rains tomorrow, I'll watch TV.
Hope is not a strategy.
They don't serve that here.
He would be very glad to hear the news.
I received your message.
Are you on crack?
It was all done.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
If you could manage to go camping with us, we'd be delighted.
Who did you go with?
I plan on skipping lunch.
It's cold today so button your coat.
Don't let the children monopolize the television.
Stop, or I'll shoot.
What time is your curfew?
I had no idea you were so young.
May I borrow your phone?
Tom and Mary seem so happy together.
Anyone can use this dictionary.
I only have one sister.
I have to study.
What's a porcupine?
I'm going to catch the next bus.
I think I'm going to be sick.
I highly doubt Tom wants to see you.
He likes sleeping.
He grasped the rope with two hands.
You know that I love you.
I study French at school.
You should be very proud of yourself.
I'm glad you came over.
I told Tom where I'd bought my hat.
Let me show you where to put that.
How soon will the meeting begin?
Let's decide on the date for the picnic.
I gather you were hurt.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Tom broke his leg in a cycling accident.
He has a few pens.
Tom introduced Mary to his family.
I never thought it would happen.
Each one does what he wishes.
I am free from care.
Don't tell anyone we've done this.
Why would you do something like that?
There is an urgent need for experienced pilots.
I can't do this by myself.
This is exactly what I expected from you.
I'd like to stand.
I saw Tom kissing another girl.
I didn't see anybody.
I'm sitting down.
I wish to make a complaint.
I'd like to go cycling.
I was late as usual.
You're not allowed to leave this room.
How is that question germane to what we're discussing?
She devoted herself to her children.
How tall you are!
Don't ever call me again.
Can you drive me home?
I want to know who started this.
I don't recognize over half of these names.
This is a very rare specimen.
I know this song.
You didn't complain, did you?
He will be back in ten minutes.
How many pencils do you have?
What will become of me?
My sister, wearing her favorite red coat, went out today.
Read this now.
Tom swallowed his pride.
He did not work on Sunday night.
Once you learn it, you never forget.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
It could be a trap.
Tom asked Mary to explain her answer.
Do you speak French?
I'd like to talk with you.
I'm afraid of not finishing it in time.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
Are you good at cooking?
No one ate the cake.
I need to talk to you now.
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.
She answered my letter right away.
You're a jolly good feller.
I solved the problem.
It's not important.
You did it in front of the staff.
He is a pretty great guy.
Shut up!
I want you to come with us tonight.
We all want changes.
I think this is mine.
Wait a minute.
I just wanted to thank everyone.
I've had a very busy morning.
I can do a lot of things.
Lock the door.
They are about to start.
I'm glad to hear it.
He made a journey around the world.
It was easy for me to do that.
They let me go.
I remember the day you were born very well.
Be nice.
I guess what I've said isn't all that clear, but that's the only way I can explain it.
I'm not embarrassed.
Did you win?
Tom lost his umbrella.
I really appreciate it.
He was sick of his job.
You can't blame him.
Can you read that?
What Tom said was a lie.
I'm glad to hear that.
Of course Tom didn't come.
Tom might've lied about that.
His prompt action prevented an epidemic.
Is there a train station near here?
Tom lives all alone in the woods.
No one knows his name.
The dog started barking.
Do not call him master.
Some people seem to agree with you.
I thought he was there.
Don't count on them.
You're in love.
I trust him.
She is appearing on TV tonight.
Maybe I'll call you.
Come in.
She looks better in Japanese clothes.
You stick out like a sore thumb.
That's a hard one.
I don't know how to do this.
Who cares?
I knew I'd seen it before.
Who knows what's going to happen?
I have to be in Boston in the morning.
Are you an only child?
What did you say your name was?
I was last.
I couldn't lie to you.
You're going to be a father.
This isn't the first time this has happened.
This should be more than enough.
He will always be with you.
We'll find a way to use it.
I know what those situations are like.
People say that I'm evil.
It's a double-edged sword.
They're different.
You did nothing wrong.
They go shopping.
It is true that he is young, but he is clever.
It is Monday today.
Tom is a bass player.
It looks fine.
Try to do your best.
I'd rather die than leave.
Tom is Mary's son.
I've already cleaned my room.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
He's not a boy anymore.
What do you like to do?
I'm not a soldier.
Why do you have to do it?
What's your major?
You won't feel a thing.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
You need to be careful.
I know what it's like to be different.
Tom was obviously disappointed.
I suppose you want me to help.
We'll put a stop to it.
The door won't open.
I am very poor at sports.
I wonder why he was absent.
Your face is dirty.
What makes you ask that?
He sacrificed everything for you.
Let's get out while we can.
I am ready to die.
His camera is three times as expensive as mine.
Everyone was horrified.
My TV is broken.
Do you have psychic powers?
My father cut wood with a saw.
I don't believe a word you say.
We'll die sooner or later.
I need you to fix this.
I have urgent matters to attend to.
Our office is on the northern side of the building.
She hates carrots.
I never have trouble falling asleep.
We stayed at a nice hotel.
Fluency in English is a very marketable skill today.
This is a limited time offer to new customers only.
We have a lot of time.
Tell Tom to wait.
No less than three hundred dollars was needed for the work.
I wasn't thinking clearly.
You can't go alone.
Just at that time, the bus stopped.
What other options do I have?
I arrived yesterday.
What did it feel like?
I see them.
I think we need more ice.
We were eating pizza.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Potentially, that could happen again.
I can't see him either.
You're resilient.
I can't sing.
Tom is in bed.
Do I have to do it right away?
He has a maid.
The accused was sentenced to death.
I made a lot of money.
I had the same thought.
Why are you surprised?
I think you must be mistaken.
Who is he talking to?
He gets a reasonable salary as a bank clerk.
I'm unable to do this.
This is the lady who wants to see you.
It never happened.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
I think we'll be OK.
I had to see you again.
But very soon, the battle would become fierce.
How long will it take me to walk to the station?
You should have spoken more politely.
Tom's cellphone rang.
Sometimes everything goes wrong.
There used to be an art museum in this neighborhood.
Let him do as he likes.
The tornado left a trail of destruction in its wake.
I can handle this.
Do you get it?
Come on! I can't wait any more.
Look at all these boxes.
I just can't help myself.
The accident happened at that intersection.
The boy got lost in the forest.
Can I go out to play?
I also noticed that.
I didn't realize you were serious.
They called it mass murder.
Today's dinner is fish.
My laptop is running Linux.
He came home very late.
Thanks for your help. "It was nothing."
He gave me a big hug.
Does that trouble you?
If you had not eaten so much, you would not be so sleepy now.
I can make this go away.
What should we do if it rains?
I'll eat something light.
Don't be so outraged.
Do you agree?
I can't believe you just did that.
You need to be more careful.
This chemical is extremely dangerous.
I'll ride shotgun.
It's so hot that you could cook an egg on the hood of a car.
Somebody's going to notice you.
I've got work to do here.
She advised him to stop taking that medicine, but he felt he needed to.
We knew it all along.
I appreciate your vigilance.
Help me hide this money.
We all did well.
I want to go abroad next year.
Tom wanted Mary to apologize to John.
I said I liked it.
All at once there was an explosion.
How many of us are there?
It doesn't matter which side you're on.
She was crying with pain.
I don't know how you can tolerate doing this over and over again.
I mean you no harm.
You are good.
Call me when it's done.
Didn't Tom go to Mary's house?
Get out of the classroom.
Tom wants to come to our party.
He saluted the lady.
I feel very good.
Don't forget what I just told you.
Didn't you go out?
The lid screws onto the jar.
He walked along the shore.
Tom claims he won.
He grows tomatoes in his garden.
Playing cards is fun.
A friend is someone who likes you even though he knows everything about you.
Why do you need this money?
Prices have jumped.
That's a beautiful story.
I thought so at first.
Tom said we'd find you here.
The main tap is turned off.
I thought he was honest.
You should have seen it!
He thinks that they are not sentient beings.
I would rather throw the money away than give it to him.
Give it to them.
I wish I were rich enough to buy a car like that.
You're no saint.
I beg your pardon?
She would often play tricks on me.
You're very upset.
Tom is a student, isn't he?
People live only about 70 years.
Carbon dating was performed on the sample to determine its age.
I'll drive you home.
We're running out of ideas.
You'll be all right again in a couple of days.
Tom goes jogging in the park every morning.
You freaked me out.
You get out only what you put in.
British English differs from American English in many ways.
Did I do all that?
I can't imagine what you're going through.
In the mean time, let's have a sit down.
I asked Mary to dance with me.
The choice is all up to you.
I know that you know this.
You don't give up too easily, do you?
I was never told that.
It's only a minor setback.
Don't disturb me while I'm studying.
Had he heard the news, he might have been shocked.
Be content.
He heard a noise.
She cried when she heard the story.
Air is invisible.
That's a very interesting question.
I know who killed the police inspector.
Somebody's coming.
Choose one from among these.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
I really don't want to play.
We stayed with our friends.
Tom is here for the weekend.
I can't afford a camera as good as yours.
Let's buy this one.
I did everything I was supposed to do.
The show is on Monday.
She flatters herself by thinking that she is beautiful.
The paint hasn't dried yet.
We didn't hear you come in.
It doesn't bother me if you stay.
Today, I went to the doctor's.
I've been in Boston for less than a month.
I'm going to Izu over the weekend.
I'll never forget visiting Paris last summer.
The rain came down in torrents.
I think he's making a big mistake by turning down the job.
Are you sure of your facts?
Most Japanese houses are built of wood.
I don't want any more.
Be a man.
Can I ride this horse for a while?
I was sound asleep.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
He gave me a vague answer.
I'll ask him if he's busy or not.
I'll take him with me to the hospital.
Don't do anything you might regret.
Is that for sale?
No one looks happy.
Tom's plan seemed the best.
I can't believe this is actually happening.
Reading books will make you smarter.
I just want to be your friend.
That problem is too simple.
He sat listening to the radio.
How are your parents doing?
Has Tom told Mary that he's poor?
What could it be?
Tom wasn't wearing his seat belt.
I'm already on the train.
We can't forget Tom.
Don't you want to know why?
Ask him whether they still live in Tokyo.
Why are you busy today?
Are we lost?
I just don't want to catch your cold.
I went shopping with a friend.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
Grab him.
I wish you had done what I asked you to do.
That would appear to be correct.
Don't you have any change?
Can I show you something?
You need to let me handle this.
I'm afraid not.
We're volunteering.
That dress looks really nice on you.
The food was better in prison.
He is introverted.
It's characteristic of him to behave like that.
Someone's talking.
He drowned in the river.
That's when I went to the police.
I don't think I can wait any longer.
I'll be with you in five minutes.
It's a dictionary.
I fell for it.
She is used to staying up all night.
This food is terrible.
Tom, you've grown so fast.
Do you still want to be an officer?
What time is the concert?
What'll you do back in Australia?
Next week, I'm taking the plane to Chicago.
We were disappointed with the results of the experiment.
You're either with me or you're against me.
I think you panicked.
Health is essential to happiness.
I thought it might be useful.
I can tell you're a nice guy.
She was blackmailed by him.
Can we get started with the game?
I believe we can get that done.
There's no reason not to do that.
I didn't have much time so I just skimmed through the article.
Bring along your friend.
This is the boy.
I stayed in bed one more day just to be on the safe side.
Please don't die!
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
We'll all be there together.
I met them.
You must keep this machine free from dust.
I don't understand why it happened.
There is a big stack of mail on the table.
English is a means of communication.
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I can't come with you.
I got shampoo in my eyes and it hurts.
Tom has a high opinion of Mary.
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
We have very good business.
Breakfast is served.
I am responsible for the mistake.
I want to find a good job.
Tom's eyelids were half open.
I risked everything.
I never look at this picture without thinking of those happy days.
That last round of chemo really sapped his energy.
She wouldn't let up until I agreed to go to the movies with her.
He's a man of his word.
Every time I went to his house, he was not at home.
Did you buy a new car?
That can't be true.
I always keep my word.
He loves taking trips.
The old couple sat side by side.
You'll feel at home.
The sand was warm.
You're too suspicious about everything.
Our fence is made of iron.
Please fill out these forms.
It's a misunderstanding.
Did you do that on purpose?
Don't you like Chinese food?
She decided not to attend the meeting.
Tom will buy a new car next weekend.
That's what I want most in the world.
I knew you could do it, Tom.
He has done many things for poor people.
We can't trust what she says.
Don't leave me alone.
I do anything I feel like.
Don't just stand there, say something.
We lost our electricity because of the storm.
Which meat dishes do you propose?
She didn't give me her name.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
How does this concern you?
Did you go out?
Learn these names by heart.
That's not what you said before.
I can speak neither French nor English.
Your hat's on backwards.
No one made you do anything.
That's a fair assumption.
What does this remind you of?
We have to consider the possibility that Tom was involved in the robbery.
I'd never dream of it.
Please don't tell anyone else.
You don't have to lie.
Tom ran out of the room.
I want to be alone for a while.
I got a new stereo at that store.
I went to school.
If it doesn't rain soon, our garden is going to dry up.
Where are the forks?
You can't be sure of that.
We still have some work to do.
When you skateboard, it puts quite a strain on your knees.
Don't sound so surprised. You know I can do whatever I want to do.
Do you want to know where you made your mistake?
I don't know what happened.
What if something goes wrong?
They are investing a lot.
Can you see it?
Tell me something that I don't know.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
I'm not a drug addict.
You can spend the night at our place.
I'm sure Tom doesn't do that anymore.
Traveling is easy these days.
He lost his new watch.
Some people have a terror of mice.
Why did you leave Australia?
The captain gave the order to abandon the ship.
We're not all teachers.
I have no idea to what extent I can trust them.
Are you about done?
They'll be ready for that.
She is a fox.
I'm gradually getting better at guessing people's ages.
The majority of his income goes to pay his rent.
I hope that's good enough.
Don't throw that away.
Language is the means by which people communicate with others.
It's all in a day's work.
He's not a liar.
I want to know what it is.
The rooms are deserted.
You can trust all of us.
A bad habit is easily acquired.
You start.
Don't make me answer that question.
What's the emergency?
Why is autumn called "fall" in America?
I don't think he's playing with a full deck.
Wait until you see this.
You do nothing else but eat.
Is that seat available?
A pound is a unit of weight.
Do you want anything?
People tend to raise their voices when they get excited.
People have to obey the rules.
This isn't a party.
Please pass me the pepper.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
At this point, I don't need money.
I'm afraid it may rain tomorrow.
Take one of these.
There's not enough time.
Turn on the ignition.
She got married in her teens.
I'll take a stab at it.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
I did warn you.
She loves singing.
Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish.
I'd like to attend the party.
What museums would you like to visit?
How did you get those?
Tom is hiding.
We're all here.
He admitted that it was true.
Do you want to watch this program?
I just wanted to let you know I have a date.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I was moved to tears by the story.
That was a valuable experience.
I wish I could go to the party with you.
Do what you want.
Tom can't do the job.
Let's begin with this problem.
I lost my key.
Let's go out on the balcony.
Some people think that I'm nuts.
I bought a shirt yesterday.
I have a horse.
Don't do anything you don't want to do.
You're doing an excellent job.
It was too nice a day to stay inside.
They made him work from morning till night.
Do you know anyone who can speak French?
I'll tell you what I know.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you and your boyfriend had broken up?
I'm not dumb.
Tom and Mary got into their car.
Please show me your stamp album.
You should do that.
I don't feel like going out this morning.
I'll give you all the money you want.
We cut away all the grass and weeds around the church.
Do you remember the day when we met first?
I think Tom does a fantastic job.
I'm rational.
You need to stay awake.
That's not the best example.
One good friend is better than ten relatives.
Didn't you know that?
I thought I was going to die.
You have to make up the time you have lost.
Who says it isn't fixed?
It's too little, too late.
Did you double-check these figures?
I just want you to be involved.
The game starts at two tomorrow afternoon.
Who'll be the first to die?
I read this book when I was in high school.
Prices have dropped recently.
Some people read books to kill time.
What's your best price?
What time do you leave home in the morning?
I won't come back again.
How many sisters do you have?
The problem is you're not patient enough.
I will side with you just this once.
I'm letting you go.
I didn't expect to see you at a place like this.
I'd like to believe that.
I hope that you have a good lawyer.
The basket was empty.
I've always liked your hair that way.
He snuck out to meet up with a girl.
She didn't know what to do.
I was born the same day as my dog.
That's a good excuse.
I'll leave it up to you.
I'll play along.
Someone's coming.
I hear a phone ringing.
Where's the doctor?
I think it's a dumb theory.
You're very intelligent.
Desperate needs lead to desperate deeds.
Is that thing yours?
I'm not used to the heat.
I think I've fallen in love with you.
I'm pretty sure Tom's reliable.
They were naive.
I'm a terrible dancer.
I didn't have chains for my car, so I stayed home.
I'll give him a pen.
Autumn is the best season for going on hikes.
Are you still at home?
I don't know the reason why he was absent.
I heard shots being fired.
Shut up!
I just don't think I can do it.
You can't quit now.
I had a similar experience.
I like living here.
I don't know how I know.
That box is heavy.
What is the exchange rate?
I knew this day was coming.
I guess you know I've missed you.
I can't protect you.
War affects us all.
Tom doesn't like pizza.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
You deserve more.
He cut him short by saying no.
We need to go.
They have no natural predators.
The results are by no means satisfactory.
He acted like he owned the place.
I want to retire.
They've lost so much.
We are busy men.
Her husband smokes like a chimney.
Chances are the bill will be rejected.
We're going to get in trouble for that.
We'll die if we stay here.
Now I'm done for.
I love seeing you so happy.
Tom can drive a car.
Tom doesn't like Mary. However, she doesn't particularly care whether he likes her or not.
The man who I thought was my friend deceived me.
Tom prefers whole-grain cereals.
I thought it was a secret.
Unless you hurry, you will be late for school.
All we can do is wait.
Tom committed suicide by hanging himself.
I feel like someone is watching me.
I don't know if we're going to be able to make it to Boston for Christmas.
Do you own a gun?
I no longer want that.
I didn't know Tom had agreed to do that.
Do you have a blog?
I don't know anyone by that name.
Can I sit with you?
Please spend a few minutes thinking about this.
The talisman he's wearing is supposed to ward off evil spirits.
They accused me of being a liar.
Who won the Super Bowl?
I forgive you.
Do you want me to call the police?
It may rain around noon.
Tom saw Mary stealing money from the cash register.
That guy's got a big mouth.
Sing a song with me.
Everyone was hungry.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
I want to quit.
There is no grass on the moon.
Has Tom become crazy?
A full moon is shining bright in the sky.
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
Do you want help with that?
It could cost you your head.
He was surprised by what he learned.
I arrived at the station ten minutes late.
We had a bad day.
What would you like to eat?
He is a promising young man.
We're faced with many difficulties.
What's this street called?
Don't read my journal.
She goes to market every day to buy things.
I have once been to Europe.
I'll get the car.
I'm glad you invited me to your party.
My favorite TV show's been canceled.
She disapproved of my trip to Vienna.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
Keep away from the fire.
I gazed at the sea for hours.
Who was the woman you were talking to?
We don't know much about Tom.
They lost no time in getting the sick man to a hospital.
This plant grew little by little.
I have no idea what that guy is thinking.
Tom speaks too fast.
Come back here.
Do you know why this date is important?
What time do you go to bed?
Do you know who is looking at that picture?
The moon is full tonight.
May I put it here?
Would you mind if I changed seats now?
I'm not a good liar.
How do you write your last name?
It wasn't an accident.
The bath is ready.
She invited me to her home.
This is the end of the world as we know it.
I did the job in three days.
He is off duty today.
You're too skinny.
What did you do with that?
I just couldn't let that happen.
The police are looking into it.
Do you love me?
I am bound to him by a close friendship.
It took courage to do what Tom did.
Life is often compared to a journey.
She taught him everything she knew.
I still don't speak French very well.
I'll do what must be done.
Did you just hit Tom?
They did the right thing.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'd like to help you get what you need.
I recorded our conversation.
You look like a little girl in that dress.
Tom is the fastest runner on our team.
My toe began to bleed.
Most employees expect a pay raise once a year.
I'm going to have to ask you to put your phone away.
I waited a month.
I have three brothers.
We don't want to take the time now.
He gave me a big hug.
It's the best.
I can assure you that honesty pays in the long run.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
Where should we hide?
I hope you enjoyed it.
How much does she need?
I visit Boston every summer.
He showed me how to use this camera.
They received a box of books.
What do you expect to happen?
I appreciate all you've done.
She accepted his gift.
There wasn't much else we could do.
Why do you need a doctor?
There was another one.
The young should respect the old.
The consequence of a wrong translation can sometimes be catastrophic.
Are these your children?
What a beautiful sunset!
She shot him.
This clock gains two minutes a day.
I don't understand why you don't want to go to Boston with us.
He had fun with it.
I'm just looking forward to going home.
Give him a break!
Would you do that?
I'll leave it up to you.
Why wouldn't you let me go to Tom's party?
No one is sure how many people died.
Tom stole all of Mary's money.
I like you very much.
It's nice of you to give me a lift.
What Tom told Mary wasn't true.
Who does this suitcase belong to?
This is going to be fabulous.
The problem disappeared as if by magic.
You're doing it wrong!
How did you get in here?
Be more precise.
What are you doing today?
I thought that was obvious.
What's in these boxes?
I take full responsibility for the action.
Tom said he wanted to talk.
You have to do it again.
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
I have three tickets.
I'm going to need your help on this.
This is unsafe.
I showed him who's boss.
I wanted your opinion.
I want to know how you know that.
No students could answer the question.
I did that voluntarily.
Some go to school by bicycle, others go by bus.
He sometimes drops in on me.
Both policemen were killed.
He forgot her name.
Why is this happening?
My wife is cooking right now.
I'm asking you to tell me how you feel.
Tom has no idea where we are.
The car stalled because you didn't step on the clutch.
I wanted to make sure you were all right.
It wasn't just luck.
Right now I can't think of anything else.
I'm halfway through this crime novel.
She scolded him.
The radio will not work.
Tom, are you a dog person or a cat person?
If you don't study harder, you'll definitely fail.
You're still single, aren't you?
Do you plan to rent a car?
The protesters set many cars on fire.
It should only take a couple more minutes.
They're thirty dollars each.
That's just awful.
Mom! Stop! You're embarrassing me.
Pick a number.
The cloth was dyed bright red.
Did she mention the results of the exam?
In addition to English, he speaks German.
I'll take you to Tom.
He is a psychic.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
He judged it wiser to remain silent.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
He's a computer nerd.
You're still mad, aren't you?
Tom is taking care of the kids.
You're first.
Be quiet while I am speaking.
You must respect senior citizens.
He pretended to be ignorant.
Please answer in French.
When am I supposed to do that?
If you go by bus, you can get there in about one-third of the time.
Tom fell asleep on the couch.
Do you have a bank account?
Tom still loves you.
The drug must go through clinical trials before being approved.
I spent two hours yesterday trying to fix that broken radio.
Their feet are dirty.
He was the only one who came to the party.
Did anyone see you there?
He might change his mind.
I won't be needing this.
Tom asked me how many guitars I own.
I'm just following orders.
Do I look like I'm joking?
Miniskirts have gone out of fashion.
I just thought you were happy.
Take your coat off and make yourself at home.
You have a guest.
Tom has asked me to lend him some money.
She bolted the doors and windows.
Tom went to Australia.
I met Tom on my way to school.
She pinched him.
You know we don't need to do that.
Tom began living by himself at the age of sixteen.
I can show you the pictures.
What happened was horrible.
It's for my personal use.
She brought him to our place to meet my parents.
Tom doesn't like living here.
I want to be an artist.
How did you get the idea?
The chances are that he is still in bed.
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore.
Don't move, or I'll shoot you.
I don't like watching TV.
When was the last time you went to an art gallery?
I didn't say you were here.
If you want to go, then go.
I'm glad you brought this up.
I just can't keep my eyes open.
I want to see your boss.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
Where have you put all the spoons?
I've been told that I behaved badly.
You are lying.
Just then I heard footsteps in the stairwell.
Don't you ever speak to me like that again.
She is no less charming than her older sister.
She explained her reasons to us.
Do you know what the real problem is?
Stick out your tongue.
May I ask you some more questions?
I'll stay home tomorrow.
We aren't related.
This part of town is mainly residential.
Why did you buy such an expensive dictionary?
We should be on our way.
How long has he been dead?
I think Tom will like this game.
I thought we were all going to die.
Tom betrayed his best friend.
I would like to have this car repaired as soon as possible.
Be sure to drop in on us if you come our way.
He is like a father to me.
How did you know my name?
He's hiding in the closet.
Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
Don't you drag me into this.
That story is too incredible to be true.
They are very kind.
Staying at home is boring.
Why do you laugh so hard at his jokes? They're not even funny.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Get outside right now.
He was ready to face his fate.
Are you falling in love with me?
When does he study? "He studies before dinner."
It was OK.
I want you to take a good look around.
Life isn't all roses and sunshine.
I've read your book. It was very interesting.
We saw her when leaving the house.
I realized I needed help.
You've been following me, haven't you?
It took them some time to get used to each other.
She accused me of being a liar.
Why do you spend so much time watching TV?
How many sandwiches are there left?
You don't impress me.
Are you Chinese?
Are you hungry, too?
According to the paper, it will snow tomorrow.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
I think Tom and Mary will be able to buy ice skates their sizes at the sports store near the art museum.
I'll be back.
Tom couldn't borrow as much money as he needed.
Somebody saw you.
Never choose a vocation just because it looks profitable.
What were you two talking about? "Nothing."
The fire started in Tom's room.
Don't tell your father you want to become a clown.
Wires transmit electricity.
He is just an amateur.
I'm always happy.
They'll go shopping.
You are a student.
I've got to do something first.
I'd appreciate an answer as soon as possible.
I feel like I'm making progress.
Has she ever fallen in love?
No sooner had she opened the door than a cat ran out.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Let's go as soon as it stops raining.
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone?
Bring it back when you are through.
I've already done the hard part.
You and I are a lot alike.
I can't keep up with you.
I want to stay in my quarters.
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
We shouldn't have left Tom alone in the garage.
According to the Bible, God made the world in six days.
We need heroes.
I don't want to be involved in this affair.
Your watch gains time.
Tell me that was a joke!
I'll pay anything.
My parents were proud of me.
How do we upload photos to your website?
You shouldn't talk back like that.
Solve the problem.
Tom screwed in the light bulb.
I put on my favorite dress for the party.
Have you had lunch?
I didn't know you could speak French.
I don't really sing like that.
I didn't want you to get involved.
I need some alone time.
I don't doubt that.
There was a cottage on the side of the hill.
Vandalism is on the rise.
Tom says he plans on staying in Australia.
How do you want to handle it?
I need to travel.
How did you come to know about her?
Why do you not believe in God?
I don't like to fail.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
How much money do you want?
She is wearing a nice watch.
Tom doesn't like my family.
We can't hold the enemy off much longer.
Is this yours?
My daughter is the apple of my eye.
I believed that.
I was a bit disappointed.
Remember it.
I had to go back home.
What's everyone staring at?
I am worried about my mother's health.
Clean your room.
She did a good job.
Pass the ball quickly to a person behind you.
You don't need to say anything.
I love to watch baseball and football.
When do you mean to start?
What was wrong with them?
Would you like to join us for dinner?
The meat is really tender.
He's feeling much better.
That's how I like things.
You don't have to yell.
We sat on the grass.
He's not very strict about this.
Why don't you all just shut up?
We saw smoke in the distance.
This figure is supposed to represent Marilyn Monroe, but I don't think it does her justice.
Tom sent the flowers.
What's your theory on what happened?
I took him out for a walk.
Do you remember your grandfather?
Badgers dig deep holes.
Tom should've won the race.
She'll try it once more.
You're the woman I love.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
He can pull strings for you.
I can't read French.
They slept in the same bed.
Are you staying for dinner?
My colleague doctored the report.
He looked pretty tired.
It is a song.
After he heard the news, Tom was in seventh heaven.
I can't think of any other way of getting him to accept our proposal.
He drives me crazy.
I would advise you strongly to do what the boss asked you to do.
Hang on!
Please take good care of yourself.
What is the next stop?
Would you happen to know what this is?
In that case, you are right.
I won't shut up.
I just don't know what to say.
This hat is too small. Please show me another one.
You look smart.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
Security will be tightened.
What would I do if they really came?
Help me with my tie.
His new novel is worth reading.
He is what we call a pioneer.
She didn't even try to help.
You need a holiday.
It's surprising that you haven't heard anything about her wedding.
I don't see a problem with this.
Tom should've eaten more.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
Are you crying?
I'm a trainee.
I ate a hamburger at McDonald's.
Can we recycle this?
I'm not at all hungry.
Can't you ever be punctual? I have been waiting here for one hour.
Don't make me say it.
Is your left leg still hurting?
Let's ask Tom why he was late.
Be a good boy.
Don't buy me presents anymore.
Which eye is hurting you?
Don't you see what you've become?
It's no use complaining.
I wanted to help, but there was nothing I could do.
Tom loves children.
Let's work together on this.
I want to have a word with Tom.
I figured it out by myself.
He is a very irritating critic of others.
What causes that?
They sat in a circle.
It can be dangerous.
I just want you all to know you can depend on me.
He asked about you.
The price is three hundred dollars.
I am in trouble.
I can be assertive if necessary.
I've never seen you like this.
He's always changing his mind.
I wasn't paying attention.
We need to finish what we started.
Please tell me what happened.
The boys built a raft.
They are running in the park.
He's your son.
She has the big room entirely to herself.
If you get bit by a rabid dog, you'll need a tetanus shot.
He goes to bed early but it takes him a long time to get to sleep.
I've been looking all over for you.
Please don't leave valuable things here.
He speaks Arabic.
She can sing better than anybody else in her class.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
You've got a big mouth.
What's happening in the cave? I'm curious. "I have no idea."
What a bunch of idiots!
They didn't offer me anything to drink.
How do you say "love" in French?
I was quite nervous.
I slept the rest of the day.
I'll leave Tokyo for Osaka tonight.
These windows look to the south.
Do you know Tom's wife's name?
I like to grow flowers.
Something may have happened to him.
History is more complex than you think.
We've got a mystery to solve.
Can you jump that high?
I downloaded it.
No one's talking.
Are you joking?
The cat burglar must have entered the mansion from the roof.
It's kind of late.
Tom looks excited.
I put some milk in my coffee.
We have two dogs. One is black and the other is white.
They weren't able to agree on anything.
Don't you think it's weird?
It was flat.
The children are creating a painting.
You're not wanted here.
Tom says he can make a decent living as a sidewalk musician.
Tom shared a prison cell with John.
Did you hear about yesterday's fire?
A sprain like this should heal within a week or so.
They had different ideas.
Would you mind coming earlier next time?
They want to know what your plan is.
Nobody loves war.
Are you lost?
Is this some kind of scam?
I frequently recall my happy childhood.
She has a strong dislike of insects.
I can't wait to eat it.
These are fresh.
It's doubtful if we'll finish in time for Christmas.
I think you might be overreacting.
Can we talk in private?
Where did you go?
It's the same here.
Have a good time.
I was afraid of that.
I don't know where to go or what to do.
We want Tom to know he can come home.
You won't need it.
It'll take two hours to get there by bus.
This is an important night.
Why hasn't anyone said anything?
Have you tried the chicken?
Tom likes the ocean.
Whatever you do, don't let go of the rope.
Are they still in bed?
Maybe it's destiny.
Ladies and gentlemen, please come this way.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
The coffeepot is boiling.
Are you sure everything's OK?
The sky was full of stars.
The cat crossed the street.
The speaker is young.
What do you want to do in the future?
I think you should lose some weight.
Father bought me the latest model motorcycle.
What's going on tonight?
Have they spotted you?
They questioned him.
I was born in October.
What are your weekend plans?
When does the rainy season in Japan begin?
My findings suggest that that isn't the case.
Driving through that snowstorm was a nightmare.
That should last three weeks.
These events transpired while the senator was still in office.
The police detained several suspects for questioning.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
This is a good show.
Could you please repeat it slowly?
I work at a bank.
I prefer the black one.
Don't make me hurt you.
Take the garbage out.
I don't believe that.
I feel relaxed with you.
Who's going to pay for this?
I'm not going to do that until Monday.
Words express thoughts.
I know Tom is a carpenter.
You can't handle the truth.
My father bought me a bicycle.
Have you seen a little girl with short black hair?
I've already told Tom what to do.
Everybody's having a good time.
I didn't recognize your voice.
The natives of the North-West Pacific Coast of America were probably descendants of tribes from Asia.
We may not win tomorrow.
It was easy for me to do that.
You heard your mother.
It was not always this way.
Don't let this information leak out.
The day was exhausting.
Can I say it aloud?
Do your homework right away.
He hit the center of the target with his first shot.
He rejected our offer.
Throw them overboard.
Please turn in your homework by tomorrow.
Do you know how to use this machine?
You were incompetent.
He got the ball.
Tom didn't help me.
I'd say you're jealous.
I have a computer.
I know that you still love me.
We stayed at the Hilton Hotel.
You don't want this, do you?
In my opinion, a well-designed website shouldn't require horizontal scrolling.
This blue sweater is very pretty.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Were you fat when you were in high school?
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
I know you'll make the right decision.
Tom's wife remarried after his death.
He would sooner die than get up early every morning.
You're disgusting.
I dropped my earring.
Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything.
Let's stop at the next gas station.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
It is often said that nothing is more precious than time.
Is he still here?
Could you stay and help me?
Did you do all this?
He's broke.
Tom knows that I'm Canadian.
You've given me good advice.
He's sleeping off last night's bender.
Tom is a dancing teacher.
It's necessary for you to go.
We have to give them something.
I'm not a singer.
His office is on the other side of the street.
Won't you have some cake?
His head ached.
She tried to comfort him, but he kept crying.
I felt a sudden pain in my side.
She lit the candles.
That's what makes this so difficult.
They have been married for four years.
Tom realized he had been unreasonable.
Don't talk to me like that.
Are you satisfied with my explanation?
I blame Tom for what happened to all of us.
The door will lock automatically when you go out.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
The cat arched its back.
I have a girlfriend.
Tom is bilingual.
Keep driving.
I can't remember her address no matter how much I try.
I'm sure they'll win.
There's no food.
We must've blown a fuse.
That's his.
Why did Tom lie?
Drive on.
Everybody's a suspect.
Quit behaving like a kid.
It isn't safe for us to remain in this area.
He left without saying goodbye.
Do you have any idea what happened?
Tom stood still for a moment.
I don't believe that Santa Claus is imaginary.
I have to warn him.
He adopted the orphan.
She advised him that he should stay at home.
It won't take much longer.
She altered her old clothes to make them look more fashionable.
Are you coming to the party?
Everybody except me knew what was going on.
The desk is made of wood.
I asked you to be quiet.
How is your dad?
Can I talk to you in private for a second?
I saw Tom kill the neighbor's cat.
Please let me pick up your sister at the station.
I'm fine.
You don't want to see this, do you?
She is a runner.
Don't put the cart before the horse.
You're irresistible.
She agreed with my idea.
She likes jazz, and so do I.
What does this have to do with me?
This room heats easily.
I'm glad you're here.
Tom didn't see you.
It won't make any difference.
I was forced to go.
I feel strange.
How many hours a day do you spend in your office?
They are both working at the pet store.
I really need to talk to you privately.
I can't thank you enough for all your kindness.
That's completely beside the point.
I don't remember exactly.
You always say the same thing.
He did nothing but lie in bed all day.
We could've done better.
How can I get in touch with you?
It hurts here.
Next person, please.
Every girl's crazy about a sharp-dressed man.
He looks like a clever boy.
I will choose one of them.
I did that without asking for anyone's advice.
Tom did a pretty good job.
I have more than enough.
In a few days, the baby will be able to walk.
Can you lend me some money?
Tom cried all morning.
I'm so stupid.
Do you know your size?
She was too short to see over the fence.
I think this is yours.
Do you need anything else?
We'll succeed.
Don't laugh at me.
My explanation may sound strange.
I don't like the way he speaks to me.
You're overreacting.
Tom is perfect for you.
I don't know, nor do I care.
What should I do to find a suitable job for myself?
You tried.
It's almost midnight here.
They can raise your rent.
You can't force me to do anything I don't want to do.
I know you're not scared.
They are very big apples.
I hope you are all well.
Don't work too hard!
I wrote a lot in my diary yesterday.
You will need a bodyguard.
You look terrific.
That's not really important right now.
She stared at him with frightened eyes.
You're not being rational.
Singapore has one big problem.
There appears to have been a mistake.
That's normal.
Nobody lives in this house.
Don't tell me what I already know.
Look at this.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
I located the town on the map.
According to legend, ghosts would appear in that forest, so people would not set foot there.
I'm shocked.
Why do you want a horse?
I'm so tired of keeping secrets.
I can't believe I used to watch this show.
Everybody knows that Tom likes Mary.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Yesterday, I bought a red car.
I had a little help from a friend.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Come and see me.
Is that real blood?
It's too dark to play outside.
She taught him the tricks of the trade.
Why does catnip drive cats nuts?
I'll come and see you later.
I need to talk to you about this.
Don't let your feelings show.
The animal struggled to get out of the cage.
How do you feel now?
She explained to him why she didn't like his parents.
Do you hear me?
I want to serve my country.
Have you gone mad?
Are you telling me the truth?
I knew you were going to ask that.
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
I'm not particularly worried.
I know I probably won't win.
I just had a talk with your lawyer.
I'm ambidextrous.
They were tired of waiting.
He got on the train.
Where are the others?
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
I'm horrible with kids.
Tom is a grown man.
That should do it.
Did you sign?
He read the book yesterday.
Can you pass me the potatoes?
Give that back to me, please.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you are happy.
You're the teacher.
We have to crack down on illegal trading.
That was kind of rude.
I think we may have met somewhere before.
Tom doesn't want to live in Boston.
She bought this pen at that store.
It'll take some time to shovel all the snow off the roof.
Your daughter's on drugs.
I want you to lay back and relax.
I'm going to do you a favor.
Here comes the bus.
You aren't ready for this.
Did I hurt your feelings?
You aren't in a hurry, are you?
I hid it under the mattress.
You have a very nice family.
You can go there.
He felt perfectly content.
It was a fine sunny day.
What do you have hidden behind your back?
She is late.
You're a traitor.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Don't get so carried away.
You didn't scare me off.
My best friend stole my boyfriend.
I've completely recovered.
The knife is dull.
I'll send it to you.
You must obey the traffic rules.
Tom always asks me the same question.
She cannot have done such a thing.
The attempt ended in failure.
You can't eat here.
Aren't you too young to smoke?
This is a little bit strange.
Tom shut the kitchen door.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I don't feel like eating at all.
Tom knows that Mary can't speak French.
Do it by yourself.
I was very tired, but I was nevertheless unable to sleep.
There are six people including him.
Everyone wanted to talk to Tom.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
I think you need a vacation.
Stop trying to cheer me up.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
Can you still remember the time we first met?
He thought it was hilarious.
I will stay home tomorrow.
A shiver ran down my spine.
They teach Chinese at that school.
I'm going to be your teacher.
I want to write a book.
Tom was going to do that for Mary.
Tell us a little about yourself.
Tom treats me like an adult.
Let me tell you all something.
Don't scribble here.
I don't want to raise false hopes.
A house is not a home.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
Tom was in trouble financially.
You may park here.
I just want to make sure this isn't poison.
Everyone was stunned.
She saved her baby's life at the risk of losing her own.
We were just friends.
I saw her a week ago today.
How much is this ball?
We'll protect you.
Facebook is blocked in China.
I'm not going to close the door.
I know other people like Tom.
You're very talented.
What exactly are you implying?
This medicine will do you good!
That will cost you a lot of money.
You need to be careful.
She might have been beautiful when she was young.
Are you motivated?
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.
I'm a very shy person.
Let's try something a little simpler.
There was only one small problem.
I am fond of Australian food.
I cannot entertain such a request.
I don't want to go bowling.
Tom isn't his real name.
I'm not going to tell you her name.
Do you speak English?
I wish you hadn't found me.
He traveled by boat.
I'd like a word with Tom.
The enemy attacked the town.
You have a secret admirer.
The car was stuck in the mud.
I just thought that you wouldn't want to go.
I'll let you get back to work.
Air the futon.
My camera is different from yours.
I don't think anyone thinks you're crazy.
I peeled the potatoes.
We all have choices.
I should've listened to what my mother said.
Tom bought Mary a car.
I love this job.
She saw him eating a sandwich.
I can't go with you.
We've got a lot of work to do.
I told you not to do that.
Short skirts have already gone out of fashion.
Tom doesn't know who to ask.
I can write very fast.
I thought we'd worry about that later.
Who's watching?
Tom remembers you.
I guess you know I've missed you.
I've never had a friend like you before.
Peel the potatoes and the carrots.
Did you try restarting the computer?
Do your homework.
I don't understand a thing you're saying.
The taxi picked up two passengers.
I prefer this version.
The cat caught the mouse.
She majored in history.
Where exactly do you live?
You must do it yourself.
Tom couldn't find the words to express how he was feeling.
I won't touch a thing.
They meet once a week.
What time is your appointment?
Where are your parents?
I saw Tom a few minutes ago and he looked tired.
The night is hot.
You can still change your mind.
You'd be the one to know.
The English Channel separates England and France.
Tom backed out at the last moment.
It was very sensible of him to reject the bribe.
I don't speak Chinese.
They admired the lovely scenery.
I'll be right back.
Traffic is a major urban problem.
The dog pursued a rabbit into the forest.
I can't do two things at once.
It's six degrees below zero.
I think it's worth the risk.
My muscles ached from playing tennis too much.
She went shopping with him last Monday.
We must go now.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
Nature is full of mystery.
No charges have been filed against the suspect.
I found the key I was looking for.
You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
Tom is looking for his glasses.
This is the reason why he did it.
She offered her seat to an old woman.
Get me some water.
She said that she was ill.
The doctor is taking care of Tom.
Beat it, kids!
Tom was talkative.
I took this picture.
What are the alternatives?
Nobody cares who you are.
Tom attempted to swim across the river.
I want to go to Mars.
Why did you come here?
I couldn't sleep last night.
I thought you were at work.
Give him a hug.
I'm too busy.
We want you to be the team captain.
Millions of people across the world are mourning the death of Nelson Mandela.
Is there hot water?
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
Do you want something to eat?
I'm a little short this week.
Can you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?
Who are you to judge?
When was the last time you hunted?
Things got out of control.
I see what you mean.
Watch us.
I quit smoking.
We have no alternatives.
I hid myself behind the door.
My mother is preparing dinner.
The man lit a cigarette with a lighter.
Since it was raining, we stayed at home.
Tom wondered whether it would be hard to find a job in Boston.
You're not staying here, are you?
I'm sorry, I don't buy it.
I will never forgive him.
Watch out for thieves around here.
That doesn't belong to me.
His attempt to escape was successful.
Didn't I ask you not to dance with Tom?
You should know better than that.
They fought the measures in the courts.
There was nothing I could do about it.
I just want to say I love you.
Do you speak French?
The explosion frightened the villagers.
The bridge is closed.
They wanted to oust the communist government of Fidel Castro.
Tom says he eats more when he's sad.
Please wait outside of the house.
Tom is a part-time plumber.
We're not desperate yet.
Can you stay for a bit?
Can you tell me a little about yourself?
I've got a toothache.
Don't toy with me, Tom.
Let's see what Tom left us.
Give me the diamonds.
The fireman could not extinguish the flames.
Do you have enough energy?
I have forgotten.
I really like your music.
You said you were going to handle it.
It's well done.
They didn't pay attention.
There's no doubt.
Stop doing that.
Is anybody listening?
He was exiled from his own country.
How did you come up with that answer?
I apologize to all of you.
Please stop talking.
I have no time to write to her.
The boy could not find his way out of the maze.
I have to talk to you alone.
I'm not making it up.
Something very weird happened to me yesterday.
Do you want to play with Tom?
Be sure to bring rain gear.
Even though there were many cookies on the dish, I only ate three.
He got his arm broken while he was playing soccer.
It's brand new.
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't been helping me.
It's snowing in Boston.
I don't really want to be all by myself.
I care a good deal about what you think.
Don't raise your voice.
Get on your knees.
Tom said he didn't really know what to buy.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd just done what I told you.
On my way home from school yesterday, I was caught in a shower.
This tea smells nice.
It'll be tricky.
We've already chosen.
The French president is to visit Japan next month.
I haven't had the honor of meeting him.
What makes this one special?
It is never too late to learn.
No autopsy was performed.
We tried to cheer him up.
That's what's supposed to happen.
Watch out for that man.
The bus will come soon.
Have you chosen a topic?
I met her on my way to school.
He kicked the ball.
Have you found any good solution?
I think both of them are right.
I often play tennis after school.
Tom is getting ready to go.
How nice of you!
We're alone.
Nanako is really cute, isn't she?
Get out of my sight.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
Is lunch included in this price?
Tom was thirty.
Could you give me the name and phone number of a doctor?
Are you going to leave tomorrow?
We have to be prepared for anything.
I'll call Tom and apologize.
The decision hasn't yet been made.
For many, it was a dream come true.
I won't do that unless you want me to.
I can't work with Tom.
We were pretty noisy.
Tom stole the money.
You've got a pretty good memory.
Nobody knows it's my birthday today.
You're very religious, aren't you?
How tall you are!
She is all skin and bone.
She's sitting on the bench.
Do you always help Tom with his homework?
I can't do this job without you.
He wrote a book on porcelain.
Tom is a religious man.
You must think I'm a complete idiot.
It was a big help for me.
Tom doesn't know who I am.
I heard a noise in the bedroom.
Remember these rules.
They adopted the orphan.
That's a mistake.
You really are nuts.
How many books can I take out at one time?
It's starting to snow.
I wanted to talk about it.
Tom lives in a tiny house.
How much will it cost to get to the airport?
Your answer is far from satisfactory.
Turn right at the next intersection.
That's what I have to do.
I'll get you out of this horrible situation.
What's there to say?
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
A woman was kind enough to show me the way.
I just figured out how to do it.
I'm not on anybody's side.
If you help me, I'll try it again.
He is always looking for praise.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
I think you're drunk.
It's a proven fact.
Tom looked at Mary and blushed.
Tom was impatient to see Mary again.
What if they don't like me?
It's a good question.
I've been looking foward to meeting you.
Are you falling in love with me?
That's what interests me.
Why are they fighting?
Prices will certainly go up.
Are you sure you can do this?
Did Tom buy it?
That's a risk we have to take.
Where exactly are we going?
No one is there.
She can hardly speak.
She has plenty of work to do.
Where do the airport buses leave from?
He certainly is smart.
Your wife is here.
Did you see it?
This offer is available for five days.
I used to love swimming.
It wasn't that cold.
Tom never gave in to temptation.
All his hopes evaporated when he lost his only son in the war.
We can't really keep all this stuff, can we?
I just got tenure.
They made equally tough demands.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
Can I help you?
I don't have travel insurance.
The teacher recommended that I read Shakespeare.
My strength is all gone.
The bridge was washed away by the flood.
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
I don't like my job.
What's the next stop?
My friend Tom has twice as many stamps as I do.
They never found out the truth.
He is fatter than when I last saw him.
I immediately built a fire.
Doing that would be a waste of time.
Your mother and father are dead.
Please give me a piece of bread.
I hid behind a tree.
The tree bent in the wind.
I remember.
We didn't get paid this week.
Don't blame it on her.
How's your cold?
The examinations are all over.
We don't know what they want to use it for.
I don't think he is fit for the job.
Maybe Tom should've stayed with the children.
That house is for sale.
Furniture made of good materials sells well.
That's very disappointing.
I've had enough.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
It's cold today!
Tom isn't able to come today.
I hope I haven't offended anyone.
I think that Tom and only Tom can do it. However, some people think that Mary could do it, too.
I'll look after your child while you are away.
I was planning to call him, but changed my mind and didn't.
Beware of imitations.
The food was not fit for man or beast.
I actually never knew that.
Your wife left.
I'm starting to get used to the dark.
They constructed a bridge.
Did you get her letter?
I know this will work.
This is the office in which he works.
What a nice car you have! You must have paid a lot for it.
Let me buy you a new one.
Don't talk about my family.
Are you sure about that?
You knew I wouldn't do that.
Health is more important than wealth.
That copy differs from the original.
You smell wonderful.
He's a very talented man.
How are you feeling this morning?
Do you want to try it?
I brought you some water.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
Let's leave early.
As soon as they have collected the necessary funds, they can restart their project.
The doctor says she suffers from rheumatism.
I'm not sure I understand.
I don't think it's a good idea.
He was absolved of all responsibility.
Do you have a moment?
There's nowhere for you to hide.
He is proud of being a musician.
I want it all.
Stop acting like you care.
How far is it from here to the museum?
Tom is one of Mary's childhood friends.
I was deeply impressed by his speech.
I tried to warn you.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
Tom is gambling again.
I'm glad you invited me to your party.
I couldn't hear what was being said.
Tom has a lot of toys.
Something like this wouldn't happen in Australia.
That might be a little difficult.
I had a quick breakfast.
Where are you now?
Is she young? "Yes, she is."
I did have fun.
If you don't mind, may we inspect your suitcase?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
She can't swim.
That's what I'd want.
Are you all right now?
The cat crept toward the bird.
Tom won't starve to death.
It was a tedious job.
You need to stop complaining all the time about things that can't be changed.
Well done!
They made fun of my clothes.
I must help her at any cost.
Mary and Alice are sisters.
You're opportunistic.
Not everyone was convinced.
I really wish you hadn't done that.
Work slowly.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee and topped off his own.
I have made many mistakes in my lifetime.
Several thousand people became victims of this disease.
You have to wait in line.
We are all eager to see the movie.
I don't want you two talking about me.
Tom was out till midnight last night.
Can you swim across the river?
Go to the store.
You're so cute together.
I had to get out of there.
The native people were forced off their land.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
He likes sports as well as music.
Get out of my way.
Tom will be happy to see you again.
You're very stylish.
You can't do both at the same time.
Tom reads the New York Times.
I wish you all good luck.
He did what he had to do.
I'm no different.
They should be fine.
Children grow up so quickly.
She came back soon after five o'clock.
Tom said that he'd be late.
I can't understand anything Tom is saying.
The party ended at ten o'clock.
This will only take a second.
This ticket is good for three days.
Would you like me to do something about it?
You must pay attention to his advice.
They have explosives.
People who break their promises can't be trusted.
I saw a white bird on my way home.
I like it very much.
Help me move this stone.
Tom usually drinks coffee without sugar.
The mayor denied having taken a bribe.
Tom doesn't know how strong you are.
Tom got the part.
Why don't you look for a job?
I suppose you have the right to know.
Come and see me whenever you are free.
I'll be in my office.
I have fewer books than you.
My mother loves me.
I had no idea what to expect.
Do you like football?
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
The baby is in his crib, sucking on his pacifier.
They want to do this right.
Everybody knows me.
He can run faster than I can.
Tom is whistling.
We will take care of this for you.
She got home at seven.
Maybe I wasn't supposed to do that.
We're dedicated.
Are you the one who wrote this?
There are plenty of nice girls out there.
The kid has a keen sense of hearing.
I am afraid of what the teacher will say.
At any rate, he was satisfied with the results.
Why didn't you come to the party?
I prefer soccer to baseball.
I can swim well.
Tie your shoe.
They made the right choice.
He kept his sense of humor until the day he died.
It rained heavily.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
This is how to cook rice.
I'm ambitious.
What's your favorite movie?
I have already done my homework.
School begins at eight-thirty.
She's as good a cook as her mother.
Tom has already fallen asleep.
It is kind of you to give me a ride.
Don't lose heart now.
He's a control freak.
I'm fine.
True friendship is priceless.
When did it begin to rain?
Don't try to do too much.
Rear end collisions often cause whiplash.
Everything has to be perfect.
They accomplished their mission.
Is it possible to get on the next flight?
Don't you go away.
Are you enthusiastic?
We can all walk home.
I just need a little more time.
I am fond of playing the guitar.
I'm too tired to help.
Where should I put my baggage?
I bought this for my boyfriend.
Can I have a coffee?
Is that supposed to be a question?
Your name, please.
This wall is cold.
You're not the only one that was hurt.
Do you want to sit down?
Hurry up and get dressed.
I could kiss you.
Any song sung in French puts me in a sexy mood.
I'm very happy.
They let me go.
What happens tomorrow?
I helped you when you needed help.
Tom doesn't want to die.
How did he know my name?
Anybody and everybody wants to go abroad.
He was a good friend.
Have you already forgotten everything?
I won't give them to you.
It's unlikely to be true.
She left her ticket at home.
He's crazy about her.
I tried to do my best.
It'll go away.
It could've been a lot worse.
Tom is hiding something from us.
What made you come here?
I have asked him.
Are you leaving now?
I am in agreement with most of what he says.
Can you tell me where it is?
I think you should do it yourself.
Don't you want to sit in the front, Tom?
You're really awesome.
They don't know yet.
Do you feel like going swimming?
They all did it.
I want you to come to my wedding.
How much time does the average teenager watch TV every day?
I'd like to improve my French.
What'd I do?
This is a dead-end alley.
What can you see?
He requested help.
You are such a liar!
He just loves to bully people.
They're all fake.
I paid 2,000 yen for this atlas.
Thank you for your time.
He told me that he would wait till I returned.
Tom didn't sign the agreement.
Tom was delirious.
I wish he were here now.
Come back in a day.
I want to see them.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Do not throw anything out of the window.
I think I've found enough for everybody.
Take a look at this map.
Let's go ahead and eat.
Why did you side with him instead of me?
I'm much older than you are.
I am not used to being spoken to in that rude way.
Why did you lie to me?
I think there's only a slim chance of that happening.
The cat ate the mouse.
They're back where they want to be.
How can you say that?
No two snowflakes are exactly alike.
It's a gorgeous day.
This pond has a lot of carp.
I went swimming in the sea.
He broke out into rage.
What can you do?
I'm going to go to the doctor this afternoon.
He secretly showed me her picture.
He dozed off in history class.
He took credit for my idea.
He's a food critic.
Who is the person in charge?
You'd better go. It's getting late.
He made a little statue out of soft clay.
We live near a big library.
I need a pair of scissors to cut this paper.
They say he's very rich.
I'm sure of it.
You're restless.
Have you been waited on?
A dog suddenly jumped at me.
Tom's drowning.
Don't push your child into any vocation he dislikes.
That house is famous.
Why is everyone laughing?
I don't know what that word means.
I can't believe you actually said that.
Let's find Tom a nice office.
Get it out of the house.
Did you get a good look at his face?
Clothes make the man.
You've been injured before, haven't you?
We had a narrow escape.
That wasn't my question.
I have been loved.
Let Tom sleep.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
He reached the rank of general.
You're lucky that you have a job.
This doesn't feel right.
Tom doesn't hate you, Mary.
What's the precise meaning of that word?
Did he show you the picture?
I think life is what you make it.
They are very big.
She was ready to face her fate.
We all laughed.
You play the guitar very well.
We're positive that they forgot to call us.
That's a good idea. I'm going to do that.
Does it snow a lot here in the winter?
That's a promise.
It was stormy the day before yesterday.
Judge for yourself.
The score is 9 to 2 in favor of our school.
It may or may not be true.
You can come with us.
India gained independence from Britain in 1947.
You're resourceful.
They stayed up all night.
I was a bit emotional.
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.
State your case briefly.
Tom is in the other truck.
The investigation is ongoing.
You've got a cute friend.
Please remember what he said.
It's about time.
Tom wanted Mary to stay with him forever.
She stood there even after the train was out of sight.
That's not fair and you know it.
I have finally reached my limit.
She decided to drink water instead of soft drinks in order to lose weight.
I'm sick of hospitals.
He is a dramatist.
I think you mentioned that last week.
Might makes right.
We have to address that problem.
Do you really want to know?
I will go on ahead.
She did it carefully.
You knew I was married.
You're very angry.
I had a small dinner party last weekend.
Tom told the police everything he knew.
I'll get used to it sooner or later.
I'm not used to being spoken to that way.
I saw Tom going into the cave.
Traveling is a lot of fun.
I'm mistaken.
Are you sure that you know what to do?
I don't want you to lie to me.
I wasn't punished.
Not everything that you read on the Internet is true.
Is it my turn?
Will you go on foot or by bus?
Am I the only one who agrees with you?
I think you ought to rest a while.
You know I'm older than you are.
He began to look for a job.
Why are you so tired?
Let me find out.
It's a serious illness.
Everything was very good.
I don't think that's the point.
Try not to worry.
I'm on speaking terms with Tom.
She bought an album for me.
Who is your favorite actor?
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
They used truth serum.
They're all watching us.
Do you think she's pretty?
I would love to come with you all, but I don't have any money.
You ought to ask for your teacher's permission.
I suppose you are right.
Tom didn't break any rules.
I didn't realize you were serious.
If anyone were to talk to me like that, I would call a police.
I'm not invited to parties.
Shut off the water.
I can't stay long. I have plans.
Is it all right to take pictures in this building?
It cost him ten dollars to get the ticket.
Can you take us with you?
That was obvious.
Thank you for considering me for the job.
What a beautiful city!
I don't think anybody can help me now.
Has Tom cleaned the room yet?
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
Put this on my tab, please.
Summer holiday begins in July.
She loves cake.
The planes flew over the village.
According to the X-ray, everything is all right.
I've had a busy morning.
Dentists take x-rays to examine your teeth.
What's wrong with them?
Tom can't have done it by himself.
I swear it's the last time.
I'd like to hear what your opinion is.
Maybe you should call the police.
I can't say I share your enthusiasm for the idea.
Hold on a minute, please.
I'm just happy to be here.
My uncle has completely recovered from his illness.
What language do you usually use when talking with Tom?
You need a keycard to open the door.
We're brothers.
He ordered me to sweep the room.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
Nothing seemed to work.
My TV set is almost 15 years old, but it still has a good picture.
She gave me a fake phone number.
He dedicated his life to peace.
Do you mean to tell me you can't find one?
He paid no attention to my advice.
How's your morning been?
I don't know how to do that.
Tell me all the details.
Am I right?
Don't close the door.
Please forward this to as many people as possible.
Look at that house.
I have a migraine.
Shake hands with him.
It's not too far.
That comes in handy.
He was busy with his homework.
He does not live there any more.
Stop being so nice to me.
Answer me.
He is busy.
You have my word on that.
Everyone's still asleep.
You get out only what you put in.
He uses honey instead of sugar.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
Does Tom plan to help us?
Something is wrong with our electric heater.
He came by bus.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
My father doesn't like soccer.
Tom is tall, but not as tall as me.
Tom's wife left him.
He was knocked unconscious.
I'm not wearing this.
Did you telephone him?
I'm not really that surprised.
This is a map.
I won't go with you unless you tell me where we're going.
The movie was disappointing.
He likes baseball very much.
His hobby is painting.
You are not allowed to turn left on this street.
Everyone likes them.
How do you like them apples?
What's the date today?
How long did you stay in Canada?
We're going to get married this summer.
Tom never reached Australia.
You could've been hurt.
Tom helped you, didn't he?
I thought you didn't want to talk about this stuff.
Look up there.
Did I leave my umbrella here?
You don't know why Tom didn't come yesterday, do you?
That can't be good for you.
It's really humid, isn't it?
Could you leave us alone?
Tom laughed.
Can anyone here speak French?
Didn't you hear me calling?
Tom currently lives with his uncle.
Would you all relax?
I didn't mean any of that.
Tom doesn't blame you for anything.
Next year, I'll return to Boston.
Tom took out the garbage.
I've decided to leave on Monday.
I'm not worried about Tom.
They have had no rain in Africa for more than a month.
I felt exactly the same way.
I warned you once.
Would you mind coming earlier next time?
They're downstairs.
You never asked why.
If he should arrive late, you may start the conference without him.
What else do you have?
I'll stand.
Paper napkins are sold in packs of ten.
Everybody needs to calm down.
The store is closed Mondays.
Have you ever tried to think about nothing?
I'm not available.
There wasn't enough.
I just heard another explosion.
Do you have something you want to say to me?
How about eating out this evening for a change?
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Don't tell me to go home.
She has the large house to herself.
Everyone was killed.
Might I express my opinion?
My father has bought a new car.
Do you really think that?
They followed you here.
You make me so happy.
I'm surprised Tom never mentioned you.
You did this.
She called him every bad name she knew.
I need more money.
Walking is a healthy form of exercise.
What a thought!
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
I walked 10 kilometers today.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I work on a farm.
He described exactly what happened.
They have a problem.
The exhibition is already open.
She had a crush on him.
You know I'm older than you are.
The whale is the largest animal on the earth.
Let me help you with that.
Circumstances have changed.
I'll take that.
You shouldn't study all day long. You should go out and have some fun.
The door was unlocked.
I'll never see him again.
He doesn't live there anymore.
You can't do this to us.
Does that seem fair to you?
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
I really feel like a beer.
Can you believe this is really happening?
I'm not at all satisfied with her.
Tom and Mary are looking for you.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he didn't know the answer.
Did I give you that impression?
What's wrong with the way I'm dressed?
It looks like it's going to rain.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
You're really gifted.
Astronomy deals with the stars and planets.
Tom can't speak French well.
He won't make it.
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
Black looks good on you.
I don't know how to contact you.
This work doesn't pay.
He's not going to visit you tomorrow.
But why is it all so secret?
What year were you born?
What are you here for?
Tom has done his homework.
Are you all set to leave?
I sleep with two quilts in the winter.
I'll prove it to you.
Tom got out of the bathtub and dried himself off.
I think you already have enough money to buy what you need.
He is in Tokyo.
As soon as we get the tickets, we'll send them to you.
From now on, I'm going to be here for you.
I didn't deserve to go to prison.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
I never should've left you.
Look up the new words in your dictionary.
I don't feel like studying English today.
I avoid crossing the street here if I am in a hurry.
Can I get my phone back?
Did Tom look like he was happy?
Do you want some pepper?
As far as I know, he isn't lazy.
Why don't you put some clothes on?
Feel free to ask any questions.
Do you want to do it right now?
Why are you angry? "I'm not angry!"
You have to give me more time.
I can draw you a picture of that if you want me to.
Christmas is soon.
What with good fortune, and his own effort, he won the first prize in the contest.
You must've thought I was an idiot.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can I have a word with you?
She devoted her life to education.
No matter how hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
You may open the window.
I no longer live here.
I was with Tom from 8:30 to 2:30.
The job applicant did not meet the expectations of the employer.
The weather couldn't have been better.
Tom is someone I really look up to.
I can't repair the computer.
I don't eat as much meat as I used to.
Don't forget to remind me of that.
Can you come?
I don't know how to cook.
This is messed up.
May I bother you for a moment?
We should call the doctor.
Did you have a nice evening?
Her red dress made her stand out.
I just don't want you to get upset.
You are a teacher.
I need to take your temperature.
How did I do?
Everyone was drinking.
I am afraid they can't get along very well.
You've got to be making this up.
That old book is a real find.
I've been waiting a long time.
I got up at six-thirty this morning.
That was why he entered the university.
I heard him speak fluent English.
He drew some vertical lines on the paper.
You don't know everything.
Death is similar to sleep.
I felt embarrassed at first.
How did you all get here?
Was it all a dream?
What a nice surprise!
I'm sorry, Tom, I can't do that.
I don't have the time to help you right now.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
We did that yesterday.
This bed is too hard to sleep on.
Have you gone mad?
Turn down the volume, please.
X marks the spot.
It was so hot that I thought I was going to pass out.
A ball hit her right leg.
Anything you could do in support of their effort would be very much appreciated.
Are we expecting any other guests?
I didn't think we'd need it.
Tom didn't take many pictures on his trip.
Is everything all right up there?
How many times a day do you eat?
This bread is really delicious. Where did you buy it?
I don't know which of you came first.
I checked twice to make certain we hadn't made any mistakes.
I was very flattered.
I'm planning to move to Boston.

I want this fixed as soon as possible.
They know us.
I know something you don't.
May I visit you tomorrow?
Put the baby to sleep.
This is not for you.
Where should I put my bags?
Tell Tom to stay where he is.
Can we move on to the next item?
I'm a little tired.
They aren't the kind of people you should want to be friends with.
You're the only person I know that owns a gun.
I need to stop.
What do you say to a game of chess?
I like seeing you this way.
If you follow my advice, you will have no trouble.
We're studying French and web design.
I'm meditating.
Tom's mom is cool.
Poor eyesight is a handicap to a sportsman.
The man was a total stranger.
She asked me what had become of him.
They can't start without me.
Did you close the window?
This is the house where I was born.
I'm pretty uncomfortable right now.
I made him carry the briefcase.
Reading books will make you smarter.
Don't read that kind of book.
I'm sorry that you've been badly injured.
Tom got there long after we did.
I called the police.
The old man died from hunger.
He wiped the sweat from his brow.
The curtain fell.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
She idolized him.
I need to unlock this door.
You're careless.
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
I fell in love.
If I can do it, so can you.
I have a thesis to write.
Can I go to bed now?
Not only did he teach school, but he wrote novels.
Are these your daughters?
I learned a lot from you.
Tears are a child's weapon.
I just haven't gotten to it yet.
Wait just a second.
Now leave us.
Let's start with the easiest question.
Anything you say may be used against you.
He was punished for his crimes.
All is well.
It was not until recently that she changed her mind.
Do you know how to use it?
He told me that he wanted to leave the company.
I've been meditating on what you said last week.
Don't be fresh with me.
Please stand face to face.
That's easy.
You won't bleed to death.
He ate all of it.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
Put this list in alphabetical order.
Air pollution prevents some plants from growing well.
Where do we need to go?

Have you ever been fat?
How would you describe yourself?
Honesty is the primary reason for his success.
I might stay.
Don't try this at home.
Do you want me to go home?
I fell asleep listening to music.
I don't need to talk to him.
It's normal for you to feel a bit woozy.
This hat is a little too small for me.
We have a warrant to search your property.
Don't try to make me angry.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
That's not what I signed up for.
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
He gave in to the temptation.
Are they all strong?
You're still mad, aren't you?
It was because of the storm that the trains were halted.
This is where my dad works.
They're stalling.
Are those your books? "No, they aren't."
I am not certain about that.
It was all there.
There's always a first time for everything.
What will it take to get you to vote for me?
I'd like you to do your best.

Excuse me, could I get past?
Her son will succeed for sure.
The fire started in Tom's room.
When did you start studying Latin?

Why are you all here?
My family are all well.
He seems to be worried about something.

That store sells meat and fish.
Tom turned on the light.
I was worried to death.
Tom has lived in Boston for more than a year.
I did that on Monday.
Loosen the screws and remove the lamp cover.
Do you understand what I am saying?
I wonder who that girl is.

She scolded him for being late.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
Do you see me?
My cat is hiding under the stove.
He's here to spy on us.
Why do I get the feeling you don't like Tom very much?
We haven't seen you in a while.
The teacher and I sat face to face.
We should wait a little.
I'll make a reservation.
I want you to do something about it right away.
She is kind.
Why do you want me to wait in here?
We are two of a kind.
You're just a little homesick.
You're not like me.

Don't you understand what's going on here?
Timing is everything.
Kids are cruel.
I am a volunteer.
Does anyone want some more pie?
I want you to have my land after I die.
Let's just keep this between us.
What type of car do you have?
That's all I have to say to you.
Tom talked with Mary yesterday.
Can you describe the object?
Anyone can ask a question.
He got very mad.
Tom's the one who broke the window.

To prevent the disease from spreading quickly was not an easy task.
What's your schedule like today?

It's no secret.
Tom will tell me everything eventually.

She was kind enough to lend me large sum of money.
No one knows what to do.
I was lonely.
They know the truth.
Are you sure about this?
Let me have your attention.
Wait a second.
I want you to go to Boston.
We know so little about Tom.
He is a fast speaker.
She is skipping rope.
You won't believe it.
I need more time.
You will have to study harder next year.
You're not allowed in there.
I managed to repair my car by myself.
No matter what you say, I won't give up.
Tom is shorter than all of his friends.
I was going to do it anyway.
Can you put up with the way he behaves?
You lied to us, didn't you?
I think you deserve more than this.
Where can the kids play?
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
I am an American.
I don't want to listen to you.
Continue doing what you've been doing.

My birthday falls on Friday this year.

The only time he feeds the dog is when his wife is away on a trip.

Do you know what this is called?
He made up his mind to go there.
I've never come across such a strange case.
God sent a sign.
I owe you my life.
It's at the back of the building.
That's not what it means.
They live near the beach.
Are you a high school student?
I'll take that into consideration.
That's totally awesome.
She was overcome with happiness.
Tom got divorced last summer.
We exchanged greetings.
You've tried.
I don't think anybody's going to help you.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
Maybe he won't become famous.
That wasn't what Tom meant.
Tom has a lot of responsibilities.
You're my princess.
Does anyone in your office speak French?
I like grapes, but I can't eat so many.
I almost stepped on a skunk last night.
They agreed to work together on the project.
I quit my job.
Have you called the boss already?
Strictly speaking, his answer is not correct.
Try to learn a little English.
He's afraid of that dog.
I'm very hungry.
The cows are eating grass.
When did you tell me that?
He told me the story of his life.
Tom left in his car.
I'm on death row.
I'm still trying to solve this problem.
That was never an option.
He has a large basket full of flowers.
The bridge is under construction.
It appears that he will win first prize.
We need rules.
Parents are responsible for the safety of their children.
Pack your gear.
I've already drunk half a bottle of wine while I was waiting for you.
We need a little more time.
I'm counting on it.
We've chosen a hotel near the museums.
I'm not your husband anymore.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
Are you mentally ill?
He went for the doctor.
That's better, isn't it?
There is a lot of furniture in this room.
I'm lucky.

I can keep a secret.
Who told you all that?
I'm not breaking the law.
Tom looks very busy.
Is that all you want?
The buses left one after another.
I gained three pounds.
Ten is ten percent of one hundred.
You're very sophisticated.
This pen has run dry.
You could get arrested for that.
I know that you still love me.
We're dedicated.
I never worried about Tom.
He took care of the children while his wife was shopping.
Act like a man.
I thought I recognized you.
Stay in your car.
He can't read French, much less write it.
That was the worst movie I've ever seen.
She believes whatever he says.
No matter what game he plays, he always wins.
I don't want to live by your rules.
I'll attend the meeting.
I caught sight of her in the crowd.
Did I tell you that?
Tom says he's seen a ghost.
He acted in his own interest.
Do you know who that person is?
Almost all the doors were closed.
Tell me if you're in good shape.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
It's impolite to point.
You owe me an apology.
I have a slight fever today.
Please shut the door.
He did not know where to go.
What time does your class end?
There were no more free seats.
Do you think I want to do this?
Water is to fish what air is to man.
That wall is cold.
Do you know where your children are?
I just don't understand.
Why do you want all this?
What is the capital of Haiti?
I don't think you can sell that.
It looks like a UFO.
What's your job?
Hold this.
Can you account for all the money you spent?
I have looked for it up and down.
They basked in the sun.
He did his best never to think of her.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
I accept, but only under one condition.
I don't like it when people ask me to do things for them.
Tom plays tennis very well.
Aren't you annoyed by that?
I know it's a lot of money.
I don't hate you, Tom.
I grew up eating Japanese food.
I baked it for you.
Tom said you were meeting him for lunch.
He used a big piece of paper to make the bag.
I wrote my name on the paper.
I don't think Tom will be afraid.
I will not do it again.
It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
I often hear her play the piano.
It was his first trip as a captain.
Tom kept on talking even though Mary had fallen asleep.
I don't want to talk to you about this.
Give me a glass of water, please.
Do you have a points card?
Tom'll come.
I broke the law.
I'm done with you.
Sometimes when it's very cold, I can't get my car to start.
What's this all about?
We want to reach a wider audience.
Are things going well?
Can you make it go any faster?
I must go out.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
Just about everyone came.
Have another cup of coffee.
You sure ruffled her feathers with that anti-feminist joke.
Tom has a fast internet connection.
Is this your pen?
You don't need to explain that.
You should quit smoking.
Can I take a look at it?
He has too many books.
You're too stupid to live.
He sat in front of me.
How do you relax after work?
I'll check in.
Where is the bus terminal?
Be a man.
I haven't talked to anyone but Tom today.
Let us never speak of it again.
Who do you think you are?
The wall is two meters thick.
He was standing there with a vacant look.
Do you love your country?
Tom drinks milk every morning.
Are you sure you just want water?
That's not completely accurate.
I thought you might be upset.
I'm not sure I like this.
They're here for me.
I'm training for the triathlon.
He didn't keep his word.
I didn't expect you.
Choose three books at random.
Give me what you have in your hand.
I couldn't let you take all the blame.
I promised Tom I'd not tell anyone.
Where's that movie showing?
Tom is working on your car.
About how much money do you need?
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
I just assumed that you wouldn't mind.
Someday my dream will come true.
I don't care for him.
He has an intriguing personality.
I don't know who needs to do that.
I hear you were grounded.
I went to my bedroom and cried.
Please be honest.
I was in the right place at the right time.
You're forgiven.
Let's open the box and see what's inside.
My father will be back at the beginning of next month.
This is my last offer.
I called Tom's house, but no one answered.
Tom asked me what I wanted to eat.
I hope to have my car paid off by next September.
You may use my new car.
She risked her life to save him.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
Don't leave the water running.
This happened to us, too.
Do you have any food allergies?
I thought you were older than me.
This house is uninhabitable.
I think you should quit.
What did you see in the kitchen?
They went whale watching.
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
Where's your house?
I'd like you to take a look at this.
When I speak Japanese, I sound like a child.
I will show you around the city.
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Tell me about your daily life.
It wasn't so hard to do that.
I heard that Tom doesn't speak French.
Is there someone with you?
You can swim, but I can't swim.
They showed me a lot of nice pictures.
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again.
Have you made up your mind to become a teacher?
Now, it's my turn to laugh.
My cousin, who is a lawyer, is in France at present.
You've often said so yourself.
We've got to conserve water.
I have an extremely tight schedule for tomorrow.
I need to know why you're here.
You're very wise.
What are you doing here?
Tom calls Mary every night.
He's the only one who survived.
She was a beauty in her day.
Her mother always accompanies her.
Please don't die!
He was never to see his native land again.
Do you play in a band?
We are worried about you.
She made fun of her husband.
Tom is proud of his son.
The actual price was lower than I had thought.
How much time do you actually spend thinking about the future?
Everyone, follow me.
She'd just begun to read the book when someone knocked on the door.
Would you care to bet?
Tom is now in a new school.
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.
What you're doing is illegal.
I gave some of my old clothes to the Salvation Army.
I didn't want to surprise you.
I'm a Japanese teacher.
These books are my books.
I don't have all the facts.
You won't find it in there.
I heard a knock at the door.
I think that would be nice.
Before you can love others, you need to be able to love yourself.
How long is the Nile River?
We wish you a pleasant journey.
I knew how to keep a secret.
I'm not used to these things.
My hands are dirty. I have been repairing my bicycle.
I had a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Who was that man waiting outside?
What are you going to do tonight?
This is not my specialty.
The stated price does not include labor charges.
When they finally found him, it was too late.
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
How much did you get out of the deal?
The price of gold fluctuates daily.
I hear you were grounded.
You're selfish.
We don't need these things.
Don't feed the animals.
I'd like to go inside.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Do you know how to speak English?
They can't fire you.
He is regretful that he couldn't go.
I'll do that for Tom.
What is the good of doing it?
Have you learned the poem by heart?
How is the weather there?
They agreed to start early.
How long does it take to get to Vienna on foot?
Tom tiptoed past his parents' bedroom.
Why did you buy the flowers?
This door's locked.
I know I can go faster.
It was like a dream.
I just wanted to ask you a question.
You speak so softly that I cannot quite hear what you say.
Keep driving.
They are now either in Kyoto or in Osaka.
We worried a lot about you.
Is it time to leave?
When did you get back from Boston?
If it were not for water, there would be no life on the earth.
Tom told them not to do that.
Tom is someone who can't be trusted.
We have to obey the rules.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
Are your parents home?
That's very good.
Don't get on the train yet.
Everyone wins.
You are too sensitive to criticism.
I'd like some chocolate cake.
You can't handle this alone.
I'm not going to argue with you.
I am a cat person.
Tom's weak.
It can be very cold here even in May.
I've had a tough year.
We want to know who's the best.
I remember asking an old man the way.
Catch the ball.
I think you're cute.
How much time do you actually spend thinking about the future?
Her composition was free from mistakes.
Why is everybody shouting?
I can't afford to buy a car.
I am no longer young, but I can still bite.
No one knew what to do.
Darwin changed everything.
I thought you knew this area.
Stop crying like a girl.
I think he's attracted to you.
I know Tom is claustrophobic.
He looked up at the sky.
Do I have to write a letter?
They made up an unlikely story.
Who was the girl you were with the other day?
This is kind of expensive.
I'd never do what Tom did.
You should check your blood pressure.
She was too tired to work.
Incidentally, this room doesn't have anything like an air conditioner. All it has is a hand-held paper fan.
One thing you should know about me is that I'm obsessed with punctuality.
Is his story true? "I'm afraid not."
Don't be a chicken.
Tom doesn't like basketball.
She went to Italy to study music.
He knows what's going on.
I forgot.
Do you really like that?
Give me the microphone.
I need a week.
We organized a farewell party for her.
Get out of my seat.
It isn't as cold here as in Alaska.
We're all to blame for that.
Do I have to undress?
I only told you, no one else.
You passed the test.
I think they're ready.
He denied having written to me.
You forgot to close the windows before you left the office last Friday.
It is too dark to play outside.
He nodded to me as he passed.
Have you gone mad?
You're thirty thousand dollars in debt.
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
I think the KGB was implicated.
The proof is trivial.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
Don't expose it to the rain.
Tom is left-handed, but he writes with his right hand.
You may choose any of them.
She advised him to see the dentist, but he said he didn't have enough time to do so.
I'm looking for a bag for my wife.
This doesn't seem normal to me.
This will be on the test.
His house is across from mine.
I lied to you the other night.
Luck comes to those who look for it.
You should face up to the reality.
I don't like any of these paintings.
My father is always forgetting things.
Sleep is essential to health.
We'll keep in touch.
Are you still upset about what happened?
I just want to go to school.
You should have done it with us.
They're in the shower.
He anonymously donated a large sum of money to the Red Cross.
She spoke English to me just to show off.
Tom says he likes the way Mary sings.
Inoue doesn't like computers.
We'll make the right decision.
We did not help him, so he made it by himself.
Please forgive me for not having written to you earlier.
We got separated.
I hope we can avoid doing that.
They're almost here.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
Tom has only been pretending that he doesn't understand French.
I know that you're there.
You found me where no one else was looking.
I don't know much about your family.
You can't keep something that big a secret.
What time do you want me to pick you up?
We'll be back on air shortly.
I would like you to go instead of me.
I'd like to see the budget.
I thought I heard you.
It doesn't matter how small it is.
I liked your friends.
Tom said we can stay.
Both of you are wrong.
Tom couldn't stand Mary not knowing what had happened.
They all laughed at his error.
You had plenty of opportunity.
Can you swim underwater?
Why did you do all this?
Swimming is one thing I can do fairly well.
Ask me anything you like.
What do you want to see while you're here?
What did you think of the wedding?
I'm not learning anything.
He was scared to admit that he didn't know.
I recommend this.
Could I have some coffee, please?
He felt very lonely.
I interpreted her silence as a refusal.
I have to take a bus to go anywhere.
I know what to expect.
Portugal is not an exception.
Please settle this account by October 28, 1998.
It rained hard yesterday.
The speaker is young.
Did anybody see you?
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
The choice is all up to you.
What's wrong with you?
I don't think I can do this anymore.
Tom bought a refurbished phone.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
Since there was no taxi, I had to walk home.
There's no knife.
I sighed.
She swims well.
The results are significant.
I'm not paid to do that.
A lot of these are Tom's.
She gave money.
We took turns with the driving.
I want to take you to dinner.
Get out of my office.
Birds sometimes cause accidents by getting in the way of airplanes.
Is aggression natural, or is it learned?
I spilled coffee on your tablecloth.
Dig a deep hole.
I'm proud of my brother.
I'm sure that he'll come on time.
The courts will decide that.
I am loved by all my family.
Tom whispered something into Mary's ear.
Can you tell me your address?
I'd like to order a pizza.
I just love that kind of stuff.
Was this letter written by Mary?
Don't worry about making mistakes.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Tom and Mary got married last October.
I am doubtful whether he will come.
This coat fits you perfectly.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
We can do it right now.
I don't know which to choose.
Six of us are going on an excursion to the beach this weekend.
Like father, like son.
Mary wanted to marry a man with ambition.
I wish to see my father.
I feel terrible about ruining your party.
What kind of stain is that?
Where is your house?
You may invite anyone you like.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
Tom said you wanted to see me.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You're creative.
You did something incredibly stupid.
You're conceited.
The power plant supplies the remote district with electricity.
City life suits me very well.
We're not from around here.
Will it rain today?
That's really great!
It didn't hurt at all.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
The news made me happy.
I absolutely must know what you're planning to do.
Do you feel like dancing?
You can't hurt me anymore.
What is it you want me to do?
He always leaves the window open when he sleeps.
Tom gave me back my dictionary.
Would it be OK if I turned off the lights?
Who did you give the flowers to?
You should still be at school.
Tom told a joke, but nobody laughed.
Circumstances did not permit me to help you.
Finding an apartment can be difficult.
Tom brought me here.
What's that bird called?
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
Put on your pajamas and go to bed.
You have to eat before you go.
Are you going to sing here?
Do you feel like going swimming?
Tom is growing up.
You will never be too old to learn.
I can't remember how to say "Thank you" in German.
I wish you could come with us.
Do you have any idea what you've done?
Do your best!
You need to be more patient.
Are you up?
Time for dinner.
You need to study more.
I want cash.
Tom has three ex-wives.
Tom handed Mary a pamphlet.
That's what I wanted.
He is good for nothing.
It is cruel of him to say such things to her.
I thought you were older than me.
Do you feel giving gifts is important?
The way you sit tells a great deal about your nature.
I want you back.
I'm being used.
I can't even cook an omelet.
The students were all looking forward to summer vacation.
I'm not good at French.
At least they listened to me.
I agree with everything you just said.
I think that this a fake.
I've just gotten home and had dinner.
It's really stressful.
He didn't keep his promise.
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
Tom said he was looking for a place to eat.
He never fails to write to his mother every week.
They camped on the beach.
Could I say something, please?
I went to the gym.
Your work is below average.
The car crashed into the truck.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
I want to eat this.
Cats don't need collars.
I can't find Tom.
My name is Tom.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
The more we learn, the more we know.
You're a liar.
I am Finnish, but I speak also Swedish.
The only thing that matters is whether or not your teacher thinks your report is good enough.
You like him, don't you?
Is she a pretty girl?
What're you all doing in the library?
I know that you kissed Tom.
Did you buy flowers?
You have to ask me for it.
What were you thinking of?
I've got to talk to you about something.
The furniture in this office is really modern.
They are still children.
Tom has done nothing illegal.
A gentle wind is blowing.
It'll help you save energy.
Didn't anyone question you?
It's ours.
If you want me to help you, all you have to do is ask.
It's not negotiable.
I want Tom to be here for Christmas.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
I live in Australia.
I kept my mouth shut.
French is a very interesting language.
I wish my dream would come true.
I was afraid I'd be late.
They were high school sweethearts.
That's just your imagination.
I just thought you might want to talk.
I think the movie is almost over.
Rigor mortis sets in soon after death.
Let's take a 10 minute break.
I wasn't able to believe him at first.
I was hoping you could help.
For me, this is not a problem.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
She warned the children not to play on the street.
We walked as far as the park.
Show us around.
How many people were there?
I don't have time to be sick.
Tom is the star of the show.
I have plenty of friends.
I was never worried about you.
I know that you trust Tom.
I have to admit I'm curious.
I've always preferred working alone.
I'm drunk.
Come and see me once in a while.
Everyone looks uncomfortable.
Stop treating me like a child.
I'd like to sit further back.
We didn't tell you that.
There's no harm in trying.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
This one is all yours.
They won't be in time.
I thought that you could swim.
This is the calm before the storm.
I don't want your gold.
What's your favorite board game?
We were deeply moved by her story.
Should I open the windows?
You're not easy to find.
I didn't realize you were so good at French.
You can't handle this alone.
I don't like this soup.
I considered changing my job.
There is nothing worse than doing something in a half-hearted manner.
Tom decided to go home early.
Don't tell me what's possible.
Is he correct?
He knows the truth.
Tom wants to say hello.
Tom knew he was going to die.
He was alone.
Tom is vulgar.
What's your favorite subject?
I don't understand you.
Workers at the company went on a strike.
We didn't reach the summit.
Pull over here.
Did you solve the problem?
Don't play games with me.
There is a right time for everything.
I didn't want to go outside.
I had my hair cut at the barber shop yesterday.
I think we may have a problem.
I don't think I want to talk about it.
The water from this fountain is safe to drink.
You don't even know how.
I'm very glad to see you.
Do you still want to be an officer?
We're running late.
Do you want me to leave?
Tom will buy a house on Park Street.
You were jealous, weren't you?
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
I told her not to let go of the rope, but she did.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
I know how busy you've been.
He didn't get paid for it.
No matter what happens, my determination won't change.
The zipper is stuck.
Where exactly did you go?
I believe it is a genuine Picasso.
I don't want you eating between meals.
Our team is winning.
Why are you so obsessed with cars?
I went outside early in the morning.
Tom was great tonight.
My brother and I were very close.
Is it your first trip here?
He likes music a lot.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
Don't you think it's time you left?
It's because he loves me.
Not every question deserves an answer.
He ran as fast as he could.
I hate hospital food.
The coach gave me some advice.
I forgot the key to my room.
Stop arguing.
Follow us.
This is the picture that Mary painted.
The middle one is mine.
You can type, can't you?
I recommend we keep our distance.
Where's the map?
We're on the same page now.
I know I'm alone on this.
I can't see anything.
You should get up early.
Who told you the news?
I don't know how to swim.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
Tom can't afford to buy that.
I don't want a boyfriend.
Seen from a distance, this mountain looks like Mt. Fuji.
Now isn't a very good time.
You're my enemy.
Nowadays jobs are hard to come by.
Can I have something to eat?
I pretended to be asleep.
What kind of woman do you think I am?
I'm just thinking out loud.
I'll be back in a minute, he added.
I heard a voice I didn't recognize.
A friend of mine came to see me during the day.
There is no room for romance in my life.
I tried to act natural.
Isn't that what you were hoping for?
I was profoundly disturbed by this news.
To make matters worse, it began to rain.
The work was very difficult.
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee.
Let’s go now. Otherwise, we'll be late.
It wasn't me who started the fight.
You didn't give us much choice.
Nothing unexpected happened.
Do you have a boyfriend?
We need actions, not words.
You have a lot of strange ideas.
You idiot!
He lost his way in the snow.
I've only used it once.
You get used to it.
Tom is the richest man I know.
He made fun of my accent.
I feel it's something I can do.
The fire brigade was on the scene within five minutes of receiving the call.
My boss assigned the hard job to me.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
When was this car washed?
Tom looked really uncomfortable.
I don't have your strength.
It's hard to describe.
That man is a soldier.
He is watching TV.
Do you still hate French?
I was young and stupid.
He's a powerful sorcerer.
There isn't any reason to get upset.
He is qualified as an English teacher.
That has nothing to do with it.
This is not safe.
Light the candles.
You can easily judge the ripeness of a banana by the color of its peel.
I wasn't fired. I quit.
Above all, I want to be healthy.
I'm sorry, but I can't attend the meeting in person.
I'm not staying here.
We're very satisfied with it.
He became a policeman.
I wasn't allowed to leave.
Speak up!
He died of old age two years ago.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
I was careful.
I am sure of his passing the examination.
She continued with the work.
Let me give you a little tip.
Red-haired people tend to have freckles.
You're very wise.
I don't have anything to give to you.
We all know.
That's a shame.
Tom says he plans to stay in Australia.
Was it difficult to make?
It's even worse than I thought.
I'm truthful.
Your answer to the question turned out to be wrong.
It's an art more than a science.
I expected a bit more.
His play was a hit.
Will we have a hot summer?
Did you see what Tom just did?
He is taller than any other boy in his class.
You need to be prepared.
I think we're related.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
You should start as early as you can.
Shouldn't we ask Tom?
Is your wife tall?
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
I am afraid it's too late.
Why don't you give me a break?
I'm not worried about you.
Tom and Mary really loved each other.
It's important that you understand.
I can't think straight.
It's quite likely that he'll come.
I'm glad you're my friend.
Did he show you the picture?
Let's see what happens.
A loud noise jolted me awake from a deep sleep.
Don't you see the pattern?
He had lost all hope.
That's a crazy idea.
Did anyone see you come in here?
He made reference to the previous director.
Don't open this window.
Sulfur burns with a blue flame.
I enjoy the time we spend together.
What else do you need?
It would be interesting, I think.
He's working on it.
Do as you want.
They forgot to lock the door.
I'm a bit hungry.
I travel frequently.
A few days' rest will do you good.
We talked about yesterday's test.
They will get married next month.
Keep focused on your work.
What did you make?
Tom's story keeps changing.
Tom left the water running.
I have eaten a lot this week.
Those houses are 500 years old.
You don't look that good.
He wouldn't even speak to me.
I'm sure she will turn up soon.
Promise me you'll be careful.
I did it.
This is so unfair.
We sat on the grass.
Tom tells me you're his assistant.
How long have you been out of prison?
Do you like music?
There is a strike.
Do you take American Express?
This computer doesn't work.
I can't afford to buy a used car, much less a new one.
That's something I've always wanted.
Tom didn't want anything.
His dog barks at me.
He wrote about plants and trees.
In our next class, we will study the days of the week, the months, and the seasons.
Tom didn't attend class last week.
This word comes from Latin.
I have high blood pressure.
Stay right there.
I am terribly busy because the report deadline is near.
How long will you remain in Boston?
Who would like to go first?
Everything has been arranged.
I'm happy to have a job.
I'm pressing charges.
Pardon me?
Whether we win or lose, I won't have any hard feelings.
Who are you waiting for?
I'm playing the guitar now.
The ship was flying the American flag.
His cousin, whose name I forget, was a nurse.
It's just the right size.
The company provides health care and life insurance benefits for all of its employees.
I'm reading an interesting book.
I haven't finished my work.
I want to work as a volunteer to make amends for everything I've done.
Can they see us?
I don't feel like trying.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
Please don't hurt me.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
A piano is expensive.
My whole body is sore.
Be discreet.
I want you to take this with you.
I'm exhausted.
Tom reminds me of a boy I used to know.
Are you ready for the trip?
The leaves fell.
Let's get this party started!
This was a lie.
I spent the whole day in reading the novel.
Obviously he is wrong.
He was found mysteriously murdered.
The car is waxed and shining.
There is an urgent need for more people to donate their time and money.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
Do you want to sit next to the window?
Can I speak to the person in charge?
A stay of execution was ordered at the eleventh hour.
I had forgotten all about today's meeting. I'm glad you reminded me.
You are twice as strong as me.
May I have a drink?
Everything we've told you is true.
You deserve a pay raise.
I'll be with you in just one minute.
Tom was afraid to go back home.
Tom announced his resignation yesterday.
Don't bother getting up.
We made friends with them.
We won.
How could you not tell me about this?
They were in that room with me all night.
You made me late.
We have a long way left to go.
I want to teach French.
There wasn't anybody in that room.
Answer the phone, please.
I didn't see your car outside.
They lost everything.
This is beautiful.
Several students were absent from school because of colds.
What insects have you eaten?
She is French.
Now drink up.
He never tells a lie.
He had nothing to say, so he went away.
There are many people who don't like me.
After taking a bath, Tom ate dinner.
If you eat that much, you'll get fat.
Sputnik was launched on October 4, 1957.
Did you take the money?
Don't tell anybody.
Could I have the bill, please?
Lock the door!
You're the one who planted that tree.
How are you going to do that?
You're very skeptical.
He is above doing such a thing.

Let's hope she comes.

Mary is the kind of woman I like.
Why are you flinching?
Tom needs some new clothes.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I am a member of the baseball team.
I've come a long way to see you.
Tom is still not a lawyer.
They were taken prisoner.
They want you dead.
You lost an earring.
He put his things down and left.
You are really annoying.
When are you going to finish this?
Don't speak with your mouth full.
Try not to cry.
I appreciate what you are trying to do.
What do you think she is doing now?
He wrote a book about his adventures in the jungle.
The dog sleeps on the couch.
He wants to live closer to nature.
There's nothing to be done about it.
I hadn't intended to work at this company this long.
They hoped for even better days to come.
Look at the price.
Tom and I've been discussing the situation for the past three hours.
I don't deserve to be this happy.
Job security became a major worry.
I haven't done this since high school.
I like girls.
I have good news in store for you.
This road leads to Hong Kong.
What does this have to do with our current problems?
Tom said he didn't know how to swim very well.
Life is like a journey.
Does this look good on me?
I'd lock my doors if I were you.
We're very satisfied with it.
He always keeps appointments.
I want a raccoon.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
Turn left at the next corner.

Can you please write that down?
Come over.
I'm getting back together with my ex-girlfriend.
I teach Chinese.
He is thirty years old.
Tom knows where I am.
I want to go there.
That's a shame.
You can have both.
Where is the coffee shop?
I stopped smoking once and for all.
It's far-fetched.
Is Fox News biased?
I doubt if it will.
I need somebody to talk to.
We can get a beautiful view of the sea from the hill.
I bought her a clock.
I think Tom will be well prepared.
I can't wait that long.
He heard the news on the radio.
Tom held Mary in his arms.
I was very tired today.
My sister likes melons and so do I.
The more you study, the more you discover your ignorance.
Grab a seat.
Can I take your picture?
Stay in bed.
That was then and this is now.
Whose bicycle is this?
I know how to handle this.
Be calm.
I owe him some money.
You look a lot like someone I used to know.
Everything happens for a reason.
You're winning, aren't you?
No one's in sight.
Are you still married?
You handled that well.
Do you know where Tom is going?
You need to stop doing that right now.
It is necessary to have a license to drive a car.
My boyfriend is not a loser.
Have you betrayed me?
He spoke with a pipe in his mouth.
It tastes very good.
I baked it for you.
I swear to you I will never do it again.
You lied to me.
Science does not solve all the problems of life.
Would you like to go fishing next weekend?
I didn't buy that book.
It's very similar.
Don't sound so surprised. You know I can do whatever I want to do.
I've come to the same conclusion.
Ask Tom.
It was really overpriced.
Are you busy Friday night?
We're happy with our car.
Your method is different from mine.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
I couldn't stand.
I'm glad that I didn't eat the food that made you sick.
I can't be without you.
I don't want you at my party.
You speak French very well. I wish I could speak it as well as you.
Let's watch a horror movie.
He dried himself with a towel.
It doesn't get any better than this.
It has been raining since yesterday.
Don't forget your ticket.
I just signed the contract.
You know that better than I do.
She exuded nothing but confidence going into the final round.
He is better off than he used to be.
I didn't want this to happen.
It's all nonsense.
I married a Canadian.
Grab the end of this rope.
Do you have to make a speech?
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
I don't know anyone here.
This train runs between New York and Boston.
Japan is located in the Northern Hemisphere.
Tom thinks this price is reasonable.
My time is running out.
I didn't know that soccer was such a dangerous sport.
Don't touch anything without asking.
Respect your elders.
I didn't start all this.
She has a hot temper.
Would you like to hang out with us?
There's a condition.
Are you coming or not?
I had a weird dream last night.
I know the gentleman.
I know each one of you.
I really want to kiss you.
A good idea occurred to him.
Windows 95 crashed on me AGAIN!
What a bore!
He is a novelist and poet.
This sounds like a good idea.
This may hurt a bit.
What an excellent idea!
She is wearing a white dress today.
Tom and Mary are drinking.
He is the last person I would want to go skiing with.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
How about your place?
I took your name off the list.
We'll be working together.
They were free at that moment.
The guests are in the living room.
Do you find me unattractive?
I needed it yesterday.
The meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I was naive.
I feel bad for them.
We're in kind of a hurry.
Many people do not trust the government.
I will explain it to him.
No one laughed.
We're hoping to open in October.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
You should spend what little time you have left with your friends.
Everyone has to start somewhere.
Let's make a trade.
The meeting was all but over.
They did not keep their word.
I'm the youngest in the family.
Tom was my first real boyfriend.
I ate caviar.
It's not safe to text while you drive.
It's exciting.
It was one of the worst experiences of my life.
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
Everybody is sleeping.
He won the prize last week.
It should be fun.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
That requires careful consideration.
None of us want that.
Is there a supermarket nearby?
I often read the Bible at night just before I go to sleep.
What was the weather report?
Let me help you with your baggage.
We were all present at the party.
That's accurate enough.
There was nothing but sand as far as the eye could see.
It's not as bad as it seems.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Tom is a lot shorter than I am.
Tom has three children.
I did it once.
That's another matter.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I knew you'd come back for me.
It was the best night of my life.
I told Tom why I needed to do that.
Were you at home yesterday?
I don't like dogs.
To do him justice, he did his best with his limited men and supplies.
May I borrow that book from you?
This will help keep you warm.
I knew you'd like what Tom gave you.
The middle one is mine.
Why is this happening?
What a sad thing to say.
He doesn't want to see you.
I went swimming in the river.
I'm not sure that that's possible.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
He didn't say anything new.
I had to see you again.
She was asked not to speak at the meeting.
Children often cry just to attract attention.
Because his parents had died when he was young, his uncle brought him up.
What do those lights signify?
Please let me try it again.
You're very curious.
Tom is as busy as a bee.
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
Do you mind if I ask why?
Don't make this personal.
The milk is in the fridge.
I wonder if something has happened.
He jimmied the lock.
We saw a stranger enter the house.
I'm just as tired as you are.
He plays tennis every day.
What do you think I should pack for my trip?
Do you need money?
Tom tried to keep calm.
They're doing it right.
I don't like big dogs.
I just brushed my teeth.
I thought we had found the perfect hiding place, but the police found us.
That young lady is a nurse.
I got nauseous.
Be watchful.
We had fun with it.
He is my boss.
Tom asked us to sit down.
Quit wasting my time.
I enjoy a challenge.
If you eat three square meals a day, your body will have the energy it needs.
My father had me wash the car.
Be kind.
I'm glad to see you again.
I think that we should do that again.
I want my hammer back.
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV.
Who was killed?
Let's hope Tom can do that.
Whose ring is that?
Tom's homeless.
Tom asked Mary several questions.
It is extraordinarily hot today.
My hair is a mess.
Tom says he feels much better today than yesterday.
Tom is very unhappy.
There's a scratch here. Could you give me a discount?
I'm dying of thirst.
Remove the chicken's giblets before cooking.
Don't talk to the driver.
Don't you want to ask me what I want?
I won't eat that.
I have to win.
They're safe.
We can solve this.
We've all seen that before.
I've enjoyed reading this novel.
He still wants to come.
The roof of my house is red.
I apologize if I offended you.
Where is the Australian embassy?
Are these yours?
He's in a state of shock.
Tom is our family doctor.
He came just as I was leaving.
Watch closely.
It was a silly question.
Show me how to do that.
They just want to get to know you.
He was innocent of the crime.
I suppose it's my fault.
He gave her a book.
I'm ready for my next challenge.
Tom wouldn't mind eating meat and potatoes every day of the week.
She likes to read books.
Don't try to fool me.
I love you guys.
He focused on his studies.
For what purpose did he come here?
I was about to go out when the phone rang.
I've already paid you.
Take a book from the shelf.
We must always be ready.
I understood almost everything.
It was a terrible affair.
I wonder why people always want to know the truth.
I'm not so convinced.
There is not much traffic on this road.
She's about the same age as I am.
Who can help me?
Thank you very much for all you have done.
Make sure you stick together so no one gets lost.
The milk turned sour.
A lot of fish perished.
Fortunately, Tom is a different person now.
While reading a book, I fell asleep.
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
I'm not signing anything.
There's no exit.
Let me give you a lift as far as the station.
How long has it been since you played with a yo-yo?
How can you do this to me?
His behavior puzzled me.
He abandoned his family.
Why are you interested?
My wife just had a baby.
I've never stopped loving you.
Tom swam to the shore.
It's complex.
It was careless of you to forget your homework.
I'd really like to know why he did that sort of thing.
I saw a horse pulling a cart.
We managed to get there on time.
I can't believe I'm here again.
I'm glad we saw Tom.
Am I disturbing something?
Who are you talking about?
I've ruined everything.
I figured I might find you here.
I appreciate what you did today.
The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates.
You always want to control everything.
He doesn't understand you.
We're all crazy.
My wife is always finding fault with me.
I like you just the way you are.
I explained the procedure to him.
I had a problem with my car on the way to work.
I know that he can draw.
Doesn't it interest you a little?
Where's your family, Tom?
Can you do it faster?
What is going on?
We gave up trying.
The house is made of stone.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
Overfishing is a major problem.
Can one person really make a difference?
I checked the list.
Tom smiled halfheartedly.
I don't know about the others, but as for me, I'm for it.
The teacher pointed to the blackboard.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
I'm not all that busy.
I take it that we are to come early.
She is mad at you.
His pictures are very famous.
He is reasonable in his demands.
There've been times when that's happened.
She parked her car in a vacant lot.
He turned a blind eye.
My father quit drinking.
You're free to leave now.
Children often ask me for money.
The children are terrified.
I love adventure.
Is it comprehensive?
Do you have other family?
You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?
I promise you I won't do it again.
I'm not joking.
Can you see that small house?
What do you think she is doing now?
They wanted to steal the car.
Who ordered that?
He zipped open his bag.
I go to church on Sunday.
Is he at home?
Going to Boston was Tom's lifelong dream.
That man is completely drunk.
You're going to die.
Do you know about that?
Why are you surprised?
How much will this cost?
Do you feel lucky?
It's his problem, not mine.
I'm constantly telling her to behave herself.
We're about the same height.
I don't like our new coach.
I want to know what's on that train.
Add a tiny pinch of salt.
There is a red rose in the vase.
They found it.
The more I listen to her, the less I like her.
The laborers formed a human barricade.
Your father won't buy it.
Do you think that'll work?
He is working in AIDS research.
Please come to my house.
You never get my jokes.
That architect builds very modern houses.
Mother insists that I should eat more vegetables.
What exactly does this button do?
I throw myself on the mercy of the court.
The decision was easy to make.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Tom ate a chicken sandwich.
I wanted Tom to drive me to school.
Tom scrubbed the bathtub.
Please tell me which bus to take to go downtown.
Tom wasn't stupid enough to tell Mary what he really thought.
We play football every Saturday.
I wasn't busy today.
I'll wait here till he comes back.
All of them died.
Everything in this store is overpriced.
What do you want to know?
Come and help us.
Tom rummaged through the drawer, looking for a pencil.
I'm sure your intentions were good.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
I've saved the best for last.
I think that I came too early.
I hope you'll both be happy together.
Do you trust her?
How long are you staying in Japan?
I will be back soon.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
You must do it quickly.
I need to go eat something.
The new furniture came today.
Why don't men hibernate?
Do you want me to leave the light on?
Have you made your decision yet?
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
The world is dangerous.
He made a thorough analysis of the problem.
Would you lend me a pencil?
You were happy.
We had a lot of rain yesterday.
Your shipment should be delivered within twenty four hours.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
I'm a freshman.
I can't hear you very well.
Where's the entrance?
A part of this land is mine.
This is a little bit strange.
I'm going to start over.
How would you translate this sentence?
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
We were supposed to meet at 2:30.
You have more energy than I do.
He turned on the radio.
They're not expensive.
There's nothing wrong with this bicycle.
I would like to chat with you by e-mail.
I don't know how to address you.
There are three of us.
She expected him to leave town.
This is irrelevant.
How long does it last?
Was there a note?
I'm trying to figure out something.
Could you say that again?
I'll be getting married in October.
I don't like the red jacket.
Tom loves Mary.
I appreciate the invitation.
We'll take your feelings into account.
Who's in control?
Lake Biwa is the largest lake in Japan.
We missed you very much at the party yesterday.
I cried on his shoulder.
I appreciate your situation.
We shouldn't stay here.
I wonder how many horses died during the Civil War.
I'll help you after work if I'm not too tired.
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
Tom is laughing.
How are you going to pay for this?
I am in the house.
I feel bad about the way things happened.
We'll try to make a good impression.
I plan to leave this here.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
Tom likes to eat ice cream.
Your secret is safe with me.
Tom loves his job.
How's Tom going to find Mary?
Tell me what Tom took with him.
I haven't written anything for months.
Be prepared.
I've done my homework.
I could hear everything the president said.
Do you know Noah's ark?
He was fascinated with her beauty.
The telephone is ringing. If you want, I'll answer it.
I want you to help me clean it up.
Nobody knows how the fire started.
We considered going, but finally decided against it.
Where's the Red Cross?
He made a wisecrack.
What do you think of the new teacher?
I know exactly where I want to go.
I'm capable of making my own decisions.
I think it's time for me to write my mother another letter.
He should have bought some pencils.
I took it for granted that you would come to my party.
Shall I draw a map for you?
You can't do this to yourself.
Don't you think it's a bad thing?
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
There are many old temples in Kyoto.
I live near the sea so I often get to go to the beach.
Don't stand too close.
I'll never come back.
Tom wants to apologize to you.
Tom has met someone.
I tried not to cry.
The area is built up now.
I wish I were wrong.
After the war, Britain had many colonies.
I'm biased.
I've been working since I was thirteen.
Maybe you’re right and I'm wrong.
It's only a painting.
The three were arrested.
He declined the offer and so did I.
You should have a doctor look at that.
He lived on crackers and water for three days.
My mother almost never complains.
Do you like mine?
Can I have a paper bag?
Of course, I don't need it.
I can't praise him enough.
Why should there be a problem?
He had been there for ten years before he came to Kyoto.

If I were you, I would stay quiet.
Our server will be offline on October 20th for scheduled maintenance.
Were you shot at?
I quit smoking.
Where did you get your hair cut?
I put my family before my career.
Tom wants me to go with him.
Who'll take care of the dog while we're gone?
His story is true.
She couldn't convince him to ask for a loan.
I had a checkup the week before last.
I like skiing very much.
I'm not yet accustomed to this cold weather.
French isn't easy for us.
Is there any sugar?
Tom lay awake for a long time thinking about what he should do.
Push the red button if something strange happens.
It's a pity that he can't marry her.
Don't you hear those sirens?
I think we're related.
I don't think Tom will give it back.
I only have one so far.
Write down your date of birth here.
You don't have to buy water, do you?
You've been following me, haven't you?
Will you please call me a taxi?
Tom told me he was unlucky.
It's only the beginning.
That's wise.
Tom must pay for what he's done.
Can you get the door to shut?
I don't think I'm unimaginative.
Could you put these in a box?
Her beauty exposed her to many dangers.
He is not honest at all.
Suppose you had ten million yen, what would you do?
It's more comfortable here inside.
I like classical music.
That's exactly it.
Thanks.
This movie is appropriate for all ages.
You're no saint.
They lied to you.
We called off the wedding.
We got up at dawn.
Open your mouth!
I'm downstairs.
I'm in training.
He is the oldest of them all.
My watch is ten minutes slow.
I wish I knew where he was!
Why don't we talk in your office?
We should make use of atomic energy.
Thanks for your help.
I want to stay with you.
This is my room.
I'll miss you.
I'll never stop.
I've got a pacemaker.
Look, here comes your train.
I'm good for now.
My neighbor's son made fun of my daughter today at school.
Does your mother know about this?
May I speak to you a minute?
I know we can do this if we try.
Take care not to awake the sleeping baby.
Tom didn't let us do that.
Didn't you hear the voice in the next room?
A curtain of mist blocked our view.
Was it all worth it?
I have your schedule here.
He writes to his parents once a month.
What've you done?
That was a problem.
I'll visit you at your office tomorrow.
Tom knows a lot of people.
Do you want to take that?
I'm in Boston.
We found a beautiful, blue lagoon on the far side of the island.
He neglected his duties.
How do you know which one is yours?
Who did you go there with?
Don't try to trick us.
Can you give me a sign?
He got what he wanted.
I like her sister very much.
It is finally all over.
Their sales are growing.
He did it with great zeal.
Aren't you the only one who has a key to this door?
I am in the habit of taking a walk every day.
I got a message that you wanted to see me.
Can you hold on a little longer?
Put another log on the fire.
Tom said that he didn't want to go to Mary's party.
Shall I check the oil?
That reminds me of my father.
He has no redeeming traits.
What do you think is going to happen?
No one can help you.
I'm sorry.
I'm the oldest.
There's nothing like a good hot bath.
The roof was damaged by the storm.
Do you know him?
The people protested against the low altitude flight training.
They made me really angry.
Tom didn't do anything else.
He is busy with his work.
Tom wasn't there yesterday.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
He came to Tokyo at the age of three.
Every girl knows that singer.
I'm a football player.
You know very well what I'm talking about.
I like Japanese girls.
She is as beautiful as ever.
The couple broke off their engagement.
He pushed the emergency button.
He's so cute.
Tom certainly doesn't seem to mind helping Mary.
He memorized that poem when he was five years old.
Not every man can be happy.
The bucket is full of water.
Tom fed the horse.
He gathered up his things and left.
Tom understood everything.
I got thirsty.
It wouldn't be the same without you.
Tom killed Mary because he found out she had started the fire that had killed his family.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
Are you having a good time?
Tom asked a question.
I want to see you two in my office. Now.
Shut the door, please.
I want that book.
Tom is probably with Mary.
Unless we find some way to drum up more business, bankruptcy will be our only option.
You're cuter than Mary.
Is anybody else in the house?
I only drink to be sociable.
That job is impossible for me to do.
Thanks again.
You're very skeptical.
This is where I draw the line.
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
One king after another succeeded to the throne during those few years.
Tom didn't want to play golf with Mary's father.
That's how we do things.
I just made it under the wire.
I know that you're smart.
Cats hate to get wet.
My father has been dead for ten years.
I've brought you a gift.
I like your painting.
I'd like to sail around the world.
It's right next door.
That's not true.
Tom didn't kiss anybody.
You must not lose sight of your main object.
Isn't there anyone you know?
Tom has no idea what that means.
You shouldn't be doing that.
I'm proud of my son.
I'd like to hear you sing.
You're early.
It's not that deep here.
Tom made himself a cup of tea.
I'll grab it.
It cost a lot more than I thought it would.
I'm sorry I said that.
We were worried.
You're the teacher.
Plants grow.
I'm not satisfied yet.
I beg you.
It isn't optional.
I can walk.
Do you know how to pronounce this word?
He solved all the problems.
The FBI secretly bugged the mobster's hangout.
He says it's urgent.
You can't lift the piano by yourself.
I'm not giving you any more money.
This game is fun.
How many songs have you written?
We heard the boy playing the violin.
Get away from there.
Tom wants to live.
The girl let the bird go.
According to the paper, there was an earthquake in Peru.
He was more than a king.
We live in the country during the summer.
This guy is a loser.
Why did you help Tom escape?
I wonder if Tom knows Mary's phone number.
You said you wanted to ask me something.
He treats me like his slave.
I'm naked.
The weather is cold all year here.
Tom, you're a genius.
Your car is fast.
Is this all yours?
Let's take the 4:10 train.
While you are reading to me, I can do my sewing.
The time women spend doing housework is now a lot less than it used to be.
What do you want now?
You're supposed to be resting.
Do you know any good places to eat around here?
I thought I heard you.
We have enough.
Did you settle the bill?
Next time I switch jobs, I need work that will let me make use of the experience I've gained up to now.
I wanted to go to China.
I know you're afraid of heights.
Did you buy it on the black market?
We're going to eat a lot tonight so I hope you're not on a diet.
Here's the best part.
I had doubts from the beginning.
We love picnics.
Tom attended Mary's funeral.
Shut your filthy mouth.
Frankly, I'm not that impressed with his idea.
The experiment seemed to be going well.
I'll help you pack.
Can you imagine what our lives would be like without electricity?
I have an exam tomorrow.
What are you crunching on?
Go warm up.
Let's speak French.
He hurt himself when he fell.
I enjoyed talking with him at the party.
I can't understand why you are so critical of him.
Don't change a thing.
We're looking forward to your being here.
Memorize it.
In autumn, leaves change color and fall.
He sat reading a book.
Why are you so clumsy?
You snooze, you lose.
He fought until the end.
Why are you all so busy?
He looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
I need time to unwind.
He is not qualified for the job.
Science has brought about many changes in our lives.
You said your boss was a nice guy.
Everything's going to be OK.
Do your best in everything.
I find her opinions odd but interesting.
People used to laugh at him behind his back.
She is singing the latest popular songs.
She is proficient in both Spanish and Italian.
I never wanted to compete with you.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
Smile at the camera, please!
I'm the boss around here.
I think we need more time.
I was afraid I wouldn't have the pleasure of meeting you.
How unlucky I am!
Tom can have anything he wants.
Tom was afraid that Mary might change her mind.
A decision had to be made.
I only did it for your own good.
It was like something out of a movie.
How do you know that it's his?
I'm very sleepy now.
He is quick to voice his concerns.
I need more room.
What do you think is down there?
Preventive measures are much more effective than the actual treatment.
I could never harm you.
Where was he headed?
Tom will die if he does that.
Are you really as old as you say you are?
I get nauseous whenever I fly.
Did you complete the work?
The ship hasn't even docked yet.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
Sometimes it's better to remain silent.
Has Tom always been fat?
Are all these books yours?
I didn't want you to read that.
Could I get one more beer, please?
I won't need luck.
He's not afraid of anyone.
Not everybody graduates.
You're winning.
I want to sleep in my own bed tonight.
I thought you could use a break.
Let's go eat. I'm starving.
He told me everything.
Please loan me your dictionary.
He has many history books.
Nobody knows.
Do you live alone?
Did you iron all the shirts?
Tom and I went to the same school.
Nobody equals him in strength.
What is it you do?
Tom helped Mary with her luggage.
I argued with him about it.
They're both in love with the same guy.
We can't keep on fooling ourselves.
Take a few steps and tell me if it hurts when you walk.
I felt tired from having worked for hours.
What time do you leave?
Do you really think it's no good?
Time cures all things.
In Washington, no one knew what to expect.
The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
She's completely blasé about the dangers of smoking.
He always puts himself first.
There's really no reason for you to go to Boston.
He caught hold of my hand.
There are no towels.
The top of Mt. Fuji was covered with snow.
Is it too late to get my money back?
Let's talk over a cold beer.
Accidents will happen when they are least expected.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
He got into his car in a hurry.
Why should we harm you?
I can prove that I am right.
Let go of the handle.
Tom has three secretaries.
He will play tennis with his friends.
He plays golf every Sunday.
What kind of tattoo do you want?
Can you read this without your glasses?
Put this on my tab, please.
You have visitors.
Tom made a sandwich.
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
We're looking for the truth.
I've made up my mind to go.
Don't jump!
You are old enough to know this.
You'll have to ask Tom that.
Go on, Tom, we're listening.
I get off at the next station.
Tom made a great deal of money last year.
I had some help.
What makes you think that isn't true?
I like to travel by myself.
It's eight o'clock at night.
You have to tighten those screws.
Tom knows that won't work.
It's his, isn't it?
I'm the teacher.
She put the key in her bag.
When should I feed the dog?
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
Tom did all he could do to help.
I can't tell you what to do.
We don't need to do this every day.
Where's the catch?
It's really, really strange.
I have important business to take care of in my office.
We're always careful.
Those are our books.
I have the master key.
That hat becomes you.
Don't sit down on the sofa.
You need to do more research.
I almost forgot to buy milk.
I don't like goat cheese at all.
I guess it depends on the weather.
Here is my baggage.
She threatened him.
In the cemetery, there is a statue of a snake biting its own tail.
This is the only alternative.
No one here will betray you.
I hated history class.
He made an abrupt departure.
I'm not going to answer any more questions.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
He likes to read books.
The professor seemed to be lost in thought.
Who do you think I am?
Tom woke Mary up in the middle of the night.
She is almost as tall as you are.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
I had to crawl under the fence.
None of these are mine.
When were these trees planted?
I have a feeling you might want to see these.
That's not very reassuring.
Stop it. You're making me blush.
Look at me.
I was afraid of my father.
Tom doesn't like to be contradicted.
I said I liked it.
I think about him often.
Do you really want to help Tom?
To drive a car, you need a license.
Tom needs our help.
My father was an actor.
You are beautiful.
The young couple ate off the same plate.
My father bought me a bicycle.
Are you seeing anybody now?
You are the only one who can help me.
Are you waiting for something?
He did not repeat the truth to anyone.
Tell me all about your plan.
We'll paint it.
Can I exchange this for something else?
Do you have any allergies?
Tom wrote Mary's number on a napkin.
We learned English.
I need to get out of this place.
Tom gave me this book.
Tom is the richest one here.
I've never forgiven Tom.
All communication with that airplane was suddenly cut off.
I can't do this by myself.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
He called off the trip.
Tom's dog attacked Mary.
How do you stay up to date?
They are all alike.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
I have been learning English these four years.
You were always very kind.
I want time instead of money.
It turns out that I have a brother.
How was your holiday?
Were you really angry?
It's self-explanatory.
I know what they mean.
You have a secret admirer.
Visitors to Switzerland admire the Alps.
Show us the room.
He had to clean his room.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
There's too much sugar in the coffee.
It was near the river that I lost my way.
Swimming should help you lose weight.
What is that over there?
What kinds of goods do you sell in your shop?
You're still green.
Tell her that I know who she is.
She was clearly satisfied with the results.
I have to go back to work now.
He isn't here now.
He lived in Ankara for six years.
The decision is not yet final.
Did they find anything?
I write poems in my free time.
She put on her overcoat before going out.
Is that thing working?
Tom's mother must've been very disappointed.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Do you think those are real?
Tom is rather optimistic.
How long will you stay in Kyoto?
How should you advertise on the Internet?
He wanted to come with us.
He will study French.
The boys look sad.
It keeps you on your toes.
He repaired his watch by himself.
They need to change their mindset.
I'm not happy about it.
Please show me another one.
I love my new job.
A boy came running toward me.
It's none of your business.
Everybody's still there.
Plastic boxes last longer.
I have a desire to go to England.
It's Tom's thirtieth birthday tomorrow.
I left you a message.
Let's not wait any longer.
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.
I need pens, notebooks and so on.
Tom has joined the army.
To my surprise, she could not answer the question.
Both my parents are at home now.
I met him the day before.
Don't worry about others.
I need a few minutes alone.
Promise me that you'll help Tom.
It's still not working.
We are liable for the damage.
He's a cardiologist.
Are you ready for today's game?
I hid it in my sock drawer.
We're tired of waiting.
Please be careful.
I brought you a present.
You will have to study harder next year.
I was so unhappy.
You should have kept it secret.
Tom always did his best to help me.
It would be a pity if you let this opportunity pass you by.
Don't be so choosy.
If you have a minute, you might want to read this.
Tom went out for a breath of fresh air.
Rebel forces prepared to fight.
He sneaked around to the back door.
This is not going to end well.
Things might've turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
If you want to succeed, use your time well.
Where's the station?
The rain just stopped. We can leave.
Has Tom ever cooked anything for you?
They looked very happy.
Don't say it in a roundabout way.
This is the book I want to buy.
I tried to call you, but I couldn't.
I think you need to buy a new pair of hiking boots.
How is Tom?
Tom thought it would be a good idea to see a doctor.
You should always ask for permission first.
That's evident.
I can't see in because the curtains are closed.
I wish I was dead.
He has this large room to himself.
He was not happy about it.
We have to talk right now.
The detective I hired called to tell me he has a promising lead.
This is a disaster.
I want to study history.
You're still too young to get a driver's license.
We could see enemy ships on the horizon.
Let Tom decide.
Tom promised me that tonight he'd sing that new song he wrote.
He didn't only teach at school, he also wrote novels.
I worked as hard as I could so I didn't fail.
This is a fundamental question.
I'm reluctant to visit him.
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
Can you stay for a few days?
Why were you so slow?
I know where the blame goes.
Cheers!
She's busy.
I feel like walking.
It is very cold here all the year round.
She looks like her mother.
We didn't hear you come in.
You'll break it if you're not careful.
Please be careful.
I can't do it alone.
I understand now why he didn't go to a university.
I'm not in love with anyone.
For further information, see page 16.
Tom didn't answer the question.
It's a present for you.
I appreciate all you've done.
I came yesterday.
I wouldn't bet on that.
He did his best to help her.
A dog followed me to my house.
Do you feel lucky?
Wait a sec.
He was attracted to the woman.
I'll do whatever it takes to save Tom.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
They were so happy together.
Are you ready to work?
Although I may be unhappy, I won't commit suicide.
I'll bring the glasses.
The two of them were never to meet again.
I just moved.
Greek is not an easy language.
Why don't we all sit down?
You have something of a reputation.
You're a little liar.
I didn't graduate.
You're stuck.
Are both of your sisters as beautiful as you are?
They're jittery.
Did you lose weight?
I have a sharp knife.
I was hoping to raise my kids in Boston.
The coffee is for me and the tea is for you.
The engine died.
I want to see the movie again.
I have only one sister.
He is mentally handicapped.
There's something I feel you should know.
I need to do that.
This is my brother, Tom.
You can do anything you want, depending on what floats your boat.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
Tom is dead.
Why are you always so aggressive?
I'd like you to mail this letter.
Eat whatever you like.
Could you please stop singing?
I'll do it tomorrow.
We apologize for the mistake.
Why are you insulting me?
Have you gone nuts?
When's the next shuttle?
They'll grow.
How long has Tom studied French?
You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in.
I have a lot of money in my savings account.
To cross the river, you can use a boat or the bridge.
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't like Mary.
We'll get you back home immediately.
Can you turn off the light?
I would walk, except it's too hot.
I'm ready now, Tom.
Why don't you understand?
Of course!
He has enough money.
When does your sister come back from work? "I don't know, but I think she'll arrive at home a few minutes before me."
I got rid of it.
Can this be just between you and me?
You might want to take a look at this.
They danced all night long.
Give me back my hat.
They're too fat.
Both were extremely rich.
You're so predictable.
I was disappointed by the news.
Look at me when I talk to you!
Tom had a little accident.
This is the most comfortable chair in our house.
I am taller.
He kept silent during the meal.
What we need is help.
That's physically impossible.
Do you have a pen?
He came at me with a knife in his hand.
The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.
Would you mind if I took a break?
Tom likes to play tennis.
Tom asked me if I would be home this evening.
I really can't understand modern sculpture.
You can have breakfast between 7 and 9.
You can't keep this a secret.
Who cares about facts?
I hate to wait.
Please get here at least fifteen minutes before the meeting starts.
What's your favorite movie?
What will you do with this camera?
It'll probably rain.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
That's an imitation.
I just want to make sure that his offer has no strings attached.
Are we safe?
He intrigues me.
He dyed his hair black.
Do you want to discuss it?
He negotiated a lower price with the real estate agent.
Didn't you promise never to tell a lie?
I'm not minimizing the consequences.
They changed the system.
Remember your promise, Tom.
He refused to pay.
I just wanted to talk to you.
This is classified.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Did I wake you up?
I make my own rules.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Do you have plans for tonight?
In some places, people died of hunger.
You're the best singer I know.
The door was locked.
I'm afraid you have got the wrong number.
The market is big.
I'll try to help you.
Someone, please help me.
Every time she coughed, she felt a great deal of pain.
The storm developed into a typhoon.
My friends invited me to dinner.
Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you.
I don't have any proof of that.
Give me my glasses.
He is a hard man to deal with.
Her derogatory remarks towards her boss caused her to lose her job.
I'm using a bowl and a spoon.
It's a no-brainer.
Tom has three mobile phones.
It isn't anyone's fault.
Tom wanted to dance with Mary.
You must be very special.
We didn't stay home yesterday.
The spell was broken and the pig turned into a man.
I still think it's unlikely that he'll come today.
Did you see it?
Did you take him back to your apartment?
Did you hear it too?
You are very attractive in blue.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
I enjoy reading.
I often meditate on the meaning of life.
All we can do is hope.
I promise to come back early.
How's married life going?
I awoke to find a bird in my room.
Tell me where to put these books.
You had better not drive a car.
This is definitely not what I wanted.
Everyone agreed.
Does that suit you?
Hold the box with both hands.
Did anybody see what happened?
Tom is the father of three children.
What have I done with my keys?
Are you sad? "No. Why would I be?"
It's a typo. Sorry.
Mom is washing the dog because he's dirty.
I'm going to hang up now.
His nose bled.
Tom is traveling by himself.
Milk does not agree with me.
Do you mind if we join you?
I cannot help wondering if he will come on time.
I'm no longer groggy.
I suggest that you try to get some sleep.
Don't make me say it.
Try not to splatter the ink.
What's the most fun you've ever had?
I would like a word with you.
It's good to talk to you.
I can't make heads or tails of what you said.
Hurry up and get in.
They asserted that it was true.
Are you referring to me?
Is that so bad?
Are you looking for us?
He's a bad influence.
She rented a four-room apartment.
He loves attention.
When do owls sleep?
You've done a terrific job.
Leave no stone unturned.
He's a sophomore.
Where did you learn this?
I have three pieces of baggage.
Tom wasn't able to find a babysitter on such short notice.
You can see that the architect paid scrupulous attention to detail.
Do you eat a lot?
I'm thirsty. Can I have a glass of water?
You have to be prepared.
I don't want to waste my time trying to do this again.
Thanks for coming.
You deserve so much more than this.
Let's divide the work equally.
A moldy loaf of bread lay on the table.
You're very forward.
You were in a coma.
Our army attacked the enemy during the night.
We're powerful.
Why are you flinching?
They're in trouble.
He was lying on his back.
I'd like to try out this new model before I buy it.
I think we should all go inside.
I was really quite stiff.
Always arrive on time.
I want you to go home.
When are we going to land?
If it had not been for civil war, they would be wealthy now.
What is it with you, anyway?
You're so bossy.
I had no idea you felt that way.
Is anyone else going?
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
I'm staying.
I was impressed with what I saw.
I think this is a nice place.
Have you told everyone when and where the meeting will be?
Please send the book by mail.
What time is the game tomorrow night?
He failed in the attempt to sail across the Pacific Ocean.
Don't you want to come inside?
I love to see you smile.
I must remind you about your promise.
I wonder if something has happened.
I lost that argument.
The dog's collar is red.
Is there a supermarket in this mall?
The police are looking into his disappearance.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I bought you a gift.
Has anybody solved this mystery?
Keep quiet.
I really don't have the time.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
Can I finish?
I suppose you're right.
An elephant has a long nose.
Is your name on the list?
They kissed inside the planetarium.
You're not allowed to eat those.
At least, no one was hurt.
I don't know what I'm going to do yet.
We must do it again.
I think you're jealous.
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
I still love you.
The boy had a mischievous smirk on his face.
My father always speaks in a very loud voice.
He was not pleased.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
I really didn't care.
You're the only person I know who regularly gets my name wrong.
I think it's time for me to speak up.
This was the best-selling book last week.
Aren't you dressed yet?
You won't be harmed.
You don't seem too worried.
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
I must do that, I think.
It's frightening.
There was only one left.
Who is that gentleman?
I put an advertisement in the newspaper saying my house was for sale.
I think my German is really bad.
We've never talked about that.
I can't wait to die.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Staying home isn't fun.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary.
There was a big gold star on the door.
I'm surprised Tom doesn't know how to sing at least one song in French.
I'm willing to try eating anything you eat.
All the lights went out.
Pay attention to what others around you are doing.
Not every student has a dictionary.
I think you did very well.
I'd like to check your blood pressure.
Can you believe this is really happening?
Can't you understand that it's impossible?
I only got your letter yesterday.
We're getting a lot better.
The idea is not new.
Their muscles are stiff.
A hot bath made me feel much better.
He used pigeons in his experiment.
This meat smells bad.
Tom was in a bad mood all day yesterday.
The girls fainted.
How come you're not dead?
This is a sociological study on abortion.
I think Tom is dependable.
He has no more strength.
Tom isn't a good car mechanic.
Look at the blackboard, everyone.
He has much more money than I have.
He did it out of kindness.
This is pretty tense, isn't it?
That was just another party.
This gentleman asks interesting questions.
We shouldn't ask why.
His daughter and my son are good friends.
If that happened, what would you do?
Tom refused to tell us what he did.
I slept through the entire movie.
How much did they give you for your old car?
Please turn on the light.
I know that Tom is busy today.
He gave some milk to the cat.
Please give me an ashtray.
What do you like to cook the most?
Nobody knows that better than you.
You'd better give up smoking.
I don't know how to contact you.
I'm searching for my brother.
Brown is not her natural hair color.
Where is Boston?
I know you considered me a close friend.
How much money do you have on you right now?
You made this all possible.
She sang a Japanese song for us.
Everyone quieted down.
She went out without saying goodbye.
He has not written to us since last February.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
There is no cure for schizophrenia.
It was broken.
Stop talking about Tom.
I'd like to get together with you tonight.
Would you like a drink?
That worked.
He is intelligent.
Please take off your shoes.
We should stick to our plan.
Why wait for Christmas?
I've lost confidence in Tom.
He pays no attention to others' feelings.
It was a great shock to me.
Words failed him.
You have a difficult schedule to keep.
All men are brothers.
He is a very imaginative writer.
I bet you're feeling really good right now.
She is very angry with me.
Tom said he was ill, which was a lie.
Never make the mistake of arguing with people for whose opinions you have no respect.
It looks like it's going to rain tomorrow.
I hope that everything is okay.
You're not old enough to drive.
There wasn't a soul in sight.
They tried a third time.
Please take me to this address.
Don't look so shocked.
I thought you were a man.
She likes tennis as well as basketball.
We have to study the matter.
I missed you guys so much!
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
He usually fed his dog cheap dog food.
There are not enough chairs for us to sit on.
More is not always better.
I don't feel like doing it.
I've been there a lot.
I want to show you something in my office.
Mary is going to help us tomorrow.
I have my own room.
What were you thinking?
I still have things left to do.
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.
I'd like to know what happened to Tom.
Are you lying to me?
How come you know all this?
Why don't you run for student council?
Very good, but you're capable of doing better.
I have not had anything to eat since this morning.
I don't know how to thank you.
I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.
Does she know you?
What are your pet peeves?
How can I prevent this from happening?
Please sign this receipt.
Could I work part-time?
I want to hear everything.
I'm not to be disturbed.
What's it sound like?
He asked me what I had been doing.
You're very forward.
Hundreds of animals were killed.
Tom ordered a cup of tea.
I can't open this jar.
I found that there was a little girl sobbing.
I just got back in town.
Everyone stayed standing.
I feel like I know you.
I got injured in the traffic accident.
I'll get my coat.
Tom began coughing.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
I don't like beef.
Are you ready?
You didn't need to hurry.
I find it hard to get up early on cold mornings.
I thought it must be something like that.
I work out.
I am weighing myself.
We have half a dozen eggs.
The baby was crying to be fed.
He regretted having been lazy.
I think we can do that.
Don't worry. It's OK.
It had nothing to do with me.
You never cease to surprise me.
I read this in the newspaper.
Don't do anything until I come.
I am sorry for you.
Thanks for having me.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
Tom went back into his office.
Why haven't we begun?
What I need worst is a haircut.
You were very busy, weren't you?
Have your paper on my desk by Monday.
They went to Edinburgh to escape from the summer heat.
I don't know why it's happening.
You look pale today.
Mary is Tom's twin sister.
I was puzzled about what to do next.
I didn't see her.
I want to see Tom again.
I don't like learning irregular verbs.
Would you like to dance?
A drunk driver was responsible for the car accident.
You can't believe anybody.
My house is north of the library.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
I used to do a lot of volunteer work.
Do you have a copy?
I know how they did it.
He was disappointed at not being invited.
Here's your change.
I'm not ashamed of what I did.
Tom has solved that problem.
He makes fun of everybody.
What a mess!
They are watching.
I'll do the dishes.
You were drunk last night, weren't you?
She was very rude to him.
Tom hasn't realized his mistake yet.
She was wearing a black hat.
He usually goes to McDonald's.
Assuming your story is true, what should I do?
I found your wallet behind the sofa.
Isn't that romantic?
You never arrive on time.
Tom is not as young as I am.
A lot of my classmates think that I'm dumb.
She always has to be the one giving orders.
The boys have gone north.
I can't trust anybody.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
It would be nice if you helped me a little.
Who knows that?
If you try, you'll succeed.
We should eat.
We need time.
I want you to take care of me.
That's their problem.
Why would someone do that?
While we were on holiday, a neighbor took care of our cat.
I think you're going to make it.
Neither of them cares for strenuous sports.
Which is cheaper?
I must find out who is behind this.
It was a bitter pill to swallow.
I didn't know you then.
Tom doesn't take his job very seriously.
And who are you working for these days?
I saw you in the park yesterday.
You are curious, aren't you?
Tom should verify that.
I don't expect to be gone long.
I often get the blues.
It depends on the weather.
Why are you busy today?
I didn't want you to know.
I just want to be perfect.
I don't know what you do.
I thought you might like some company.
The dog bit my hand.
Isn't there anything that will make you feel better?
I hear sirens.
You said that to me last week.
Don't think about stuff like that.
The original was written as a school textbook.
Tom certainly gave the impression that he wasn't planning on being there tomorrow.
Will you leave the door open?
I don't know about the others, but as for me, I'm for it.
I expect to be back next Monday.
Have you decided?
I'm going to need more money.
I can't eat all of this.
They are always short of money.
I have to buy a new pair of skis.
She will be late for dinner.
The world was on the very brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
I've tried everything.
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?
You're very fortunate.
I think we have a problem here.
You're not a millionaire.
They'll get out of class in forty minutes.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Tell us the story from beginning to end.
She stood as close to him as she could.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
When the weather was nice, Tom always left his windows open.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I've never been to a professional baseball game.
I've got nothing to report.
I know what I did.
What can Tom do?
A dance will be held in the school auditorium this Friday evening from 7:30 to 10:00.
I believe that.
This is perfectly legal.
You might as well just enjoy life.
It depends on you.
Sheep are bred for their fleece and their meat.
European currencies weakened against the dollar.
Can I borrow some money from you?
I don't have a younger sister.
She smiled.
You don't want to go to prison, do you?
Give me a drink.
He is very fond of music.
I recommend that you read that novel.
They finished 13th.
The floor gave way.
Tom is wearing a coat that is too large for him.
I just had to check on something.
I want to see you after lunch.
I couldn't hear what was happening in the next room.
You were useless.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
Good morning, everyone.
I like all of them.
Where are they sending us?
She advised him to take the money.
Things change from time to time, and one should change with them.
His sudden appearance surprised us all.
I'm done fooling around now.
You're very attractive.
That woman is strong.
Don't gloat.
Why are you dressed like that?
Every room was searched thoroughly.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
He made a mistake on purpose.
He will be my deputy while I am away.
Does anyone see a difference?
Why can't we just take a cab?
I think we'd better ask Tom what he thinks.
Hackers were able to break into the company's computer system and undermine its network security.
I bike to work.
I liked having you here tonight.
It's a good thing to read good books when you are young.
I love you the best of all.
I was disqualified.
I'm a fan of German opera.
Mind your own business!
What do you want me to do with these?
Go get some water.
Can you tell me why Tom isn't here?
I think you'll have fun doing that.
Bring it here.
He is very mean to me.
We have to get up early tomorrow morning.
Your brother is very angry.
She advised him to stop smoking.
They will have a good laugh when they see you like this.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen.
If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it.
Are you going to sing here?
We took a taxi so we wouldn't be late.
Let's go tomorrow afternoon.
I can't believe you'd do that.
I found out something interesting today at work.
This letter is addressed to you.
Tom tried to run away.
Quit acting like a child.
I don't feel any pain.
How much money did you spend in total?
What sort of person are you?
I like these.
You can't rely on him these days to do a proper job.
His story was so funny that everyone could not help laughing.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
Now is your chance.
Tom died suddenly of a stroke.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
Both policemen were killed.
How long did it take you to write this report?
Tom asked me not to help him.
How much is the ticket?
If I had had more money, I would have bought the pen.
It's up to you to keep things running smoothly.
I don't have a passport.
Tom always tells the truth.
Tom found out our secret.
Red wine, please.
His wife is one of my friends.
I'm not a very good artist.
May I go to the bathroom?
His father disapproved of him.
The flimsy stalls in this restroom offer very little privacy.
The ceremony began with his speech.
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
He often gets angry at small things.
You're going to lose.
Maybe she can tell you more.
I knew that would interest you.
He did a good job.
It's two miles from here to the station.
He likes drinking coffee without sugar.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Let's play baseball.
They kidnapped me.
I don't like being on my own.
Do you live alone?
Can I have the paper when you're finished with it?
I asked the stranger where he was from.
Tom told Mary he wasn't married.
Put some clothes on.
I like to talk.
Japan has enjoyed prosperity since the war.
The bad weather delayed the plane's departure by two hours.
I think I can sing fairly well.
Have you already finished?
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
You can do whatever you want to.
I'd like to get married to someone like you.
It didn't happen that way.
Do you know how many people died in yesterday's plane crash?
I made these.
What've you got?
He went hunting in the woods.
I have to take the entrance examination today.
He is leaving Chicago tomorrow.
These are my favorite pair of shoes.
Why not use robots?
This made me very sad.
I gave Tom chocolate.
He didn't come back to the base yesterday.
I wonder where Tom and Mary went.
It's hard to predict what the weather will be like tomorrow.
I would like to eat something.
I can help you out.
Tom brought a case of beer.
She asked him if he knew where I lived.
Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.
A mirror reflects light.
You need to grow up.
Let me use your computer.
I tried hard.
You seem to have the wrong number.
You don't know who I am.
Show me your passport, please.
No kidding?
Tom never said that.
She worships him.
Tom, say something.
You're such a liar.
His parents want him to go to college.
Tom has decided to have the surgery.
The lock is broken.
Against all expectations, we became good friends.
I need to know what this means.
Do you miss it?
I want you to sleep on it.
What's this computer doing here?
Come home early.
It makes no difference whether the train is delayed or not.
Are you giving me another chance?
That's really funny.
I have never seen her help her father.
You're crafty.
I found a place to live.
I gave it back.
Look what I found at the supermarket today.
I don't know what plan he will try.
She has legally divorced her husband.
We must go to school.
I know you have a girlfriend.
The book was published posthumously.
Need a lift?
What I did was wrong.
If I'm not mistaken, I think we took a wrong turn back there.
The bill passed at the last moment.
Who is he?
Please speak more loudly.
Tom won the contest last year.
The bus stopped, but no one got out.
Yeah, you're right.
That blouse fits you well.
It's kind of important.
Play that song again.
You're incredible.
I'm through.
It doesn't matter.
Go slow.
Someone broke into my house last weekend.
We didn't recognize each other.
His parents were pleased with his success.
I need paint.
He rested for a while.
Do you want to resign?
Did he tell you the truth?
We're all here.
Are you seriously thinking about getting involved?
We couldn't have done this without your help.
I think we should stop doing that.
We're both on the same side.
I know that you feel helpless.
Tom has enough money to buy the house he wants.
Guess who won.
I want to go over these numbers with you.
My father made me a delicious lunch.
We needed this.
Take a look at these.
How exactly would that work?
Is it a compliment?
Aren't you afraid of anything?
I'll wait for you here.
Tom's diabetic.
Are you lying to me?
Nearly one billion people around the globe lack access to clean, safe water.
Are you going to sell Tom your house?
A nurse wears white.
She was advised by him to give up drinking.
You don't need to stand up.
Tom is chubby.
There used to be a hotel around here.
I feel cold.
My father is in the garden now.
He cannot have said so.
You can't have the job.
You've taken everything.
Tom likes snow.
Tom was holding something in his left hand.
The police could not control the mob.
Tom probably shouldn't have bought such an expensive bass guitar.
I figured I'd find you here.
After working all week, we took it easy on Sunday.
I tried to protect you.
We apologize.
Who did you vote for?
He is in his library.
He assumed an aggressive attitude toward me.
He hung a picture on the wall.
He's nervous and gets scared easily.
Tom isn't a very good farmer.
I am to take over my father's business.
He is a student.
The storm did great damage to her property.
You look like a cop.
I'll play a sonata for you.
I think it's time for me to clean the garage.
I know how they did it.
Have you heard of me?
We went up the mountain by cable car.
I'm very serious.
It is still light outside.
Where's the nearest gas station?
She sang a Japanese song for us.
Her death was a great shock to me.
He did the work in two days.
Where's the book I need?
Tom is a very shy boy.
Do you know who he is?
He put the key on the desk as usual.
If you add one hundred to one thousand, you get eleven hundred.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Tom can trust Mary.
I refuse to answer the question.
I was to have finished the work yesterday.
Are you thirsty?
There's no time.
He was afraid of his wife.
In 1683, the Turks besieged Vienna for the second time.
What are the chances of that happening?
They were so frightened that they couldn't move an inch.
You should smoke less.
Do you know the difference between a microscope and a telescope?
The moral of the story is that you can't trust the system.
I took it for granted that you were on our side.
I had chicken pox when I was a kid.
I really like puppies.
Let me go!
Don't waste your time thinking about it.
I have no more than one hundred yen with me.
I've got to get ready for school.
I'll pray for you.
They have hostages.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Tom didn't understand the question.
I guess that means we're winning.
America is very large.
I need a breather.
We promised.
They're all gone.
Quakers believe that all people are equal.
I am very happy to hear about your engagement.
I often refer to the dictionary.
Where's all this coming from?
They say that he is very rich.
She plays the piano very well.
Tom has tattoos on his arms.
You must be cautious.
You have done very well.
Curiosity got the better of him.
Do you think it's wise to wear your uniform today?
Can you jump over a chair from a standing position?
Promise me you won't do that again.
I don't know why Tom is whispering.
We used to go to the movies on Saturday evening.
Tom claims to have psychic powers.
I need to repay her.
My father is far from artistic.
Every family has a skeleton in the closet.
What do you think happened to Tom?
We don't need to go there.
Tom burned all of the letters that Mary had sent him.
Put the tables end to end.
What did you eat?
Where are your things?
Bread and milk are good foods.
If you tell too many lies, people won't ever believe you.
Excuse me, does this train go to Washington Square?
How many sisters do you have?
This gun is reportedly very powerful.
The person responsible has been fired.
How much does the shirt cost?
Life is like a roller coaster ride.
The situation got worse.
I'll have skim milk.
I'm sure that Tom will do that.
Tom smelled funny.
Let's sing a song.
Where did you put my umbrella?
Please tell us about it.
There are no stupid questions.
He went away in a hurry.
As far as I know, he's an excellent student.
He said he had come to Japan the previous week.
We work every day but Sunday.
Do you talk to your plants?
What did you get for Christmas?
Do you want me to make coffee?
There's not enough room for everybody.
The rule holds good in this case.
It seems that he is aware of the fact.
No one seems to know the answer.
You can take it.
It's so beautiful.
Why are you running?
What kind of beer do you have?
I'm glad you liked my friends.
My plan was rejected.
He blew out the candles on the cake.
I bought a red diary.
All of Tom's predictions came true.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
We don't know what they want to use it for.
I found out when we're supposed to arrive.
I thought I was alone.
I like to eat watermelon.
I have rights.
I made the deal.
I want you to do it at once.
The firemen rushed into the burning house.
I think otherwise.
It's hard to understand his ideas.
This is pretty bad.
The recent events have affected him deeply.
We acted in good faith.
He dashed out of the store.
We should place much value on the environment.
Tom used to be my boyfriend.
I was terribly confused by his question.
They won't get the chance.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
This is the restaurant that I often eat at.
I can come back another time.
We're obedient.
The goods arrived undamaged.
Your parents know where you are.
Are you through with the newspaper?
I'm free every day but Monday.
Tom understood me.
It's a shame that the singer died so young.
I said stay back.
What's for lunch today?
If I had time, I'd accept his invitation.
Women age faster than men.
He was shorter than me.
He scares easily.
Never be this late again.
You aren't in a hurry, are you?
Give me another chance.
The water flows under the bridge.
I've never trusted you and I never will.
He was deprived of his civil rights.
You don't know what this is, do you?
I must renew my passport.
Where do dreams come from?
Sooner or later, he will run out of luck.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
I am married.
Tom had never been late for work before.
She told him that she was happy.
I think he's hiding something from me.
I haven't been happy for a long time.
Did you take the book back to the library?
It's not a suitable topic for discussion.
Nobody in my family can do that.
He is awesome.
None of them know French.
I didn't know the city, and what's more, I couldn't speak a word of the language.
I love to swim.
It's already late.
Mary has her problems.
I wonder if you ever think of me.
You can't hypnotize me.
He showed it to me.
Everyone is waiting on you.
I don't recall asking for your advice.
Move out of the way.
I'm saving up for my old age.
Can you recommend a good book?
I can't believe you lied to me.
Tom doesn't like Boston much.
The train has not arrived yet.
They had had to use what money they had.
You may use my new car.
Three of the hostages were beheaded.
It's not that noticeable.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
A big earthquake occurred in Tokyo.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
We learn a lot from experience.
Mary took the cookies out of the oven.
My mother's going to kill me.
I suggest you not talk so loud.
Tell me why she is crying.
They were all good swimmers.
Isn't that why we're here?
He denied that he was the thief.
I've never met him.
We live in a complicated world.
I wish I could be more spontaneous.
Mary rested her head on Tom's shoulder.
We have no comment at this time.
He got the book for nothing.
Day after day, the dog sat waiting for his master in front of the station.
You're not tired, are you?
I didn't pretend to be your friend.
Tom asked a question.
I need to talk to you in person.
Tom wants to come with us to Boston.
She has no opinion about religion.
It's an unusual name.
Don't you know who I am?
Don't be such a fool.
Goats can eat almost anything.
I know what you did.
We are good friends.
Don't you just hate technology?
I've been to Boston quite a few times.
The joke's on you.
Buy him a beer.
I want you to speak frankly.
We were watching TV when the bell rang.
I hate to run the risk, but I have no choice.
Did you get all that?
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
We'll have a better chance of surviving if we stay calm.
That brand of tequila really packs a wallop.
She's pregnant.
He used to love her.
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
You're the teacher.
That's my cat.
I love visiting Boston.
What happened to you last night?
There is a lot of money.
They don't know what they are missing.
I've never told anyone why I have trouble sleeping.
No one's allowed in.
Your fries are getting cold.
The escalator suddenly stopped.
I'm not suggesting anything.
Tom can't find his umbrella.
It doesn't seem fair, does it?
Zero comes before one.
The long wait is over.
Tom is a car mechanic.
I can't see.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
He was unable to completely give up on his hopes of marrying her.
The company he used to work for went into bankruptcy last month.
I refused to be paid.
I'll mow the lawn tomorrow if it's not raining.
Do you want to buy this?
I'd like to be more than just friends.
She wrote about it in her diary.
There was an explosion.
It's hard to find a good job these days.
My car is being repaired.
Would you be friends with me?
Supper is served at nine-thirty.
That would be unprofessional.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
That is the sort of job I am cut out for.
He took a walk before breakfast.
I wish to be a doctor.
Please stop talking like that.
This diamond is fake.
Everyone should know this.
You should go home early.
I'm sure it was an accident.
Tom opened the book and flipped through the pages.
We live on Park Street.
I've been asked to give this to you.
At last, he solved the problem.
Any bed is better than no bed.
Even the cleverest students can make silly mistakes.
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.
They were motivated by revenge.
A truck was standing in the middle of the road.
The family had a hard time after the war.
This water is a little salty.
I love books.
I don't have any evidence.
Tom is still at his grandfather's house.
She turned down every proposal.
We leave in half an hour.
I've got to speak to you.
He is too honest to tell a lie.
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
Tom learned how to read and write at school.
Tom and Mary are students.
This is the longest novel that I have ever read.
I was forced to accept his proposal.
Tom certainly gets a nice sound out of that old bassoon.
Tom is laughing.
He lacks experience.
Tom doesn't think that Mary's performance was very good.
I thought you'd be happy.
What did they say to you?
I can't wait to be with you.
We never learned what happened or why.
You need to sleep.
When my wife's friend comes to visit, I find it hard to get a word in edgeways.
He has to be taller than me.
Can you crank up the heat?
You must have been surprised to find me alone with her last night.
You're skinny.
The game was called off.
Would you happen to be married?
My father bought me a bicycle.
How could you be so cruel?
Was there a fire?
They are discussing the problem.
What's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?
Where can I catch the bus for Obihiro?
We have to take this problem into consideration.
Tom lives in the middle of nowhere.
Why are you so insecure?
I used to tell people I knew how to speak French.
That movie was pretty boring.
You have to come with me.
It isn't easy to learn a foreign language.
I think Tom is going to be OK.
Don't move or I'll shoot.
Do you want to go in?
She wrote to him to tell him that she couldn't come to visit next summer.
They laughed.
How are things going?
You can't bury the truth.
What are you going to do today?
Please knock on the door.
Who picked you for this mission?
Tom drives a black car, doesn't he?
I try to do it once a week.
Is there someone here who speaks French?
I will behave.
Memorize it.
The sentence is free from grammatical mistakes.
It's difficult to evaluate his ability.
Tom waited for Mary to continue.
I can only speak English.
All graduates are invited.
How do you feel today?
How did you become interested in studying languages?
We watched the soccer game on TV.
Open your book to page nine.
It's been three years since I began studying French.
We have no money.
I didn't expect that result.
She looked for her children, but couldn't find them anywhere.
How did you get here so fast?
I'm just worried about my weight.
Fill out this form, please.
Tom admitted he had accepted a bribe.
How many pockets does that jacket have?
I enjoyed your company.
I like singing and playing the guitar.
She was born and brought up in Osaka.
She showed us a beautiful hat.
I can't distinguish a frog from a toad.
It's not quite normal.
You're not allowed to swim here.
Is there something I can do for you?
There's nothing else I need to buy.
I have to shine my shoes.
Did you do all this?
I'm not expecting special treatment.
I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
Tom is your age.
The President is usually accompanied by his wife when he goes abroad.
It is better to have old second-hand diamonds than none at all.
We're here alone.
You've run out of things to drink.
I have two daughters and two sons.
It's free of charge.
His speech went on for such a long time that some people began to fall asleep.
My uncle gave me a book yesterday. This is the book.
You'll be missed by your friends.
There is a window on your left.
Let me deal with this.
If I were caught, do you know what would happen?
I ordered the children to stay quiet, but they kept on making noise.
All I ask is that you show up on time.
I thought we were going out to dinner.
They were all actors.
That should be enough.
Take out your notebooks.
You can go wherever you want to go.
He's such a jerk.
There's one thing I must tell you.
Sorry for not answering your question. I didn't see it.
It made sense.
He took out his handkerchief.
I won't be able to help you.
She went out.
Are they satisfied?
He picked up a red stone.
You can't blame him.
She has asked the person at the front desk to connect her to that number.
That kind of thing can happen when you're in a hurry.
It was very cold.
I study Chinese in Beijing.
Don't think about it now.
He is his own master.
I'd like a shrimp cocktail.
You have my attention already.
All you have to do is push this button.
Don't move!
Tom is actually not sleeping.
We're all being manipulated.
Are you a registered voter?
After our first attack, the enemy fled.
I plan to write Tom a letter.
Tom will never agree to that.
Tom looked around, but Mary was already gone.
Tom says he's having trouble coping with the stress.
Come and sit by me.
Nobody is going to hurt you.
Why is that so hard to believe?
He's not available.
Why does Tom want a horse?
I agree completely with you on this point.
I had no alternative.
The bird spread its wings.
Is there something you haven't told me?
I suspected that something like this might happen.
He gave me some money.
Tom didn't give it back to me.
I did that the way you suggested.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
Tom and Mary were sitting at a table in the corner.
I cannot afford a camera above 300 dollars.
We need to make a big decision.
Would you trust them?
I saw him.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
I do want to be your friend.
I don't think Tom was mistaken.
The doctor examined my throat.
I'll arrange it.
When I was in high school, I was the best student in my class.
You'll want to look your best tomorrow.
You saved us all.
He loves me for who I am.
Tom put on his coat and left.
In addition to that, he failed the examination.
Do you want to know what I think?
We'll do it tomorrow.
I had my watch stolen.
Take as many cookies as you want.
I'll be careful with the kids.
You can't just walk away from this mess.
We're the same age.
I have absolutely no idea when I'm supposed to do that.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
Your daughter is not a child anymore.
I'm home, Tom.
This would be a mistake.
That has nothing to do with it.
We entered into a serious conversation.
Don't leave town.
You're not safe here.
That's something we should probably take care of right away.
Keep children away from the pond.
Tom will find it.
Whether Shakespeare wrote this poem or not will probably remain a mystery.
She quit her job for some reason.
Mother prepared us lunch.
Let's take a ten-minute break.
He asked me where she lived.
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary.
D.H. Lawrence is a novelist and poet.
I've no idea.
This isn't what I asked for.
They're probably Americans.
He's better at the piano than I am.
It's not possible to do two things at once.
This room doesn't get much sunshine.
Chew your food well.
A few days ago, you didn't even want to talk to me.
Do you have paper?
Let's do it at our own pace without hurrying.
I would like to work with your company.
Don't wait up for me.
There is a mistake in this sentence.
Don't make any loud noises.
They must have had an accident.
Where did you get all that money from?
I feel safe.
I want to stay alive.
What a nightmare!
The horse stopped and wouldn't move.
Tom is always here on Mondays.
You are my hero.
Don't call me a jerk.
Tom has been blind since birth.
It's only a book.
No one thinks so.
I'm the new teacher.
They said no.
I had some interesting experiences while traveling.
Ten to one, he will succeed.
This cake tastes like it has cheese in it.
I had a crush on you when we were in high school.
I was really unlucky.
I think you should go now.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
That's what I got.
You're a wonderful friend.
I bought the book.
You're fired.
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
She is lucky.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
Tom and I used to be neighbors.
Please put it back in its place.
I'm the richest one here.
School bores me.
The cop went through his pockets, but found nothing.
It's not a loan.
Everybody makes mistakes once in a while.
What do you think this is?
I'd like you to translate this book into English.
What will become of me?
He was found mysteriously murdered.
Computers are capable of doing extremely complicated work.
The train finally arrived.
What's your strategy?
We're gardeners.
I don't think I can wait any longer.
Can we just not talk for a minute?
You're my kid's teacher.
None of this is your fault.
Look at those clouds.
This is an important event.
I just wanted to see what it was like.
She asked us several questions.
The concert hasn't started yet.
Tom took the hook out of the fish's mouth.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Who's to say which is better?
I advised him to keep that promise.
He is always a step or two ahead of the times.
I looked in the window.
They started at the same time.
They're both right.
She's unconscious.
It was just a joke. Lighten up!
Tom's family owns this bakery.
You're not allowed to eat those.
We've spent too much money.
I can't imagine what life would be like without you.
I don't like your smile.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
Have you ever built a house?
Something is wrong with my watch.
I think we may have met somewhere before.
He may still be young, but he really is a reliable person.
You need help doing that, I think.
Can you believe it?
I'm not going to betray you.
I can't figure out the answer to this problem.
That part is frustrating.
No one is in the room.
I heard you don't eat meat.
You snooze, you lose.
I got up early yesterday.
I wish I could speak English.
You've been busy, haven't you?
May I eat this?
How many boys are there in your class?
I want you to come somewhere with me.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
You're my only real friend.
Change is inevitable.
Some large birds prey upon small birds and animals.
Go get it.
I want to discuss this with your manager.
You can go anyplace you like.
This isn't the best one we have.
Air is to men what water is to fish.
He's not always at home on Sundays.
Pay at the cash register.
I don't think I can trust you anymore.
I would rather not go there alone.
Please tell Tom I'm sorry.
He told me not to drive too fast.
We have a surprise.
She accompanied me to the hospital.
You were scared, weren't you?
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
He told us he had gone through many hardships.
I'm so happy, I feel like I could fly.
He dropped her a line.
They have us out-gunned, but we'll have the element of surprise.
He loves singing.
I can't recall her name at the moment.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
Thank you for helping me carry my suitcases.
Can I make a couple of suggestions?
They are out shopping.
I can't believe that you enjoyed that movie.
Even though I had eaten a lot for breakfast, I was already hungry.
They're not coming.
I would like to drink something.
He donated countless pieces to the museum.
Would you be friends with me?
Do you think he's really into me?
Try to have fun tonight.
One of my friends died last week.
I thought I heard you.
You need to work together.
I'll be a little late today.
There used to be an old temple here.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
I don't think I could live without you.
Tom is our best player.
He will be having dinner with her at this time tomorrow.
There is an apple on the desk.
Where is it located?
The dog is theirs.
I guess I could use some advice.
Do you need me to give you some money?
Tom is the one I gave the key to.
Who is it?
He's doing his German homework.
We took turns driving.
He is equal to the task.
He is the tallest boy.
You're pretty.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride in his success.
The rich are not always happier than the poor.
Don't you remember anything?
That could've been prevented.
I've already made amends to most of the people on my list.
He seemed really nervous.
In the speech, he referred to the strength of the company.
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
You'll need this more than I do.
Everybody expected that the experiment would result in failure.
I thought that was your job.
Don't make the same mistake again.
Today is very cold.
I don't know yet, but I'll find out soon enough.
The moon came out from behind the clouds.
Tom could do with some help.
It rained all day yesterday.
Who made this cake?
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
Are you telling me how to do my job?
He acknowledged his faults.
Are you sure he can do this?
He implied that something was wrong with his marriage.
I'd like to make a statement.
Tom wanted to see Mary happy.
I love the way you think.
Take it, please.
You are very attractive in blue.
A lot of people swim here in the summer.
I saved you.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
I never touched Tom.
Your kiss is sweeter than honey.
We lost a lot of time.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner.
I'm not all that busy.
The actress was dressed beautifully.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
She has a picture.
You were kind to help me.
Tom took a day off.
I'll give you a lift.
He directed all his energy to his business.
Most of the policemen lost their jobs.
Tom doesn't understand this.
You must learn to adapt.
Get out if you can.
Fur protects animals from the cold.
I feel like a rest.
What time do you leave for school?
I got remarried.
Have I kept you waiting?
Think of your brother.
He was eager for news.
He is taller than his father.
If you want to, we'll go.
Tom is pretty good at chess.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Those grapes look sweet, but in fact they're sour.
We loaded a lot of luggage into the car.
I want to know who that is.
He won't leave us alone.
Everyone noticed.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
Have you eaten?
The pleasure is mine.
It's one thing to make plans, but quite another to carry them out.
I don't have an opinion either way.
I almost bought that same tie.
She was very surprised at the news.
My daughter is often sick.
Use them all.
I suppose it can't be helped.
I'd like to believe that's true.
I don't need to tell you anything.
This was on the doorstep.
Tom sat in the darkness.
Tom hasn't played the guitar for years.
They all drank.
She drives very fast.
She always got up early.
This isn't my umbrella. It belongs to someone else.
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
I've learned how to relax.
It is never too late to learn.
This plant isn't edible.
She kept on dancing all through the party.
Are you still thirsty?
I guess that's right.
I've been told that.
Let's get the work over with so we can relax.
Are you American?
Is that a yes or no?
It's a nice party.
I wonder if you have something to write with.
I didn't cry.
I'm so tired.
What is he like?
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Tom usually goes to school by bus.
I will play tennis this afternoon.
She was named after her grandmother.
He aspires to become a teacher.
Are you American?
I was younger then.
Since you have nothing to do with this matter, you don't have to worry.
I had never seen a panda till that time.
He is a bad boy.
We should call Tom immediately.
Yesterday I happened to run into Tom on the street.
Tom had to run.
They're cleaning the beach.
He occupies a prominent position in the firm.
It is illegal to park a car there.
Tom didn't know he'd hurt anybody.
Are they actually friends?
This is the important part.
I plan to throw all of this away. You may take whatever you like.
She is always complaining about my small salary.
I don't suppose anything will happen.
I think it's good for you to read this book.
The teacher asked me a difficult question.
I don't want you to be hurt.
I'm a friend.
You might want to reconsider that.
His influence extends all over the country.
His hobby is painting pictures of flowers.
Why ask me? Wouldn't it be better to do it yourself?
If that doesn't work, try something else.
Where are the potatoes?
I went for a drive in the country.
After she had lunch, she got ready to go out.
Where did they learn this?
I was unable to attend the party, nor did I want to.
Tom is optimistic.
Would you like to leave a message?
She was a bit late.
You're very good.
Tom doesn't know what this is. Do you?
My, you're looking green around the gills.
We're on schedule.
Please hand this in at the front desk.
How many boys are in this class?
He is a man whose heart is filled with hope.
I play video games.
The server is down again.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
There's nothing I can do about it.
You were happy, weren't you?
I think it's time for me to go back to work.
How much does this computer cost?
Please don't leave me here by myself.
You really should eat before you leave.
Could you not do that here?
Once he had written the letter, he sent it.
I had my suitcase carried up to my room.
I have homework.
I'll make this up to you.
Neither is correct.
How did you find out where Tom lives?
I think that's just what I need right now.
You look like a girl.
I wasn't sure about that.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
That's a big blow.
I'll answer that question.
She's not the lying type.
That was a good idea.
I never imagined I'd be working for you.
He isn't afraid to die.
Well then, what are we waiting for?
It looks like an apple.
I think there's no point in trying to convince him.
She decided to marry him.
I've decided to go back to school.
Tom never liked Mary.
Didn't your parents teach you anything?
I did a bad thing.
Her hobby was collecting old coins.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
We don't need these things.
I heard everything.
I thought that was impossible.
She's not here.
The students seem to be sleepy today.
Thank you for helping me out.
Scream as loud as you can.
I feel so helpless.
Tom is a good person.
They stood on the top of the hill.
I have fulfilled my promise.
That book is very old.
His explanation doesn't make sense at all.
You may leave your bag here.
He regrets what he did.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
Everyone should know this.
I didn't think this would happen.
He looked at her from head to foot.
You're my daughter.
Why are you out of breath?
Today, we turn ten years old.
I talked to everybody.
Where's your shirt?
That's great!
What did you do then?
I can't find what I want.
I'm always proud of my family.
Send me a postcard.
They weren't at home yesterday.
She was brought up by him.
Let's not worry about it.
I fell down the stairs.
I hope that I'll see her.
I want you to handle this.
How long have you been doing this?
I'm proud of you guys.
It was a huge explosion.
How can it be done?
Which train should I take to go to Shibuya?
Schools are closed.
Is this your favorite song?
I understand your position perfectly.
Please fasten your seat belt.
Can you recommend a place for me to stay in London?
You're really incredible.
I got what I needed.
It's fun to learn a foreign language.
I look after my grandfather.
He was accused of cowardice.
Don't make me come after you.
Tom spent the whole morning getting ready for his presentation.
I haven't finished my breakfast yet.
I am going to bed.
Kyoto was the former capital of Japan.
I hate moving.
He was embarrassed.
I take full responsibility for this.
Don't talk about it in his presence.
How do we explain this?
Did you live here?
I'm not interested at all.
How much will it be?
You need to work fast.
Tom is now very angry with me.
They're strong.
I can't understand his feelings.
We stayed at a cheap hotel.
From our point of view, his proposal is reasonable.
I'm not short.
He was about to speak.
I can't remember his name.
We're getting nowhere with those problems.
Does Tom speak French?
I like this coat. May I try it on?
My house is on a hill.
I dreamed I had been abducted by aliens.
As far as I know, he is honest.
She cleared the dishes from the table after dinner.
That's not all that happened.
Tom is a good administrator.
Are you in Paris?
There are many parks in our town.
You can't go out.
Tom went there to meet Mary.
My father bought me a bicycle.
I didn't break it.
What is the weather like today?
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
He accomplishes whatever he sets out to do.
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?
We're bored.
We managed to swim across the river.
I've got no worries.
I'm afraid there isn't any coffee left.
He helps her.
I want you to know what's true and what's not.
I don't know when he'll come.
What's got into you?
I can't kiss you the way you want to be kissed.
Tom never used to smoke, but he does now.
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.
I awoke to find everything had been a dream.
You can skate safely on this side of the lake.
He swims like a fish.
I can't read French, nor can I speak it.
For the time being, I must share this room with my friend.
Tom's room is tidy.
The workman died from the explosion.
I don't believe this is really happening.
There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
Don't scare me like that!
Are you going to stop me?
Get a hold of yourself.
You've been warned.
Have you asked if they want one?
He was impressed.
They couldn't help us.
I like you.
There are few legal constraints on the sale of firearms in the U.S.
I grabbed the dog by its collar.
My mother cut my hair too short.
What foods are you allergic to?
How do I change my cell phone's ringtone?
He has the ability to do the work.
When I was feeding my dog, I noticed that the gate had been left open.
You should make sure that you tie a bowline.
I saw a strange woman there.
Someone ate all the cookies.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
This is the only one I have.
What's in there?
He didn't want to sell the book.
Don't be cruel to animals.
He was heard singing the song.
Tom's heart suddenly began to beat faster.
It's a cinch to learn to swim.
He raised his hand to stop a taxi.
Are you good at keeping secrets?
The shoes are worn out.
It doesn't get better than this.
I have to be back home by seven.
She died before coming of age.
Hurry up, girls.
Speak your mind.
He likes country music.
This medicine will soothe your headache.
He went fishing in the river.
I'm glad you called.
You're a good boy.
There's no telling when she'll stab you in the back.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
For your own safety, never ride in a car with a drunk driver.
Stay calm and do your best.
Luckily nobody got wet.
I'm not like the rest of these guys.
Tom guessed the right answer.
You need to be more patient.
Let's talk about this later.
I have a new pair of socks.
It's only a dream.
This work doesn't pay.
I sat in the front of the bus.
Do you think about Tom a lot?
We have a problem.
I saw some cars in the parking lot.
You have done very well.
The door is locked.
It will stop raining soon.
Business is business.
How long have you been waiting for the bus?
Could I talk to you for a minute?
I made a big mistake.
You're disloyal.
I'd like to be a veterinarian.
I understand your frustration.
I bought this yesterday.
Could you call me back a bit later?
Tom took the wrong bus.
Who are you talking with?
I needed a break, so I took one.
The Confederate flag was lowered.
You must stick to your diet.
It's easier to spend a lot than to save a little.
He stared at me.
Tom used to eat a lot of meat.
Your French is improving.
I didn't sleep long enough.
In other words, she's dumb.
Why don't you ask me what you really want to know?
I'll be back before you know it.
This one is on me.
I heard the message.
Do you go to the movies often?
A hug from you would make me happy.
Where did you learn that?
Please don't call the cops.
According to the weather forecast, it will clear up tomorrow.
Leave this to me.
I can't remember anything from last night.
I'm outraged.
It's a bit intimidating.
I met a Canadian man named Tom.
I'll finish it later.
Tom claims he can accurately predict the future.
You're contradicting yourself.
Who's the better driver?
We'll make our announcement on Thursday.
You won't find anything here.
I had it all planned.
I played an interesting game of chess against the computer last week.
He smiled and said goodbye.
The arrow indicates the way to go.
I opened the door slowly.
Tom told me that he wasn't used to speaking in public.
I'm learning music.
I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
He wiped the sweat off his face.
How much did you spend on Christmas gifts this year?
Clearly you are mistaken.
Don't lose your purse.
If you trespass on his property, he'll sic his dogs on you.
Tom will be here tonight.
His father was a policeman.
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
Who cleaned it?
He went home at six.
We bought a round table.
You handled that situation quite well.
I know nothing about music.
It's a big concern.
That was a cheap shot.
He is as old as my father.
This is the place where my father was born.
I am completely out of breath.
Don't even say that as a joke.
I'd appreciate it if you could do that.
We made a good team.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
Do you know the difference?
Tell me you're not serious!
Even the richest man in the world can't buy everything.
I saw you.
How many people do you think die from cancer every year?
No one is sure how many people died.
He raised his hand.
They all speak French.
Don't forget to pay the phone bill.
I know that I'm supposed to enjoy this class, but I don't.
Go have some fun.
Tom was in good shape.
Never choose a vocation just because it is popular or sounds interesting.
I thought you were broke.
She died yesterday afternoon.
Why did they hire you?
Am I understood?
I may not graduate.
They could've killed you.
Please do something about it.
Show me something new.
Don't get discouraged.
Let's do our best.
You don't have to apologize.
I think we need more water.
We all consider your idea to be impractical.
How did you get into my house?
Your answer is wrong.
If he's proficient in English, I'll hire him.
I told you this is where we'd find Tom.
I no longer like you.
They had a heated discussion.
It is true that he is young, but he is wise.
I want you home by midnight.
I want to wait and see what they propose.
The fire was put out immediately.
They have plenty of water.
You seem distracted today.
All of us plan to do that.
I want you to love me for who I am.
Your sister's as beautiful as ever.
Are you still thinking about applying to Harvard?
We didn't see any children at all.
I assure you that I can do that.
The most essential thing in the world to any individual is to understand himself.
I thought I knew everything.
I had a very hard time writing the paper.
I did it a few times.
I can't let you go in there alone.
Tom doesn't know where Mary usually goes skiing.
I have a key.
He tried to swim against the tide.
I won't be pressured into doing something I don't want to do.
Why are they here?
You speak pretty good French.
I would like to see it.
Tom makes me feel safe.
Tom and Mary are on good terms with each other.
When was the last time that you went to a zoo?
No one has come forward to claim responsibility for what happened.
They agreed on everything.
A screen divided the room into two.
Was it good?
None of them look surprised.
Maybe he will be a good teacher.
They all can drive.
He sat there with his legs crossed.
I just can't take it.
Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.
Where did you park the car?
I'll handle things.
Don't you hear those sirens?
Are you kidding?
This place is perfect.
We can't just act as if nothing has happened.
I managed to catch the 8 o'clock train by running all the way to the station.
I wasn't scared at all.
I know that Tom is all right now.
These cars are ours.
This a very significant discovery.
How did you know I was going to say yes?
I'm very happy.
I was overwhelmed.
There's something I want you to know.
It was raining heavily when I got up this morning.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
I don't often get invited to parties.
Come again tomorrow.
I'd like to confirm my reservation for the 30th.
Let me try it.
She's much happier than him.
Our team did not reach the playoffs this year.
I wish I had eaten more.
This is your hat, isn't it?
I don't mind even if she doesn't come.
I'm sick of this.
The breakfast dishes were still in the sink.
Everybody jumped.
Tom said he was starving.
You're impatient.
He feels weak after his illness.
Have a drink while you're waiting.
May I show you something?
Please help yourself.
Is this what you're looking for?
I was really young when I met you.
It's a little dated.
Time is up.
I am poor at swimming.
It was a bold decision.
What kind of girl are you?
Can't this wait until things are back to normal?
Circumstances did not permit me to help you.
What have we done to be punished like this?
We want to go to the beach.
He got his watch fixed.
I decided to ask for my friend's help.
It was superb.
How was today's game?
Tell me how to spell your name.
You should follow his advice.
I bet Tom liked his birthday present.
I don't have time for a walk.
It's Tom.
Are you telling us the truth?
I didn't read the whole thing.
Metal spoons are generally made of stainless steel.
Everyone laughed at him.
This one is bigger.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
You had better not start until they arrive.
I just want to know if you love me.
I want to die soon.
I will never have a daughter.
What did you see?
I don't appreciate your attitude.
Please don't go away.
Did you see anyone leave?
My father cut wood with a saw.
It is true that the earth is round.
You're free to go.
I got paid today.
I should get to Boston by lunchtime.
Tell me about your daily life.
We can't be sure, can we?
My sister is afraid of all doctors.
Do you prefer white rice or brown rice?
I believe in miracles.
We're on a tight schedule today.
Tom doesn't have the qualities of a good teacher.
All you do is criticize others.
I think you and Tom have more in common than you want to admit.
You ought to have been more careful.
What time does the airport bus leave?
Tom was angry with Mary because she was in his parking space.
Tom was unfriendly to Mary.
Have you been told when to come?
There is little hope of success.
You should quit smoking.
I've asked you not to do that.
I think you'll have very little difficulty in getting a driver's license.
I have a lot of ideas.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
They were all friends.
Tom wants his children to learn French.
Tom and Mary held hands.
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
Mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
Would you wait a second?
The poor are getting poorer.
She accidentally tore the page.
That's a fact.
Who's your favorite movie villain?
It's Tom's birthday next week.
It's a basic human right.
Can I turn on the TV?
What is the most beautiful thing in the world?
I've eaten a great deal of food this week.
You knew I was married.
I'm going over to my sister's.
I just hope Tom is OK.
That street is very noisy.
He was the only one not invited to the party.
Drink some tea.
Pickpockets target tourists.
You're the only friend I have.
I worked as hard as I could so I didn't fail.
I didn't think this was your seat.
He's three years older than she is.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
When did you get married?
Sometimes, pictures can fool people.
I can't believe your mom made you wear that.
Tom's dad is cool.
I am a stranger here.
I'm in a better mood now.
That's a filthy job and I don't want to do it.
Many of the things Pizzaro had heard about the Inca treasure were true.
The bed was too hard.
Tom got out of the bathtub.
Who is the woman whose picture is on your desk?
Do you really think it's impossible?
Are you feeling under the weather?
I was afraid I wouldn't have the pleasure of meeting you.
I don't think you have a choice.
Did you think you were right?
In any case, I'll have to go there tomorrow.
Over 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles bombard the earth every day from space, most of which goes unnoticed.
Please call a taxi for me.
She tried to commit suicide.
Tom was wondering how he was supposed to get around without a car.
He is eager to become famous.
All our money is gone.
Stop by whenever you can.
I need to get out of here.
A railway bridge is already being built over the river.
Do you want some help?
Put the chair in front of the desk.
Are you going to buy a dictionary?
We bought Tom an expensive umbrella.
He made up that story.
Finish this.
We'll have lived here for two years next April.
We haven't been around that long.
Does the medicine act quickly?
Does Tom have green eyes?
Take your time.
I love all of you.
I'm going to buy a camera for my daughter.
The soldiers are wearing iron helmets.
I have to tell her that the phone rang while she was gone.
You've done the best you can do.
The sum of all the angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees.
You're in a restricted area.
How did you get so strong?
I thought you'd be proud of me.
He didn't hear his name called.
The last train has already gone.
She saw him at the station.
That's a tower.
I want to warn you.
She's not in the mood.
Theory and practice do not necessarily go together.
Tom is real cute.
You're disloyal.
You can look now.
Would you like it washed?
Tom was alone in his room.
I talked him out of the idea.
We love our dog.
He seldom writes to his father.
Take your umbrella with you.
It might prove useful.
This is unexpected.
A map is available upon request.
I feel ashamed that I got such bad marks in the examination.
Life is short.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
Why do I have to help you?
He is not at all foolish.
Why don't you stay there?
I'd accept.
Make yourselves comfortable.
They will keep their promise.
He hurt his knee when he fell.
I'm going back.
Can you tell the twins apart?
Dogs are like that.
No mountain in Japan is higher than Mt. Fuji.
What are you two staring at?
My only worry is that I have no worries.
You may stay here with me.
So, what's the problem?
The plane will get in on time.
I broke my right leg.
There were some boats on the lake.
Where's the oar?
I work in a flower shop.
Tom was lying in bed watching TV.
Do you think you can get me out of here?
How's your mother?
How's your father?
I don't remember her name anymore.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Tom gave me this apple.
It's regrettable.
He gave up his dream of becoming a pilot.
I couldn't speak.
Where were you born?
Get these people out of here.
They fell into the conversation immediately.
Tom won a large sum of money.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Are you going to buy that?
The manager called an urgent staff meeting.
I'm sure there's a connection.
I'd like to visit England someday.
Do you know when she will come?
They are very interested in astronomy.
Could you call me back later?
He almost got away with it.
The bottom 40% of the U.S. population has only 0.3% of the wealth.
I think Tom did the best he could.
I know my keys are here somewhere.
Have you ordered?
We can't be sure.
Some people believe in ghosts.
Tom is a Canadian who lives in Australia.
When does the performance begin?
Life doesn't always go the way we want it to.
I wasn't fast enough.
I'd like you to postpone your trip.
I love my life.
I didn't plan on staying.
How do I look tonight?
Don't think about stuff like that.
When does it begin?
Why didn't I think of that?

The death penalty should be abolished.
I wonder if Tom ever took Mary up on her offer.
Safety is what matters most.
Take care of yourself.
They never gave up.
Tom's dying.
When did you buy that?
She is very becoming in a black party dress.
You're driving too fast.
I have a broken wrist.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
I can hear you.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
I had intended to call Tom yesterday.
Tom isn't as old as I am.
You've lost a little weight, haven't you?
Tom is a decent sort of guy.
Tom is learning to swim.
I don't care who you are.
Do you like robots?
I have something I have to do.
I envy your good health.
You like olives, don't you?
She made tea for me.
She explained it over again.
Tom felt helpless and frightened.
You look good in a kimono.
Straighten up.
Strike while the iron is hot.
I'm going to be gone soon.
Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
Tom asked Mary to teach him how to play the ukulele.
Tom can ski just as well as Mary.
I finally gave up.
I am afraid to go.
Tom has many toys.
I don't feel tired at all.
I know your face.
Do you have a minute?
Everybody is great.
I like sushi.
I just don't remember.
You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
He filed a complaint.
Stand aside.
She took her ring off and threw it at him.
He's working at his English.
Do you know what they want?
Tom is the person we need.
Tom told Mary he had to leave early.
Doing that would be stupid.
You're a wonderful woman.
I won't allow you to date my sister.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Give me one good reason.
We finally did it.
Let's have lunch.
Tom and Mary look surprised.
They danced for hours.
I certainly would like a refund.
When did you start dating?
I should've taken that more seriously.
Tom was lucky that he didn't get killed.
What do you think?
I have no home to return to.
Don't touch anything without asking.
We have a good team.
Sorry to disturb you.
Get them out of my sight.
When did you say that?
I don't know how long we've got.
She advised him to be punctual.
We arrived first.
We all agreed unanimously.
I don't have a washing machine.
I'd like a nonstop flight to New York.
He tried to choke him.
I had the feeling you were going to ask me that.
He said the same thing over and over again.
We just want you to think about it.
I seem to have the wrong number.
You're overworked.
Thank you for helping me.
I became very sleepy after a bit of reading.
She has a very beautiful laugh.
Respect yourself.
The thermometer says it's thirty degrees in here.
We've no time.
The ice was thick enough for me to walk on.
That's my neighbor's dog.
Tom didn't know who Mary was at first.
This hat is mine.
She's dieting.
Let's not be fooled again.
Don't you get it? This isn't about you.
Are you through with the newspaper?
I haven't been back here since the incident.
I came across this book in a secondhand bookstore.
I wouldn't change a thing.
That's not what I was saying.
I don't understand why you're leaving.
That bus stops in front of my house.
I wish you'd stop saying that.
They're mad at you.
Have you finished talking?
Actions speak louder than words.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
I had trouble pronouncing his name.
I know that would make you happy.
It was frightening.
I bought you a present.
I hear you retired.
He asked me what I expected.
I might be able to arrange that.
Tom told me he was wounded.
Do you have health insurance?
I think we've met before.
This could take a while.
This is the third longest river in the world.
I don't think I can help you.
Barking dogs never bite.
I don't like homework.
We are worried about you.
Do you love me?
We bought a new washing machine.
I'm not a fool.
This is a stressful situation.
Please don't tell my wife.
Do you think I can pull this off?
Don't use slang if you can help it.
He fell asleep right away.
His car is similar to mine.
It's now 2:30.
Have we understood each other?
What's the reason?
I've got to go to another dreary meeting tomorrow.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
I couldn't bring myself to throw your picture away.
Keep away from the fire.
Tom said he would try.
I am certain that he will quit his job.
If the medicine isn't working, maybe we should up the dosage.
I have to study for tomorrow's French test.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
Tom handed an envelope to Mary.
His teeth were white.
He moved out of his parents' place.
She looked at the picture.
Why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
I threw a stone at the bird.
He's hungry and thirsty.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
I've eaten all the crackers.
I'm seeking a solution even now.
Cats are smarter than you think.
A truck hit the dog.
I had a light lunch.
You used to love swimming.
My grandfather sometimes talks to himself when he's alone.
I'm sober.
The cat ruined my sofa.
Don't talk!
He did what he promised to do for me.
He talked about music.
I'll give you to the count of three.
This is the very book you wanted.
Keep singing.
Life is full of confusing things.
The days grow shorter as winter approaches.
I know what you were hoping for.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
I'm a normal guy.
You're kind of cute when you're mad.
She asked him some questions.
She rents a room to a student.
He often goes to the library by car.
This guy is really hot.
They came up with a plan after a long discussion.
He looks older than my brother.
You smell awful.
I don't really care how you do it.
The temperature has been below zero for many days now.
That sounds interesting.
Please take a seat.
Go away before they see you here.
We'll pick Tom up on the way.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
Tom is waiting for you in his office.
Is she your mother?
Please tell me what you think about this article.
We have snow in January.
I suppose I'd better be more careful the next time.
I hope your parents like me.
Three of these are mine.
All of a sudden, large drops of rain began falling from the dark sky.
They're all mine.
If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
Did Tom call while I was out?
These aren't my keys.
Tom placed the dishtowel over his shoulder.
Everybody loves him.
You're very understanding.
Tom only had a few visitors when he was in the hospital.
He has a butler and a cook.
That was mentioned.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
The clock stopped.
I expect him to get over the shock of his failure.
The man who is standing over there is my father.
This job involves lots of hard work.
Why did you come home so late?
Feel this.
It was pitch black outside.
Do you have a shoehorn?
I can't hear you very well.
She dreamed that a prince would come on a white horse to take her away.
Did you notice that Tom wasn't wearing his wedding ring today?
Did you hear what I said?
I'll examine it for myself.
They ruined it.
She shrieked.
Do I have to go?
Perhaps you would have preferred a French dish.
I can teach you how to sing.
Why were you absent yesterday?
He's likely to be late.
After much consideration, we accepted his offer.
Lunch will be ready soon.
Tom has three brothers.
I was half expecting this to happen.
When will you arrive?
Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything.
His carelessness resulted in the accident.
The world seems to get smaller.
Can you open the window?
Do you think I care what you think of me?
Is it true that you gamble?
She got up late.
We're on the right floor.
There's a big hole in your sock.
He's down to earth.
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
What time does the first train leave?
I don't know anything about him.
Tom restrained himself from hitting Mary.
The meeting was all but over.
I'm wet.
We should try to understand one another.
I thought you'd ask about that.
I want you to help me choose a book.
My pen is old. I want a new one.
My uncle gave him a present.
How's Tom doing?
I paid $200 in taxes.
I'll fix a drink.
Come whenever you like.
I have no children.
We saw an interesting program on television yesterday.
You and I are going together.
They're washing their hands.
I thought maybe I'd better not clean my room.
Anything is infinitely better than nothing.
I'd like to give it to Tom.
I've had enough of your lying.
Let me push the button.
When did you take this picture?
That speech lost Tom the election.
I was impressed with her work.
Let's presume you're right.
I haven't read both of his novels.
Are you having fun?
This man is incompetent.
All who knew him admired him.
They were not impressed.
I hope I can hold on to my job.
Be prepared.
We could've done this without your help.
I was fired in 2013.
I let go of the rope.
It's a pity that you couldn't come.
All you can do is trust one another.
That's barbaric!
I found him a job.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
I only eat vegetables that I grow myself.
We're still underage.
I've heard that some people sleep in bathtubs.
Are you making fun of me?
Tom took his new car out for a spin.
We like Tom.
We have a meeting.
How do you know how thick it is?
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
What's the best Christmas present you've ever gotten?
Have you gone nuts?
I'm unconvinced.
We speak English in class.
Do you have a place to stay tonight?
The bird is dead.
The doctor gave me a shot.
What do you think of his new novel?
It's been a long time since I've written anything.
I run a small business.
He is Japanese.
We must go.
Can I talk to you about your son?
I eat there every night.
We're shocked.
Tom was asked to be best man at Mary's brother's wedding.
We have to do better next time.
She's in a bad mood.
She didn't want him to die.
I'm thankful for my children.
It's just an expression.
Does anyone feel sick?
It is a payday today.
This is a new kind of melon.
How does this work?
I just cut my finger.
I live in a relatively safe neighborhood.
By the way, do you play the violin?
A number of cars are parked in front of my house.
I want to fight.
It's too noisy in here.
I don't want to watch television this evening.
I never learned how to write.
I kept singing.
I hate this carpet.
I am Finnish, but I speak also Swedish.
The meeting took place yesterday.
We can be certain of that.
I can't believe you fell for that.
Where exactly should I put this?
I found a pair of gloves under the chair.
I am happy to hear your voice.
She wants to keep him at a distance.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
I immediately started crying.
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
Please don't go home.
I like the way you look.
I knew you liked me even though you never showed it.
I bared my soul to her.
I didn't move.
Tom has just come back from vacation.
Tom was ambitious.
The rooms in this hotel are pretty basic.
You're no saint.
How many do you see now?
I don't know many French songs.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
I told you this would happen.
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
He danced all night long.
Does it hurt?
I don't wash my hair in the morning.
I addressed the envelope containing the invitation.
They say that I'm an old woman.
She's fixing the machine.
I was badly wounded.
May I go out for a walk?
Learning foreign languages is boring.
Today's special is fish.
I can't tolerate Tom's behavior.
I just thought you were happy.
I'm stuck in Boston.
We talked about it all night.
Nobody does it better.
I don't know what I was expecting.
Tickets are valid for just two days, including the day they are purchased on.
Where did you put the screwdriver?
I'm fond of listening to classical music.
Music is my passion.
In autumn, the moon is really beautiful.
That's really important.
Tom takes care of our kids.
Tom said he shot Mary in self-defense.
We have no choice but to go.
We're married now.
I wasn't serious.
I think you may as well tell me.
Movie theaters are losing more and more revenue due to internet piracy.
I'm not ashamed of my father being poor.
I like hiking in the mountains.
Tom is reckless.
Can I sit on your lap?
It's high time you were in bed.
There were too many children in the pool.
I'm considering resigning.
I turned off the lamp and went to sleep.
Shouldn't you go home?
You need to be more patient.
Are you satisfied or dissatisfied?
He decided not to go.
It looks really good.
You're very timid.
I hope we will be able to keep in touch.
I want another cup of coffee.
That doesn't add up.
He moved back with his parents.
He is just my age.
I fed the pigs.
Maybe it's not as hard as it looks.
I studied before supper.
A fish swims by moving its tail.
What color is this?
He has a common name.
I know your feelings are hurt.
I'm calling to tell you what I need.
He has two beautiful boys.
You've gotta be kidding!
I hate jealous women.
I've got no quarrel with you two.
Can you pass me the salt, please?
They each received a present.
Twenty people died in a fire.
I want a lot.
She introduced me to her father.
My waist size has recently increased. I guess it's middle-age spread.
It's really not that interesting.
Just put it there.
Just do as I say.
You must think I'm really strange.
How tall you are!
That's a very difficult question.
She is behind in her rent.
I feel like I could cry.
Do you have any small change?
Do you think Tom killed himself?
Why did you do this to me?
Do you want your coat back?
Move up to the front, please.
I will take it.
This is the monsoon season.
Are you ready to do that?
He had been working in the factory for three years when the accident occurred.
I did the job to the best of my ability.
I suggest trying to get some sleep.
Tom has a lot of valuable books.
If you're happy, I'm glad.
Tom never apologized.
You look Japanese.
That remains to be seen.
He is not strong as before.
What would I do if something happened to you?
Tom hasn't told me anything.
I want to be in a rock band.
You're the leader.
The man you met at the station is my father.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Tom put his pistol under the pillow.
The wind gradually died down.
I've got a touch of the flu.
Tom is the strongest.
That's not entirely true.
Tom told Mary to keep that a secret.
That's a trivial error.
When Tom opened the door, he saw Mary standing there with a six-pack and a pizza.
What have you done to yourself?
I don't want us to look foolish.
We were forced to work hard.
He's here to protect you.
Tom said he had a great time with you.
I felt naked.
Shape up or ship out!
Are they coming, too?
We're persevering.
I am going to stay here for a couple of days.
Go with the flow.
I want to be more independent.
Where does this piece go?
They were very confused.
This fashion has had its day.
You are late.
He is not altogether wrong.
Let's move the bed.
Tom probably doesn't know what Mary hopes he does.
Everything is on the house.
Please replace the empty printer cartridge.
He said nothing.
You're wiser than you know.
He will be waiting for you.
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.
I'm calling because I've lost my credit card.
I told Tom he should save a little money each month.
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
Stop bothering me!
I'm sure Tom was involved.
Try to go slower.
I was horrified.
We need a knife for the butter.
Don't be so impatient.
I'll miss you very much if you go.
Camels are often used to travel in the desert.
Don't speak so fast, please.
We're all dying.
You're cruel.
He was very fun.
Do you think there's a connection?
It's yours if you want it.
I guess that will have to do.
Tom got on the airplane.
The crowd poured out of the auditorium.
I ended up winning.
I don't want to eat with Tom.
Who painted this picture?
After that, he went home.
He seems to have been ill.
You've given me good advice.
Thanks for saving me.
Violence increased soon afterward.
All this has changed.
We want you to take it.
Aren't you glad you didn't go to Boston?
I'm pretty certain that won't happen.
The rainy season begins towards the end of June.
It's not a pyramid scheme.
She attempted to kill herself.
I think you should grow a beard.
Thanks for helping out.
We will win the battle.
It could've been worse.
You forgot to close the windows before you left the office last Friday.
Mine is totally different.
I wonder if Tom is still eating lunch.
There's nothing better than a delicious meal.
It rained yesterday, but it cleared up this morning.
I don't have enough RAM.
Is this your first trip abroad?
I have no idea what you mean.
You're really in bad shape.
Are you on the committee?
Do it again!
I don't expect you to forgive me.
I need you right now.
Please don't go home.
I guess that she is over thirty.
When you leave the room, please make sure you turn off the lights.
The weather is very cold in Istanbul.
Twenty years already passed.
I'm your friend.
I want to find out who broke the window.
I had him write it.
Who are you going to vote for?
Should I call you or will you call me?
Tom dumped Mary.
You can't do both at the same time.
You won't catch anything.
I'd like to open an account.
I can't believe you actually said that.
She became a doctor.
Thank you for your letter.
Where did you go for spring break?
I want for you and me to be happy.
The Ferris wheel is my favorite.
Please write with a pen.
I have a lot of assignments to do today.
You're missing the point.
If you pass this test, you could graduate next month.
Are there any cute boys in your class?
I was completely shocked.
The students snickered.
Wanna go upstairs and have a drink?
I think I forgot to lock the door.
Why didn't we think of that before?
Tom doesn't want you to share this information with anyone.
Just wait a second.
He is in trouble now.
It wasn't me who started the fight.
He has never been scolded by his father.
There's a catch.
You may come in now.
I'm sick of this place.
I'll take a rain check on that.
The castle is on the other side of the river.
Get up.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
You didn't get very far.
You're embarrassing me.
Who's the next person on your list?
They're just students.
I'm aware of my responsibilities.
There is a threat of a storm.
You weren't even there.
I hope that's satisfactory.
Write me.
I think you've been very immature.
I prefer to go alone.
I only drink water.
We must water the flower.
Some people talk too much and do too little.
Have you gone completely insane?
He is very much interested in Japanese history.
He let the dog loose in the garden.
All my plants died.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
Tom actually figured it out by himself.
I'm here all the time.
Be still.
I almost drowned.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
That's what's making me sick.
It's not a weapon.
How's the project going?
It wasn't until I heard him speak that I recognized him.
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
My school grades have been average.
Tom doesn't seem to have any self-confidence.
He found the box under the table.
I don't like this hat.
I could've done that by myself.
I want to play the guitar.
Do you like the corsage?
How much do you know about artificial intelligence?
Let me know what you're up to.
My grandfather made the company what it is today.
They're expensive.
You're not usually like this.
It's not far to Boston.
Do you know how to get to our place?
I'm not intimidated.
You're courteous.
Nobody remembers.
He reads French and German, not to speak of English.
He divorced his wife last month.
I have no food.
We want more money.
Is there someone with you?
Why don't you sit here a moment?
I eagerly await your decision.
That's what I always say.
Aren't you annoyed by that?
They each received a present.
Are you frightened?
Lying to Tom was a mistake.
I stopped smoking and drinking.
Did they say how?
Did he tell you what to do?
Is it safe?
I'm horrible with kids.
Is it dangerous?
How was your trip to Australia?
I have no idea how long it'll take.
Both girls laughed.
Nobody can stop us from doing that.
They did it in front of the staff.
Strive to be happy.
You elect your representative by voting.
Several students in the back of the classroom were sleeping.
Tom lost his ticket.
She cried bitterly.
He will pay for everything.
Will you join us?
I come here as often as I can.
Tom came yesterday.
It's brand new.
My father owns a small business in Fukuoka.
They finished building the bridge on time.
I can't let you go in there alone.
I wanted to make a good first impression.
Quit complaining.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
She has three children.
She smiled and accepted my little present.
They'll be so happy to have Tom back.
What's going to happen that's so terrible?
You are so childish sometimes.
What happened on the bus?
He used to smoke, but now he doesn't.
Did Tom fight?
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
He was able to read the book.
I have a schedule.
The day started very well.
Tom sometimes comes to see me.
I thought it might be nice for us to spend some time together.
Will you join our club?
She can drive a car.
Tom never gave up.
It was not an accident.
She lives in this neighborhood.
I want you to go to the doctor.
Is there any other way I can pay you?
Tom stamped his foot three times.
I remember when I first saw you.
I have to leave now.
Let's hurry.
As it is, I can do nothing.
The price includes tax.
One of us could help you.
I arrived too late.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
Can you watch the kids?
I've enjoyed talking to you.
My father is proud of the fact that he's never been in a traffic accident.
Will she come home at five?
I have toothache.
She has an eye for beauty.
Old people deserve respect.
I learned French in Paris.
This is all a misunderstanding.
I understand Tom's frustration.
Tom acted like he was drunk.
Can anything ever be the same again?
I've found it.
I was trying to tell him what had really happened, but he cut me short.
What's your favorite French word?
Could you tell me where I can get a subway?
I'm interfering.
I don't like who you've become.
I just didn't want to be there.
He began running.
Is there a message?
I slept all day yesterday, because it was Sunday.
The victim is thought to have taken a large quantity of poison by mistake.
I know where he lives.
We are overfishing the world's oceans.
They don't talk at all.
This is a portrait of my late father.
Our dreams came true.
They even named their boy after you.
I thought you were asleep.
I always drive at a moderate speed.
I think Tom eats too much meat.
I'm just telling you what I heard.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
That's great!
I work every day but Sunday.
How old were you when your family moved to Boston?
Cut off the power.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
I can't lend this book to you.
You've underestimated Tom.
I'm adaptable.
Have you said anything about this to Tom?
Tom has done that only once.
Eating too much may lead to sickness.
Let's hope Tom doesn't try to do that without some help.
I remember seeing this before.
This is how I learned English.
You should follow your teacher's advice.
He was fully clothed.
What's the climate there like?
The number of fish in the ocean is steadily declining.
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV.
Stop acting like a child.
Your dreams will come true.
Do you think I can pull this off?
She sat next him with her eyes closed.
He takes the attitude that resistance is a waste of energy.
I forgot your phone number.
I slammed the door shut.
I believe Tom can do that.
I'll bring you something to eat.
It is ten minutes to eleven.
You're a menace.
Do you know this lady?
We were there.
Don't go in there.
What did you buy?
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
I just had to check on something.
Will you guys please stop fighting?
He tried to unify the various groups.
The provisions ran out after a short time.
Why did you buy flowers?
She deliberately exposed him to danger.
Would you like another glass of water?
I had nowhere else to go.
I need to talk to you about this.
She guessed right.
We're in charge.
The moonlight reflected on the lake.
I think Tom wants something to write with.
Let's get some food.
It's mean of you to talk that way.
I asked him to leave at once.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for your health.
Do I annoy you?
Stir the paint with a stick.
I could feel the sweat trickling down my back.
I got off at the wrong station.
I can hear nothing.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
It can be used as a knife.
We must inform them.
It's a matter of survival.
Mother has not cooked dinner yet.
We'll have a lot of fun.
That's a bright idea.
Could you lower your voice please? I'm really hung over.
Where do you get off telling me that?
I'll find some way to do this.
You get paid in proportion to the amount of the work you do.
When are you coming to Melbourne again?
Don't you have a sense of justice?
Let's meet up for a drink later.
Don't you think it a bad thing?
I didn't know you were still here.
When I was a child, I was always drinking milk.
I went to the scene of the crime.
I'd like to hear a lot more about your trip.
My father would never allow me to go out with someone like you.
The kindergarten children were walking hand in hand in the park.
I want to take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the governor.
He grew up in a small town.
Where did you put the book I was reading?
Our uncle bought us movie tickets.
He had a second helping of soup.
You're resourceful.
They won't tell you the truth.
I hope I can rely on you.
I feel like I might throw up.
I already took care of it.
Put on your pajamas and go to bed.
You'll give me away.
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
I don't even know you.
I need to get some air.
She was not interested in boys at all.
Let's talk about what you did in Boston.
I'm in luck.
I look forward to it.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
You're not as smart as me.
What are you crying for?
She's a very interesting person.
What is the temperature?
Let me handle this.
The man aimed a gun at the policeman.
Do you want some help?
What are they going to do?
What's the first thing you're going to do?
I want to get Tom something nice for his birthday.
I don't really know what this means.
My mother prepared me for the bad news.
Who is your favorite author?
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
Will you give me some time?
I want to take you to dinner.
I think that's better.
I hope this can help someone.
Photography is an expensive hobby.
I was confident.
I smell something rotten.
The boy hid behind the door.
Shoes are sold in pairs.
He's incredibly talented.
We're going to work together.
I wasn't too sure about it.
The bathroom's on the left.
I should've gotten a ticket.
She abandoned her sons.
Do slugs die if you pour salt on them?
I can feel it.
The President is to speak on television this evening.
This beach is dangerous at night.
It was all wrong.
I just felt a drop of rain.
His house was sold for ten thousand dollars.
I don't know when, but it'll happen someday.
Where is his family?
There's no way to win.
I wanted you to have this.
I'm not sure that that's true.
I knew who did it.
Did they hurt you?
Iran is the eighteenth largest country in the world.
Where can we eat lunch?
Does an electric wheelchair require a driver's license?
I think it must've been Tom who broke the window.
I was happy for him.
The air conditioner is out of order.
You should try it.
I never thought I'd find a woman like you.
He is a student.
Tom felt someone touch his arm.
I found the subject fascinating.
Lost in thought, I missed my stop.
Tom asked me to be here.
He picked up the phone.
How can you be so callous?
Is he still here?
Lead the way.
The young girl lost her bracelet.
This is cool.
Do you need a ride?
I just found it.
That's a photo of my sister.
We're still underage.
All the guys teased me about it.
Tom looked at the painting on the wall.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
Let's clean this up.
Let's get this party started!
He was deprived of his civil rights.
I can't remember what this is called.
I didn't get the meaning.
I feel lonely when you're not here.
That was a close one.
Would you like me to open the window?
Maybe I went a little too far.
Did it really take three hours to do that?
Do you understand what's going on?
The truth finally came out at his trial.
We're Canadians.
I haven't told the kids yet that we're getting divorced.
You're alone, aren't you?
I know I'm not perfect.
Tom is a teacher like me.
Tom isn't qualified to teach high school.
I'm observant.
Normally, I'm not afraid of planes.
I found these.
You can tell what a person is like by looking at his friends.
I opened one eye.
I've got a splendid idea.
I'm sure you don't want to do that.
What do I have to be afraid of?
I shouldn't complain.
How do I apply for a visa?
That's what we were told.
I thought I told you to cut your hair.
He should have worked harder.
How do I thank you?
Tom doesn't look troubled at all.
We're looking for a volunteer.
The doctor warned him of the dangers of smoking.
That's rather amusing.
I want to walk.
You have good taste in music.
Tom knows it was a mistake.
She added, as an afterthought, that she was going to do some shopping.
Tom doesn't like being told what to do.
They stopped talking.
Tom told me that wasn't true.
This isn't possible.
Face facts!
We all die.
I hope you'll come back.
Any chance of us getting approved?
I hope all your dreams come true.
Who was the man you were talking to?
You don't smell good at all.
Don't thank me. Thank Tom.
How do you know they're looking for us?
You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
I want to help.
I can speak Chinese, but I can't read it.
I thought you might like some hot coffee.
I was asleep.
He attends the same school that I do.
The children returned home at dusk.
The Greens are against everything.
My friend is a talkative person.
Don't admit anything.
It's a beautiful night for a swim, don't you think?
Do you really want to do this?
We're not married.
Everyone likes you.
Do you believe him?
I have to go.
I think we should leave now.
He drank a cup of coffee.
He gave away all his money to charity.
As far as I know, he did nothing wrong.
I had no other choice but to do it.
Stay here all night if you want.
Who are they talking to?
I still make mistakes.
I got fined.
He was paralyzed with terror.
Tom has chosen you.
I have a hunch that it will rain.
I had to help with the housework.
Don't confuse Austria with Australia.
Are you a registered voter?
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
Nobody saw it coming.
I haven't seen you for a while.
Is this really what you want to do?
That made Tom pretty mad.
I hate celery.
We solved that problem in a week.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
I should've studied French more seriously when I was in high school.
They chased others away.
What is it you have in mind?
Who knows what could happen?
I want to join your group.
His cottage is on the coast.
The police told the demonstrators that they'd be arrested if they didn't move immediately.
Are you open on Saturday?
I like my life the way it is now.
I'm going to take this.
We won't have time to do that today.
My idea is different from yours.
I want you to take this with you.
Have you seen my new car?
I truly didn't know you felt this way.
He takes after his father.
When should I feed my dog?
Your birthday is coming soon.
I don't think about you.
Can you still remember the time we first met?
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
A heavy frost is expected.
This is a coincidence.
Tom is playing the violin now.
She sued him for damages.
We took a walk along the riverbank.
This is the village where I spent my childhood.
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
The more I think about it, the less I understand it.
He fought until the end.
Tom knows this is the truth.
Tom waited patiently for three hours, then left.
Is this a challenge?
Don't make me laugh!
You're not good at this.
It's quite safe.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
Are you sure you don't want one?
I can't believe you just did that.
No matter how rich you are, you can't buy true love.
That's really scary.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
He drives his own car.
We're not certain of that yet.
You get out only what you put in.
There's no way out.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Tom didn't survive the accident.
Tom asked Mary for some help.
You don't have to go to the party if you don't want to.
I think Tom is wrong.
They're dangerous.
Why didn't you call me up?
I'm going to start with this one.
I think it's time for me to move into a smaller home.
Riding a horse is a lot of fun.
He drank beer.
Let's see if they let you talk.
I think you might have a drinking problem.
It may not be a good idea to eat while you are running.
Will you pass me the salt, please?
I think it's worth asking.
We have ponchos.
We can build that.
Tom will be there.
What are some foods you usually eat with soy sauce?
Do you like Mozart's music?
All the kids at school made fun of me because I was fat.
I am glad to help you.
It's a fake one, right?
What's not to like?
How do they seem to you?
I'm not done with you.
Mine is the red one.
All I found is a pair of scissors.
I'm going to miss you a lot.
You didn't come to school yesterday, did you?
We understand.
They are doctors.
Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to pay that bill today.
He uncorked the bottle.
Can you make it safe?
I keep a rabbit as a pet.
Can I write it like that?
They found each other.
I want to catch the 11:45.
The address on this parcel is wrong.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
That soon changed.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
What is the emergency telephone number?
I saw him there.
I thought it would be easy to do.
I'm a beginner, too.
She found confrontations very upsetting.
I love you both.
This is pretty.
If I had enough money, I could go abroad.
I like your hair.
I can't allow you to do that.
Don't you know what it is?
Tom doesn't drive as carefully as I do.
He let me work in this office.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
My time is very expensive.
I need you to come with me.
Has Tom eaten anything?
My hands were shaking too much to thread the needle.
He exchanged yen for dollars.
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
How'd it work out?
I've always liked your hair that way.
I'd like to go with you.
I don't have any objection to that.
I love that dress.
Tom should be here within fifteen minutes.
They said they were leaving.
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
I arrived in Boston yesterday.
How do I know you didn't do it?
I don't know what your problem is.
No one is going to hurt you.
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
Tom hasn't bought his ticket yet.
We have to do this the right way.
The sky was gray.
I'm sort of tired.
I admire your dedication.
I can't go to the mall.
Tom told Mary he was busy.
Deal me out.
I'm going to explain all this in more detail later.
Stop treating me like a child.
I was born on April 3, 1950.
They did what they were told.
The weather turned better.
I wanted to show you this.
If you want to stay, you can stay.
Happy Valentine's Day.
She ran as fast as she was able to.
The troops advanced twenty miles.
I don't know whether you're happy or not.
There's no guard.
Why are you so insecure?
I broke a glass when I did the dishes.
Should we call an ambulance?
That's why I'm here.
It is raining hard.
It's for you to decide.
She didn't tell me the truth.
I beg you.
Who volunteered?
Did you see anyone on the beach?
He learned how to raise cattle.
Do you feel birthdays are important?
The exhibition was very impressive.
Would you let me think about it for a while?
His car was seriously damaged.
We must focus.
I told them everything.
I'll show you the way out.
I don't know which to choose.
Can you wrap these neatly for me?
I want this dog.
I don't want to know what you did yesterday.
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
I'm thinking.
Don't forget to send the letter.
He received rough treatment.
The airplane took off on time.
No one told me anything.
Visit us tomorrow.
My favorite sport is skiing.
Nice timing.
Did you buy these for me?
Have you found an answer to this question?
Your father seems very nice.
I was glad that I could help.
No one's working.
Just leave me alone.
His car soon went out of sight.
Wait till six.
Are you real sure about that?
Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
I liked your friends.
He made a joke about it.
Do you still need a loan?
I saw them.
I'll get it.
Do you really believe I did that?
I don't remember when this photo was taken.
I'm not a violent person.
You're the oldest.
Many people are suffering from hunger around the world.
That's all you can do.
It's a full moon.
May I be excused for a minute?
He didn't participate in the discussion.
I can't stand that guy.
Mary took her necklace off.
It looks like we're running out of money.
You can't leave me hanging.
Are you going to vote today?
My cousin isn't the kind of person who'd ever break a promise.
I don't feel sorry for you.
I would beg to differ.
It's just money.
Who's your favorite lyricist?
It would be better if you didn't drink so much coffee late at night.
I can't believe you lied to me.
Your phone's ringing.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
She denied having been asked to go on a business trip.
Did we forget anything?
Mine is better than yours.
I thought it might be you.
I'm sloshed.
Atoms cannot be seen with your own eye.
What's in front of you?
I haven't got a chance.
We are out of danger.
You can go to the station by bus.
You're crafty.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
Life is short.
You've got to be bold!
I enjoyed talking to him.
That should be enough for now.
I'll join you in a moment.
I've had a lot on my mind lately.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
He's the king's most trusted advisor.
They're lying.
Hitler led Germany into war.
We're ready.
You had a choice.
Nobody must know.
I left the door unlocked.
Can I borrow this for a while?
As soon as I got home, the telephone rang.
He is blind in one eye.
They're part of us.
Maybe we should start.
Who invited you to the party?
He has a lot of poise.
Just take a deep breath.
Have you seen Tom's latest invention?
I didn't see him.
A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide pollution that we produce as a result of our activities. Some people try to reduce their carbon footprint because they are concerned about climate change.
I love bananas.
Tom started shooting.
Have you seen this man?
The stars are shining in the sky.
I can talk to him for hours.
He took a photograph of the family.
Tom ate a hamburger with fries.
I had to get everyone's attention.
I wish you good luck.
Tom is in need of a vacation.
Where shall we have breakfast today?
Tom's boat was stolen.
They all looked happy.
Which one of us do you like best?
I don't want you to spend money on me.
You came too late.
We have a lot of snow at this time of the year.
Am I disturbing you?
Your computer will restart several times during installation.
Am I supposed to thank you?
I've been waiting for you for three hours!
I closed the door so that they wouldn't hear us.
You did this.
Do you need to drink wine?
Do you want to become a father?
It's a conspiracy.
The astronaut had to conduct many experiments in the space shuttle.
Look at this mess.
What were you two talking about?
You are seriously ill.
Do you have any kind of alibi?
That's a banana.
Many of these are Tom's.
They braved the snow storm.
I'll play along.
Could you please hurry?
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
No students went there yesterday.
He felt utterly humiliated.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I said I liked it.
The police have been searching for the stolen goods for almost a month.
No one is home.
I'd do my homework now if I were you.
Tom nodded.
I'll be careful never to be late again.
Tom and Mary can both speak French.
I see that dog almost every day.
That was pretty weird.
I hate to do this.
I have a small favor to ask of you.
They formed a swim team.
I'm not talking to you, Tom.
I hope you won't leave me here.
Suddenly, it became noisy.
Yours was better.
My sister got married in her teens.
He stood by himself.
He removed his shirt.
Is it OK to drink alcoholic drinks in this park?
What're your plans for the weekend?
Tom is really fast, isn't he?
Are you ready to work?
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing.
I'm just a regular office worker.
Do you want some help?
You won't need those.
That can happen sometimes.
I had some cash stashed away.
She was advised by him to listen to her doctor.
Tom is trying not to worry too much.
Tom was sitting by the window.
I want to see him no matter what.
I want to talk to you about this report.
You are free to go.
Can someone open a window?
I'm sure I can find something for you to wear.
Take care of your health.
How many times do I have to say that?
Few people live to be 100 years old.
I do not know anything about him.
Can I have your telephone number?
We saw a stranger walking outside.
If it rains tomorrow, the excursion will be canceled.
It's for your own safety.
We're eating breakfast indoors.
I am talking to my sister.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
I quickly ate lunch.
Let me give you a little tip.
Is anybody home?
Please hand in the necessary papers.
Tom seems jealous.
Whoever gets home first starts cooking the supper.
I tried to tell you.
We'll decide later.
The old man has lived here all his life.
Do you not know who I am?
I want to go back to doing what I was doing before you interrupted me.
He found it.
You're the only person I know who is qualified for this job.
I can't help.
The tall man looked at Tom and smiled.
We bought some tennis balls.
As soon as I can get my son to scan our family photos, I'll upload some of them to our website.
It's been five years since we moved here.
She didn't give me back my money.
The fish smells bad.
The workers were naked to the waist.
Industrialization had a great influence on the development of the economy in Japan.
She must go there.
They go to work on foot.
He ran up the stairs breathing very hard.
I can't go to work today.
Is mercury really a metal?
You have more energy than I do.
I should've been with you.
How many students have been admitted to the school this year?
I was too busy to write you.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
I can't do it justice.
They were swimming.
Why do you need to do that?
I like beer.
Just a moment ...
Who cares?
Could you do this instead of me? "Sorry, I'm too busy."
Did you watch the game on Monday?
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
He did not put up his hand.
What's your nationality?
She's at the hotel now.
Fasten your seat belts.
You're the owners.
I'm in luck.
Did you paint this?
Let me be the judge of that.
As far as I know, he's guilty.
Are you still jealous?
She pleaded with him to stay.
People are playing near the beach.
We're enemies.
Tom lives and works in Boston.
I banged my leg on the coffee table.
Who says that?
If I were you, I would paint it blue.
He was busy copying his friend's notebook.
Huge numbers of soldiers and civilians were killed.
Don't you think that Tom was a little weird?
Does your wife know?
I will give you a call as soon as I get home.
I really appreciate your coming.
Where ever did you buy it?
Is there a problem with your hearing?
I am constantly forgetting people's names.
I can't agree with you on this matter.
I've said everything I was planning to say.
The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know.
I need another one.
We must protect the children.
They made fun of my clothes.
What did you have to do?
I worked all this week.
Tom ran outside half-naked.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't have a brother.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
We think it's a good idea.
He asked me to pass him the salt.
Are you allergic to any medicine?
Tom is a real-estate developer.
Stop it. You're making me blush.
He is actually not the manager.
You're not supposed to be here.
When were you born?
Are you sure you have the right address?
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was younger.
Why don't you start?
I prefer to remain seated.
I did it the way he told me to.
This is so frustrating.
I have lived here a long time.
Where's my ring?
I have a lawyer.
Don't tell me.
This dress suits you well.
Do you think this rope is strong enough?
Doing homework is extremely boring.
Tie your shoelaces.
It all changed.
Next Wednesday will be fine.
My mother makes cakes.
I'm too busy to help him.
She's waiting for you at home.
I know a better way to do that.
Our team lost.
Do you really want to stay young forever?
I take it for granted that people are honest.
She loves him now more than she did before.
I'm your doctor.
Trees do not grow on prairies.
Where did you get the idea?
Do me a favor and shut up.
He told a funny story.
If I've misjudged you, I'm terribly sorry.
He never saw his brother again.
Tom only wears brand-name clothes.
She has always been a popular actress.
I want to write all of this down.
He visited a friend.
Many Americans protested the purchase of Alaska.
Hold on a minute.
You're young and strong.
I thought that he knew everything about Japan.
Tom, Mary and John were each given three hundred dollars.
Please hold the line a moment.
Not knowing what to do, he asked me for help.
Her name often escapes me.
I'm calling from my cell phone.
The air is thin at the top of a high mountain.
We're fine.
Tom doesn't take criticism well.
I think that went really well.
I didn't change a thing.
I think of you as a friend.
Don't you watch old movies?
I shouldn't have done this.
Shut that boy up.
I don't even know if Tom is still alive.
A white car has been tailing me for the last two miles.
She told me she loved me.
I love you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
I can't stand his behavior anymore.
I prefer it this way.
Tom stole Mary's watch.
I'm firing you.
They're all against me.
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
It's not for everybody.
My wife is a lawyer.
Dad gave me a computer game.
We tried our best.
They are looking for a house to live in.
I don't think you really want to know.
He remembered that Room 418, a very small room, was empty.
He denied everything.
She removed the dishes from the table.
I don't want to leave Boston.
It was only yesterday that I realized what she really meant.
I'd like to be with Tom.
It would be better for you to stay away from such a man.
I hope you're right.
They knew they must fight together to defeat the common enemy.
I'm grateful.
Bad teeth often cause pain.
He drinks too much alcohol.
This bird can't fly.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
I go to school.
I can still hear you.
Tom drinks too much.
You're fortunate.
Is that what you were talking about last night?
I don't think Tom likes to ski.
I fell in love with someone my parents didn't like.
I was saving this piece of cake for you.
I think it was unfair.
I put cream in my coffee.
This is a rather unusual request.
It's on its way.
All you do is criticize others.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
It may well rain before tonight.
It's not a date.
You've won the lottery.
I'm not making any plans.
They don't work at night.
Do we have to do this now?
I do feel pretty good.
Tom was a brave soldier.
I know you're not serious.
You don't need to wait.
I've never cared about such things.
You're impressed, aren't you?
Didn't anyone question you?
You're overqualified for this job.
If you leave right now, you'll be in time for the plane for sure.
I cut the rope.
The man robbed him of all his money.
I love gardening.
I like your T-shirt.
Tom hasn't had an easy life.
It's only temporary.
He went by bicycle.
We were made for each other.
What sports do you like?
Please stop calling me that.
Tom didn't sleep all night.
My aunt looks young.
I could be wrong, but I think Tom likes you.
I know that Tom is depressed.
I don't understand a word of what he says.
He died of a heart attack on the stage.
Tom waved his arms.
I learn French at school.
Who invited you to the party?
Apparently, the bus is late.
I recommend it highly.
It's just a dream.
I've been drinking.
I'm nervous and excited.
I seldom listen to the radio.
I eat here every day.
That is actually what I wanted.
Tom said he's tired of eating Chinese food.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
Can I ask you a quick question?
I'm beginning to understand why Tom loves Boston.
I recently had surgery.
We hardly ever see you around here anymore.
Maybe you should have a little talk with Tom.
My dog is dreaming of a cat.
I really am interested.
You don't have to apologize.
I can speak French a little.
Is there anything you want that you don't have?
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
Tom hid under the table.
What does that even mean?
We'll discuss it later.
Will you show me the picture?
I'm not jealous.
It's no use complaining.
How would you like it if I hit you?
Tom is in his office, working.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
You're very intelligent.
You can't buy this medicine without a prescription.
We danced to the music for hours until we were all exhausted.
I usually don't work here.
For me, it's important.
When spring comes, they dig up the fields and plant seeds.
She always wears fashionable clothes.
There's a double standard.
I want you to tell the truth.
Please continue until I tell you to stop.
We owe three years worth of taxes.
Today's your birthday, isn't it?
I think they like us.
You drank a beer at lunch, didn't you?
Tom turned on the lamp.
I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that.
Are you content with your position in the company?
I'm buying.
She was blackmailed by him.
A fuse has blown.
The policeman was confronted by the angry mob.
You're a teacher, right?
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
Why are you out of breath?
You were afraid, weren't you?
I know she is sleeping.
Tom likes watching TV.
Do you want a cab?
It wasn't that big.
It is worthwhile to read this book.
He has small feet.
We were told by him to leave the room at once.
I hope we didn't wake you.
This isn't what I wanted.
Have you paid the rent?
I can't stop watching.
He often calls her names.
Do I have to change my diet?
I had no clue.
He likes me.
I have not been studying for two days.
You had a week to finish this.
They'll know what to do.
You don't have to do what Tom says.
We buy a lot of things from them.
There were three coffee mugs on the table.
Is that your cat?
Tom put his shoes on the shoe rack.
I put the money into the safe.
Tom became a doctor.
I've never cared about such things.
Are you ready for today's game?
I'm sick and tired of all this bickering.
Tom was a fanatic.
He drinks himself unconscious every night.
She suffers from a contagious disease.
I want to drink some water.
I can't change who I am.
I know that money isn't everything.
That's what you're good at.
The park is in the center of the city.
I know that you know.
I thought you'd be interested in this.
It was summer and the weather was warm.
I'm in the bathtub.
He soon accustomed himself to cold weather.
I can't follow you.
That was very rude.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
Why limit yourself to just one?
I feel like going to bed early tonight.
I would like to know how these substances are absorbed by the body.
No one is saying that.

Let's hope Tom was right.
I think you need to spend a little more time on your homework.
Write to Tom.
I must be blind.
I figured you wouldn't want the teacher to know you hadn't done your homework yet.

Can you hold the elevator, please?
We went to Australia last summer.
It's too easy.
We're on our own.
Could you keep your eye out for my car keys?
I'm not going to compete.
It's a lovely day.
I'll pay for you.
Tom had the only pool in town with a diving board.
What is the number?
I didn't think you were needed.
How long are we supposed to keep this up?
I think you look fine.
I looked up the words in my dictionary.
Where does he live?
You remind me of somebody.
I'm not able to do that by myself.
I've seen this picture before.
I'll do the work tomorrow.
No doubt she will win in the end.
Get Tom to help you.
I wanted to go outside and get a breath of fresh air.
Is this some kind of joke?
I'm going to give you one more chance.
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
She recovered from her long illness.
Are you trying to manipulate me?
Do you like to sing?
Could you talk a little slower?
It's not easy for me.
I've been riding so long I'm starting to smell like my horse.
Tom changed his diet.
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye.
Tell me what to do and I will do it.
Why did he do such a thing?
I wish they would stop fighting.
Is it OK if we begin?
I'm not like everybody else.
I accompanied her on the piano.
I'll ask him.
You can borrow my pen.
What about us?
Don't blame me.
I wanted to hear you say that.
Don't share this with anyone.
French is an interesting language.
The children are crying again.
I was bitterly disappointed.
Excuse me, could you repeat that?
Are you sure that's necessary?
Look again.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
He has ambition, so he works hard.
No matter what happens, I won't be surprised.
I don't regret doing that.
I don't have time to deal with this letter. Could you deal with it?
Tom nodded quickly.
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
That could take days.
You and I aren't like that.
He contributed a lot of money to the charity.
The new boy had a nervous stammer.
The prosecutor asked me a leading question.

The banks aren't open on Saturdays.
Have fun in Boston.
It is time to go to school.
I have some shopping to do.
I want to talk to you about this list.
They can't hurt you.
You know what you must do.
Would anyone else like to speak?
I am not concerned with this.
Who's the girl I saw you talking with?
You seem distracted today.
This jacket is a little too big.
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do.
Never say never.
I'd like a hug.
I feel powerless.
I used to have a girlfriend.
I became acquainted with your dad yesterday.
Everyone's reading.
Tom asked Mary what she had bought at the jewelry store.
My clock seems to be broken.
I am not wearing any underwear.
The policeman blamed the taxi driver for the accident.
Tom is extremely narrow-minded.
She allegedly killed him.
Will you have a cup of tea?
Tom mopped the kitchen floor.
Who painted this painting?
This stain won't come out.
Let me take your coats.
A friend I went with on our first trip abroad had his wallet pickpocketed. I don't think it left a very good impression.
Tom drinks wine.
Do as he tells you.
I looked at the picture.
Everything looked nice.
No one knew it.
Just get off the stage.
I think we're out of your size.
Who made the actual arrest?
Did Tom make this for you?
I wonder why I'm so sleepy.
Tom is wearing the sunglasses he bought yesterday.
What don't you have?
All you have to do is to make a comment.
We'll begin work soon.
This one's all yours.
He leaves for China tomorrow.
I confessed to stealing the money.
I'm not dumb.
I don't know what I've been so afraid of.
I need to wash my hands.
Please prepare for the trip.
I see you are ready.
You're tired.
Why don't you sit and have a drink with me?
I suppose you won't mind if I take one.
We're newcomers.
Tom likes country music.
How old is this book?
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
Recently we have had several disasters.
Where do you get your ideas from?
It's rare to find big yards in Japan.
That should make you happy.
I will ask him tomorrow.
The fire was so intense that the firemen couldn't get into the house.
Can I take a day off?
You're cruel.
I kept my mouth shut.
What do you think he did?
You are a student.
Do you feel birthdays are important?
Don't talk to anybody about this.
Please write down your contact address here.
I don't like sad movies.
Just tell me the truth. I promise I won't get mad.
Never give up on your dreams.
Tom, do you still love me?
You have such beautiful, hazel eyes.
She'd never been so frightened.
You're such a jerk.
Tom is now three months old.
Tie your shoes.
Now that you have made your decision, you must act.
They were afraid of being overheard.
He often comes late to school.
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
You're fashionable.
The coffee is too strong.
I wrote this book.
Tom is the legal owner of this piece of land.
He was too shy to do that.
I'll try.
He makes mountains out of molehills.
He gave me not only advice but also money.
That was not my question.
He agreed to give us an interview.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
Do you promise never to lie again?
I saw his car make a right turn.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
Tom was my first husband.
I'd like to take a closer look at that.
He told me to meet him at his apartment.
You're wasting water.
How long did it last?
My whole body was shaking.
Where did you take these pictures?
Tom put new pedals on the bicycle that he rides to school.
I think you'd better go.
What would the others say?
Have you heard from him?
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
Just keep moving.
I came to talk about Tom.
That's not funny.
I just can't help you right now.
Everyone knew what went wrong.
You didn't let me answer.
We're all different.
She likes painting pictures.
I don't feel very well.
You're the teacher.
Nobody understands it.
They are both good.
Do you know how to play the piano?
You don't even know how.
No criminal charges will be filed against you.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
He was a rugby player.
I have lunch at noon with my friends.
We went to the beach together.
What do you plan on doing tonight?
I never want to see you get sick.
Tom always treats me like a child.
I'm not mentally prepared for that.
What time did you wake up this morning?
How was your doctor's appointment?
You didn't try hard enough.
I was knocked unconscious.
Would you like this?
Is this your bicycle?
The boy didn't change his opinion.
I've tried them all.
What are some foods you usually eat with chopsticks?
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
It was Tom who told me you were sick.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
The tiger was killed.
I know how difficult this is for you.
Are you real sure about that?
Where was I?
How do you think I look? "Very pretty."
Let's get home.
I put on my trousers.
I must go alone.
Would you stop doing that, please?
Do you have a passport?
Tom went up the stairs quickly.
Look at it carefully.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
It seems that you're not having a good time here.
There's nobody at the door.
Too much is at stake.
What else can you tell us?
He died before I arrived.
You seem a little depressed.
Why do you want a dog?
I shouldn't have told you anything.
I knew they were on the list.
I know that would make you happy.
I want you to help.
You are too critical of others' shortcomings.
Tom seems courteous.
This criminal is morally depraved.
She's too old for you.
He was not allowed to remain silent.
I think about you often.
You're almost right.
That sounds urgent.
Have you prepared everything for tomorrow?
Several cottages have been isolated by the flood water.
They made fun of me.
I got up earlier than usual in order to catch the first train.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
You're one of them, aren't you?
You don't seem to want to come with us.
The explorers cut their way through the forest.
You can get a car license after you turn eighteen.
You're a good actor.
I have to help my mother.
We love you so much.
Is that supposed to cheer me up?
I figured out a way to make more money.
I spent all day in the library.
I'm glad I was able to do this.
How much is this?
Where should we pitch the tent?
We arrived tired and hungry.
Guess what I've got for you.
How much do you feed your dog?
Shall I get you a chair?
Cheers!
No matter what happens, you must be here by nine.
Are you blowing me off?
Can he see me?
My sister is thin, but I'm a little overweight.
Do you want to come in?
Let's get a drink.
Why are you imitating me?
Tom asked Mary to go to the supermarket to get some milk.
She had an unassuming air that put everyone at ease.
Tom told Mary that it was over.
I retired in 2013.
You should marry someone you love.
Hello!
It's been a while since I've studied French.
This table isn't steady.
It serves our purpose.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
You're not supposed to be in here.
I hate golf.
Is there somewhere in Europe you'd like to visit?
Someone stole all my money.
Simmer the butter and garlic in a small saucepan.
He is more clever than I am.
I will have finished the work before you return.
Explain that to me.
He is very honest.
I hope you won't be disappointed.
Do you want to sit down?
Read this now.
I should've asked.
They have very little to live on.
It's natural to be nervous when the plane takes off.
Clean up that mess.
The water has boiled away.
I wake up at six, but I don't get out of bed until seven.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
Tom will be famous.
I will have lived here for ten years next month.
The ring was not to be found anywhere.
You're the same age as my girlfriend.
We have to give Tom a chance.
What happened? The car's slowing down.
Stay out of this.
Was that your question?
You'd have done the same.
I wish we could do that.
I continued working.
He has seen better days.
I really enjoy spending time with you.
I can't depend on you anymore.
I'm not the one who should be doing this.
You deserve a medal.
I'm busy, so I can't go.
The thermometer is an instrument for measuring temperature.
Don't make me stay.
Am I being accused of murder?
Did you buy a new car?
I left my wallet at home.
We haven't actually set a date yet.
He is not too poor to buy a bicycle.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
I need a new one.
This is all very confusing.
Do you think that's the answer?
How far do you live from here?
I would have bought that car if I'd had the money.
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
Tom showed me what he meant.
I fixed it.
I thought we weren't going to go there.
Would you like some coffee?
Who has a better idea?
There's a storm coming.
I was born there.
I play golf every chance I get.
Do you have Japanese newspapers?
How much is your hourly pay?
No one was in the swimming pool.
I figured it out by myself.
Cotton absorbs water.
I caught a couple of big fish.
Why don't people hibernate?
You may bring whoever you like.
It always happens this way.
I want to do my job the best I can.
How do you feel about all this?
Stay in your room.
If you don't eat, you'll die.
The ship ran aground on a sandbar.
Man to man, what are the facts?
We weren't invited to the party.
Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
I applaud your decision to study medicine.
I no longer believe anything you say.
That's probably a good idea.
Tom only thinks about money.
I've never liked that.
This isn't supposed to be happening.
You should assume that Tom won't help us at all.
Nobody could give the correct answer.
Did you carry out your plan?
Would you mind turning down the volume?
I'm not asleep.
I'm not good at public speaking.
Tom stole it.
What do you grow on your farm?
They're able students.
His new book is going to come out next month.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
They don't have one.
Move back a little.
I'd love to sing for you.
This was supposed to be simple.
They said you were fired.
I can't see anything from here.
What would he know?
Get in the van.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
I can prove it to you.
I bought it for ten dollars.
Tom put on his wetsuit.
I want to go to Sweden.
I'm sure there's a connection.
Looking at his face, you could tell that he was annoyed.
How did you become involved in this project?
Now you've come of age, you have the right to vote.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
I asked you last night.
Why are you so hungry?
Keep next Sunday free.
What do you need me to do?
She couldn't convince him to buy her a new car.
Pass me the sugar, please.
She promised me that she'd come.
If it snows on the mountain, it is cold in the valley.

I made a bet.
I want to know what you're doing here.
He's a well-known television personality.
We don't have any strawberry ice cream.
I thought you were working.
He told me to meet him at his house.
How many pictures did Tom take?
The house was burned to the ground.
They aren't alone.
Tom often helps Mary.
It doesn't seem possible, does it?
I think it's time for me to buy a house.
He has overcome many obstacles.
You don't seem too sure.
Things will only get worse.
We need to maintain focus.
I like swimming very much.
She was falsely accused.
Tom can't do anything about that.
How many eggs could you get yesterday?
I heard explosions.
You're obviously in great shape.
I want to spend time with you.
What a good shot!
I really appreciated your help yesterday afternoon.
Tell the maid to make the beds.
Cockfighting is illegal in many countries.

She deposited a large sum of money in the bank.
Tom looks as though he's seen a ghost.
I have another plan.
His son is a genius.
A lot of soldiers died here.
What did he do to you?
Yesterday was hot.
That should be kept between us.
He warned me of the danger.
Did you read what I wrote?
Would you like to travel abroad?
Where were you born?
The streetlight over there is broken.
What do you have to complain about?
Tom and Mary rearranged the furniture in their living room.
Why were you late this morning?
Let's order a pizza.
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
I have two questions for you.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Give me a full glass of water.
He is engaged to my younger sister.
Tom was right after all.
I've ordered you a beer.
How could you be so cruel?
I hope I didn't make a fool of myself.
It seemed to work.
He often plays piano.
You're part of my life.
Is everybody hungry?
We started a band because we were bored.
I want you to know how sorry I am.
You need to smile more.
He took a taxi both ways.
Is there any butter in the refrigerator?
We need to get going.
He did it not for me but for himself.
What are you punishing them for?
I love looking at everyone's colorful kimonos on Coming of Age Day.
The rule doesn't apply in this case.
I wrote this song just for you.
He might not be happy.
He fell in love with her.
That would be weird.
I want to have a part-time job, too.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
Can I dial direct?
The nurse gave you a sedative.
Tom was caught selling drugs to kids.
I've arranged for a bit of privacy.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
I kind of hope it doesn't rain.
I thought you were a Canadian.
I have an announcement.
I'm tired of everything.
This bird can imitate the human voice.
We must not forget our promise.
You were happy, weren't you?
We have it all.
Do you want a little cake?
Tom has a store in Boston.
Why have you been avoiding me?
I didn't realize you were awake.
Tom is just afraid.
Is that a promise?
He was holding a large box in his arms.
He is a British citizen, but lives in India.
I didn't steal it.
The negotiations failed.
Doing it that way will take a long time.
I had no other choice but to take him at his word.
I thought we'd be safe here.
Sixty percent of Japanese adult males drink alcoholic beverages on a regular basis.
I'm sure that's none of my business.
Women usually live longer than men.
I want to be an actor.
Where is your father?
Of course.
He handles horses well.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Two families live in the house.
I feel like I'm making progress.
I didn't see anybody following us.
We went on foot.
You know that I like you.
He treats me as an adult.
I took a cab to the station.
The building collapsed in the earthquake.
You're all happy.
You can't see everything.
This is a good movie.
Do you smoke?
My car is now being repaired.
I'm not blind.
Some students were sitting on the bench and having lunch.
Teach me how you do it.
I heard that she came here.
I'll just wait.
She served me coffee.
I've never tried.
He's a frat boy.
He is here!
He tried with all his might to push the door open.
You'd better hurry up.
I was bitten on the leg by a dog.
Who's coming for dinner?
You have something of mine.
Push the button, please.
Do you want to watch TV?
As long as we've driven this far, we might as well go on.
You're right about that one.
Why do you want to live in Australia?
Just a minute. I'm coming.
We're gonna make sure that no one is taking advantage of the American people for their own short-term gain.
While he was sick, he lost a lot of weight.
I'll be thinking of you every day while I'm away.
This is an institution for the criminally insane.
I forgave you a long time ago.
I'm going fishing with him.
I want you to go to the doctor.
Tom left Mary a message on the table.
I just don't believe you.
You look like you're busy.
I never see this picture without thinking of my father.
I'm willing to apologize.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
Dolphins are playful animals.
You don't have to apologize.
He was involved in a traffic accident.
The more we learn, the better we realize our ignorance.
I'd like to go somewhere else now.
Although most islands in the ocean have been mapped, the ocean floor is generally unknown.
Why is Tom acting so childish?
I will not let you do it.
Do you mind if I turn off the light?
I was at a loss for words.
I'm sure they'll be very happy together.
I saw her last week.
Neither of my brothers will be there.
We used a barrel for a makeshift table.
You're resourceful.
I'd like to buy you a beer.
I wasn't that smart in school.
The Mormons have outlawed polygamy, but some adherents still practice it.
Did you call me up last night?
Tom was convinced, but not me.
Tom opened the balcony window.
You were there, weren't you?
I have a schedule to keep.
The bank had the gall to charge a late fee for a payment held up when their online services crashed.
I know what a stapler is.
The radio is too loud.
He sticks to his principles.
I was looking for the right words.
Mary is Tom's sister.
That was my mistake.
I don't think we can guarantee your safety.
I'm a salesperson.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Is there a flower shop in the hotel?
I can't put up with him any longer.
Get ready.
They searched here and there looking for survivors.
They're part of a football team.
Television helps us widen our knowledge.
Do you know what's going on there?
Every religion prohibits murder.
I might have to get my tonsils out.
I really don't envy you.
Your dream will come true in the near future.
I know what my choices are.
Tom knows he shouldn't have said that.
I love performing.
I want to live in a big city.
I can't be killed so easily.
Will you eat dinner?
He's after me.
I'm not particularly worried.
He has a lot of books on history.
She reserved a room.
Tom looks like an accountant.
He plays the piano very well.
You are both pretty and kind.
Let me tell you how I really feel.
I didn't know why I wasn't supposed to go to that part of town.
I'm glad you're still here.
I'll send you home in my car.
My wife didn't come with me.
I didn't do what you think I did.
We should use the electric blankets tonight.
I'm always careful.
That war ended in 1954.
Tom asked Mary to wait for him in front of the library.
That's a pity.
I can't believe I never knew that.
I don't really feel like reading.
I thought I was too young.
Tom found the problem.
I think you should tell Tom you love him.
He pretended not to hear his boss.
I think we've wasted enough of your time.
I am ready to do anything for you.
We can't just sit here without doing anything.
You're the only one who can do it.
I understand you.
I never even considered that.
Did the police find any fingerprints?
I didn't cancel the meeting.
Everyone sat down.
Who painted that?
The blood stain can't be removed.
It's OK to be scared, Tom.
Tom is Mary's husband's best friend.
She may be late, in which case we will wait.
Do you think you could make it before lunch?
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
My father loves pizza.
You won't be disappointed.
I will never forget your kindness as long as I live.
You're no singer.
I'll go downstairs.
We got stuck in traffic.
We should have a drink.
We're part of the team.
He traveled all over the world.
It is my cat.
My brother speaks very fast.
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
A new difficulty has arisen.
The tree fell over in the typhoon.
We're all in the same situation.
I usually don't make mistakes.
Tom despises people who lie.
Please breathe through your nose.
There's something I want to try.
English is spoken in America.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Tom said he had a slight cold.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
You left your lights on.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
We thought you didn't like it.
He flatly refused to let me in.
A fund was launched to set up a monument in memory of the dead man.
They look so cute together.
It suddenly started raining.
I still find it hard to believe.
She didn't show up.
I'm giving my old books away.
I think your hypothesis is correct.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
He wrote me a long letter.
You look great.
Tom didn't mention any of this to me.
Can you translate English into Japanese?
We don't live in a perfect world.
The doctor's remarks reassured the patient.
Tom tripled his investment in six months.
She lives in quite a big mansion.
He took off his clothes.
How did you get so good at French?
I was curious to know why people had been staring at me.
She divorced her husband.
Are you up for it?
Barack Obama is a Christian.
I thought you'd be much fatter.
His old car is on its last legs.
Tom did everything I told him to.
It's too cold.
They all cheated.
How is the wife?
Would that make you happy?
Did I call at a bad time?
Lie still.
Do you have a mobile phone?
If you need my advice, I'd be glad to give it to you.
All my friends like the same kind of music that I do.
I'm still your friend.
The problem is as good as settled.
Are you sure that it was Tom?
Where's the toilet?
I know Tom is infuriated.
Can you promise me that?
I don't plan on being a waiter all my life.
My grandfather died in the same room in which he was born.
Think outside the box.
This will be easy.
I have lost the key.
Why did you agree to help them?
Everyone suddenly burst into laughter.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
What about this dress?
I didn't want to miss the party.
I know what they're capable of.
All the flowers in the garden are yellow.
She said that she saw a suspicious man.
He took a taxi to the station.
She walked as fast as she could to catch up with him.
Do you think I'm crazy?
She wriggled her toes.
You're unambitious.
I don't have time to make you a sandwich.
I can't believe I listened to you.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
He makes the most of his opportunities.
I want us not to get caught.
He became so excited that what he said made no sense at all.
I'm the youngest one here.
Don't get any ideas.
They'll take me away.
Trim the fat off the meat.
You're done working, aren't you?
That's a very good question.
Two seats remained vacant.
I must know the truth about him.
What direction are you going?
You're not old enough to drink.
Don't worry. I'm not mad at you.
I don't speak French, but I can understand it a bit.
I went to your school.
Try it on.
Father took his place at the head of the table and began to say grace.
I was good.
Be nicer to your sister.
The baby kept quiet.
I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
Please stop.
We need a signed receipt.
The workers came to ask about their pay raises.
It seems to me that something's wrong.
I didn't know you played the oboe.
I told Tom why I went to Australia.
Have you chosen a topic?
No one should be surprised.
It took a long time for her to write the report.
We are all eager to know the truth.
I was born in America.
It's not that I don't want to go, I can't afford to.
I began doing that three years ago.
Is that why you're upset?
Unfortunately he refused to come.
I've spent most of my life here in Boston.
We just want to live in peace.
Are you serious?
I want to give you the chance to do that.
It won't be easy to forget you.
You're stupid to trust him.
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?
I really don't think I can do that.
We'll win.
Do you want to see the list?
You know where to find me if you need anything.
I don't have a ticket.
Is that all you want to say?
I thought about writing you a message, but never got around to it.
You're fine.
They teased the new student.
They clung together for warmth.
Everybody wants to protect you.
That's not really true.
I don't know whether you're happy or not.
This is the best restaurant I know of.
He's the perfect man for you.
Let's act like we're foreigners.
Tom and Mary are getting ready to go out.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
I think we should try to do that.
What has he done to you?
I had hoped you might say that.
Make good use of this opportunity.
Tom gave me this watch.
Whose chair is this? "It is mine."
My bicycle is much newer than yours.
Who wrote that?
Clearly, this is the most important point.
We just have to be patient.
What a ridiculous concept!
Are there survivors?
All you have to do is sit down here and answer the doctor's questions.
Is one thousand yen enough?
He ignores my problems.
I cannot thank you too much.
Long hair is out of fashion now.
I should've paid attention.
I called them.
You dropped your handkerchief.
I could kill you now.
Why don't you go take a nap?
Telegraph us when you get to Boston.
That is a pure waste of time.
Besides being a surgeon, he was a famous writer.
I can't believe I'm really here.
There's a lot to do.
I was worried about his health.
What're we looking for?
We'll stay out of your way.
I can't give it to you.
I just want to be a good neighbor.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
I plan to go to the movies.
Let me do that.
Nobody deserves that.
Three of them were hospitalized.
He gave it a new name.
I'm sure Tom will come tomorrow.
I can speak French.
How's your project coming along?
Hi! What's new?
Don't climb up the wall.
That's my cat.
I'm a little sick.
These are the shoes that I bought last week.
I can't endure that noise a moment longer.
Tom was disappointed in Mary's performance.
Muammar Kaddafi escaped unharmed.
Jazz fusion is a combination of rock and jazz.
He rarely goes to the movies.
I made myself a cup of hot chocolate.
You're very forward.
We enjoyed watching the fireworks on a bridge last summer.
Have you seen anyone else?
I think it's time for us to leave.
The first time, she wasn't very firm with him.
It's been nice meeting you.
I wish you would take me to a restaurant for a change.
Tom is chopping wood.
You can't blame me.
Generally speaking, men are stronger than women.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
I'm pleased with his performance.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
I suppose it makes sense to go ahead and pay the bill right now.
You don't have to take an examination.
Tom agrees with what you say.
Do you have anything to add?
Maybe you got the date wrong.
I had a heart attack.
Give grandma a kiss.
The book is red.
They kissed in the rain.
I have some personal business to take care of.
He should thank me.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
Practice is the best teacher.
Sorry to trouble you, but can you help me?
We got ready.
The search for alien life is one of humankind's greatest technological challenges.
After much debate, we decided to spend our holidays in Spain.
They're out to get you.
None of them wanted to talk.
I'll get my son to go instead of going myself.
We should write a formal letter to the director.
What the devil are you doing?
I want you gone by sunrise.
You're in grave danger.
He elbowed his way through the crowd.
Tom returned to his office.
I'm going to buy Tom something.
I can look at it when you're ready.
I haven't seen Tom in three days.
If by some chance it rains, the garden party won't take place.
I won't be ready to do that until Monday.
Tom may be old, but he's in good shape.
Have you ever been married?
I didn't recognize it at all.
I thought Tom had a soccer game tonight.
Why don't you repaint your house?
They were talking about you.
All you have to do is push this button to take a picture.
I love to eat scallops.
We could try to find the key.
That's good news to me.
He's such a great guy.
I'm not invited to parties.
We've gone too far.
Let's sit down in the shade of that tree.
Everybody wants permanent peace.
Is that one of ours?
I didn't even see you once last year.
I'm ambitious.
He hasn't returned yet.
Where are your grandsons?
I confessed.
I'm not going to let you boss me around.
I am the first musician in my family.
Parents must provide their children with proper food and clothing.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
I hope that will change soon.
Are there any risks?
I can't remember where we did that.
I'm exhausted.
I think you ought to listen.
I was jealous of my brother.
He is being very careful.
He was court-martialed for dereliction of duty.
It's done.
I left my umbrella at home.
I'm so proud of you.
I believed you.
Everyone wanted to dance.
He never fully recovered from his injuries.
She must have done it yesterday.
She stayed at a hotel.
What time is it now? "It's ten o'clock."
You said you were busy.
They do it faster than me.
Schools are closed for Christmas.
Look at the picture on the wall.
How many did you get?
They can't hear me either.
I told you his name was Tom, didn't I?
No, he didn't.
Let her replace it.
Can you read what that says?
I no longer believe that.
I want you to be quiet.
The weather report says it will rain tomorrow afternoon.
Whose friend is he?
There is wet paint on the door.
He was getting old.
You sure are pretty.
Do you know the girl waving at us over there?
She sat next to him on the bus.
You're not listening!
Don't touch anything without asking.
What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
You're fun.
My father neither drinks nor smokes.
A voyage to the moon in a spaceship is no longer a dream.
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me.
I'm very glad I wasn't there.
Do it again!
What are you smiling at?
We were concerned.
I saw a spider walking on the ceiling.
We are looking for somebody who can use a computer.
A delicate balance must be reached.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
The president is expected to put forward a new energy policy.
I just got out of prison three months ago.
You're not fit.
It happened to someone I know.
Would you work for minimum wage?
They tried to discourage him from going.
Now drink up.
She has brown eyes.
She didn't like him at first.
I'm so glad.
Why don't you come to the movies with me?
Perhaps we'll see each other again tonight.
Your friends are late.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Where are my clothes?
This song is very popular in Japan.
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
He is very learned.
How would you know?
I appreciate your restraint.
Can you help me on this one?
What would you do if you had one year free?
Where have you been? "I have been to the station to see a friend off."
Why is it so hard for people to understand that I just want to be left alone?
I wonder if he is married.
I think Tom told you the truth.
I don't want you to dance with Tom anymore.
She taught him how to play the piano.
Am I speaking too quickly?
You knew Tom better than I did.
No one liked President Buchanan's message to Congress.
I can't tell you. It's a secret and if I told you, it wouldn't be a secret anymore.
Tom and Mary agreed on a price.
I wish I could tell you the reason, but I can't.
She put the key in her bag.
He hopes to visit Paris.
The city hall isn't far from here.
You shouldn't go to school.
I hesitated about which road to take.
Can you force them to do that?
What's Tom drinking?
The world is dangerous.
His wife has started to work out of necessity.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
How does Tom's suggestion strike you?
How about another piece of cake?
It's gotten dark. Please turn on the light for me.
We enjoyed playing chess last night.
Are you envious?
He blamed his teacher for his failure in the entrance examination.
When was the potato introduced in Japan?
A guard's been killed.
Tom owns a lot of cars.
I'm not saying that's wrong.
I'm puzzled.
I know how tiring that can be.
I felt like I was intruding.
What's he doing there?
This is a message for you.
This is possible.
Tom says he will never go there again.
On a first date, it's best to steer clear of touchy subjects.
I made tea.
He is an environmentalist.
You're asking the wrong guy.
Tom plays the baritone saxophone and Mary plays the alto saxophone.
She couldn't help bursting into laughter.
What did Tom really want?
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Do you like it?
I know that Tom did that for us.
Can you tell me the time?
After an absence of seven years, I went home.
They assigned the task to us.
I am disappointed at the news.
She's been in the hospital for a month.
I wasn't really in the mood to go out.
I can't believe he renounced his U.S. citizenship.
Tom's carrying something in his left hand.
When poverty comes in the door, love flies out the window is a saying as old as it is sad.
There's no shortage of work.
She is ashamed of what she's done.
You looked exhausted.
I know what to do.
Open the window, please.
I was disappointed with your paper.
It shouldn't be a secret.
The sky grew darker and darker.
His ideas are quite different from mine.
Get out if you can.
I appreciate all you did.
I was late for school this morning.
At that time, I was still awake.
He has dedicated his life to the preservation of nature.
There's someone I want you to meet.
I just don't know if I'm good enough.
His wife doesn't seem ugly to me.
Can you iron this T-shirt for me, please?
None of the teachers could solve the problem.
Women usually live longer than men.
What he said applies, to a certain extent, to this case.
What evidence do you have?
They can't do that.
I've enjoyed my stay.
You're not the only one with this problem.
She is making dinner.
They camped on the beach.
What did you get hit with?
The price of gas is rising.
I've changed. I'm not the same man I used to be.
It has a leak.
You're a dreamer.
I wish that I could do more to help.
I'll send you the bill.
Thanks for the info.
Look in front of you.
Tom is determined, isn't he?
What's your blood type?
I know that you love Tom.
If you can't beat them, join them.
It's an outrage.
I was a bit unlucky.
Tom likes science fiction.
I can't go into details.
Instead of cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
He breathed his last.
Do I look like a policeman to you?
Tom and Mary aren't alone.
I must insist.
My throat feels dry.
I get hives when I eat eggs.
Ask if he wants another drink.
Would you like a little more salad?
There is a television in the room.
I want you to give each other a hug.
I'm anxious whether I'll do well at this new job.
I have a sharp pain here.
I'm not going to go in there.
Tom did his best to persuade Mary.
It wouldn't be the first time that has happened.
How good are you?
There's no one sitting here.
Grandmother looks after the children during the day.
We felt sympathy for her.
It's high time you were in bed.
I don't have time to do the laundry.
He's on his last legs.
That wasn't one of the choices.
Tom always gets up at six-thirty.
It's not rocket science.
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
His students adored him.
Is this really what you want to do?
I think they know you.
The Nozomi is the fastest of all the trains in Japan.
I need something to write with.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Don't you have friends?
What was it that you did there?
We're married.
I don't think we can guarantee your safety.
She is always smoking.
Please telephone me before you come.
I got hot.
I want to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
This tastes like soap.
He does not know what it is to be poor.
She demanded to see the manager.
The supplies are beginning to give out.
You're the most important person in my life.
When was that?
I just need some advice.
Have you ever driven a sports car?
I should've gone with Tom.
I looked all over for Tom.
Mary had a flower in her hair.
My skirt is too long.
All the inmates are present and accounted for.
He studied to be a doctor.
Don't you know who that is?
I'm at an office party.
You shouldn't have let this happen.
Can you help me plant this shrub?
The book was so gripping, I could hardly put it down.
A book is always an acceptable gift.
Please remember to mail this letter.
I felt awkward around them.
Be proud of yourself.
I have to do something else first.
I'm really not busy.
I might be wrong.
He earns more money than he can spend.
The news was unbelievably terrible.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
She attacked him with her fists.
I would like to talk with you again.
Your time is up.
Soon nobody will have anything to do with you.
He'll make a good husband.
Measure each angle of the triangle.
She said she had a slight cold.
Please say it in English.
It's a bit flimsy.
I want to do what's right.
I'd love to go fishing with you.
Can you forget your native language?
Promise me you'll never do that again.
Who are you all?
This must be changed.
An autopsy will be done in the next few days.
They're staying.
I remember it vividly.
What happened to your guitar?
Since when are you two on a first name basis?
Tom is left-handed, isn't he?
When was the last time you got your hair cut?
I'm looking for batteries.
I wasn't aware that you were feeling so bad.
The mail is delivered once a day.
That's our best hope.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
It was hot, so I turned on the fan.
It cost me a fortune to get my car repaired.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
This is a hybrid.
Is that better?
Our visitors are sitting in the living room.
I wouldn't do that without you.
What's happening here?
She didn't take many photos.
I've been put in charge of this project.
Tom warned you.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
That's happening far too often.
Do you want the job or not?
Please turn down the volume.
I'll be singing a song at Tom and Mary's wedding.
If you really like Mary, you should ask her out.
Am I not right?
I feel so happy when I'm with you.
It's all in the room.
There's something I want to show you.
Stop playing hard to get.
I'm not sure I understand.
I'd never do that to you.
I'm happy, too.
I just can't wait to do that.
That sounds like a fairly good proposal.
You seem to be making progress.
I need new shoes.
I don't hold grudges.
I dislike cold weather.
I leave that to you.
Life is not fair. Get used to it.
Did Tom talk to you about his plans for next weekend?
What a horrible thing!
She witnessed him being killed.
I always have a lot of fun when I come here.
This is how I did it.
We're going in first.
She put on her sweater.
I had a happy childhood.
I think you should get it.
Don't you want to put in another disc? We've been listening to this one for two hours.
It is time for me to take a vacation.
No one believes him.
I had to accept it.
We invited ten couples to the party.
Would you please wait for a minute?
Are you coming down?
This is what I can do for you.
How tall you are!
Did you do that for me?
These three hours of driving have worn me out. Let's stop at the first rest area we see.
I'm sick of hearing the same thing all the time.
He can barely read.
Tom learned how to do that from his grandfather.
Water is heavier than oil.
He's three years older than she is.
He has enough ability to manage a business.
That's the tough part.
He paused to have a cigarette.
We had to make the best of our small house.
I'm feeling kind of tired.
We need experts.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
I had a hunch you would do that.
He committed suicide by taking poison.
I don't really understand why.
Get in the boat.
I had a mishap.
Tom can play the banjo.
Are you going to eat the rest of your stew?
He is a professor of English at Leeds.
I have a message I want you to deliver.
I don't think you should do that.
What is there to understand?
A black and white dog bit me.
I was as surprised as you.
He's waiting for the train to leave.
The door is locked at nine o'clock.
He has an eye for antiques.
Tom gets up at six every morning.
Please tell me where to park my car.
Do you know that guy?
I like having people around me.
That's absolutely right.
He has come!
He took a notebook out.
That's not good enough for Tom.
I'm sorry to upset your plans.
Start the car.
Science can be used for good or evil purposes.
I have a very busy schedule today.
His father approved of his plan.
The phone rang for a long time.
I'm afraid this data is not reliable.
He is ashamed to ask questions.
Did you know that?
Don't expect any mercy from me.
Tom is no ordinary man.
I felt cheated.
Have I caught you at a bad time?
You don't have a temperature.
I did what was necessary.
Is that your girlfriend?
Do you mean what you say?
Mary helped Tom.
I have to go to the city.
A hundred people were hurt in a train wreck.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
My daughter is fast asleep.
Who are you supposed to be?
I'll sleep on the couch.
Where would you like to go?
Pay attention to what Tom says.
Everyone tried to sell their stocks.
He washes the car every week.
I couldn't hear anything you said.
You are so childish sometimes.
Maybe Tom is in love.
That's my idea.
I'm getting a bit confused.
You must be out of your mind.
Make a wish.
He is quite right.
Do you understand how this works?
Come off it.
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.
We must think about these plans in terms of what they would cost.
Tom just can't seem to get along with Mary.
I saw it.
You can read French, can't you?
I'll come back. I promise.
A cup of coffee cost 200 yen in those days.
I do not like both of them.
We are sorry for the interruption.
I think I will take a vacation this week.
Without you, I would've died.
What was that noise?
I can't put up with the inconvenience of country life.
Was I snoring?
We'll join you shortly.
It is a pity you cannot come.
They're animals.
I met an old student of mine in London.
Tom will never allow that.
You should know better than to talk back to your boss.
It is good to be a winner.
I did something wrong.
It's a snowstorm.
That wouldn't be smart.
I'm not very eager to go.
I thought I was going to become a doctor.
Never confuse art with life.
She loves cooking.
Does she have a piano?
Do you have a bottle opener I could use?
Tom certainly fooled us all.
My future is in your hands.
You're the best singer I know.
You're very direct.
My husband is difficult to live with.
Just tell them no.
You don't have to answer.
My family enjoyed the picnic.
I wanted to die.
I can't smoke.
Do you know how to use this?
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
It was frustrating.
Do you want him to know about it?
I don't approve your decision.
Did I give you enough time?
He is to come to my house tonight.
I want to apologize to everybody.
Could you hand me the remote?
I'm just an average girl.
That's what you should say.
In hindsight, this was a mistake.
This is always the way it has been.
Of the 23 who were arrested, four escaped.
Tom knew that Mary had done her best.
He did it, and what was more surprising, he did it by himself.
Tom's dog hates cats.
That's all I ask.
I'm not home on Sundays.
Why would they do that?
Don't tell me you're not scared.
What do you say we go for a swim?
Be kind to others.
I'm not here for you.
It's a good sign.
Is this new model available on the market?
They left without me.
It was not my intention to hurt your feelings.
I'm not even thinking about it.
My mother teaches flower arranging.
What are your measurements?
I had to stop.
Tom took a couple of steps back.
I figured that might be the case.
The snow melted away in a day.
I'm sorry that you didn't sleep well.
You're very flexible.
It's driving me crazy.
You're double-parked.
There are lots of presents underneath the Christmas tree.
I want to practice with you.
Did you get the flowers?
Stop it right now!
I was heavily sedated.
I don't have much ready money.
I was on my knees.
He studies history at college.
How is it going?
Tom isn't always wrong.
I won't cry.
I won't fail this time.
Can I use your pen?
They didn't see anything.
Tom never trusted Mary.
Where did you meet your boyfriend?
Take care of it.
That's my cat.
The unrest lasted three days.
I want the facts.
You always ask too many questions.
We're not doing this for the money.
I don't think I can make it to your party.
Something's wrong.
There is often fog in the morning.
Girls are often judged by how attractive they are.
You can use my dictionary.
She walked very carefully.
I'm at your disposal.
I don't love you that much.
You could hear a pin drop.
My brother just received tenure at the university where he teaches.
His words surprised me.
I love to party.
What did you see in the kitchen?
Tom wants to be a diplomat.
The people expected a victory speech.
I will sue you.
I stretched out my legs.
I will go and take a look at the house.
It came to nothing.
Someone might see us.
They were in that room with me all night.
You've got your permit, right?
School starts at 8:40.
She puts aside a lot of money.
I really do have to get back to work.
Hurry up! We're late.
These gifts are for you.
My uncle gave me a present.
She won't like this.
Can you figure out this problem?
The street is full of cars.
Who wants to go hunting?
It may be impossible to get a completely error-free corpus due to the nature of this kind of collaborative effort. However, if we encourage members to contribute sentences in their own languages rather than experiment in languages they are learning, we might be able to minimize errors.
Can I tell my father what you want?
It's cool today.
Do you want me to close the window?
I didn't know how to express myself.
I want to hear you play the piano.
She always buys expensive clothes.
It is said that treasure is buried in this area.
I haven't seen them in a long time.
Tom doesn't think it'll rain tomorrow.
Tom can't help you now.
Slip on your shoes.
Tom lost his hearing.
You're jealous.
That's probably what happened.
I went there for the purpose of meeting him.
He laughed nervously.
I can't figure this out.
I didn't realize you were awake.
She turned the doorknob slowly.
Do it when you have time.
I require your advice.
What don't you want me to do?
I like the sound of your voice.
I'm about the same age as you.
I love that suit.
How can you stand it?
The first goal seems achievable.
Is this your daughter?
Parents should spend quality time with their children.
What are some foods commonly eaten in America?
I told Tom to keep fighting.
I want to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
I remember reading about it.
My mother set the table for dinner.
I thought it was about time we all met.
I remember everything you tell me.
The reason for your failure is that you did not try hard enough.
He dressed like a girl.
Don't you think this is ridiculous?
The baby is asleep.
I'm left-handed.
His novel sold well.
Where did you get that piece of wire?
She applied a bandage to the wound.
They are the same age.
I wish Tom would hurry.
I don't think the post office is open yet.
What are you guys talking about?
I felt cheated.
Get off my back!
I hate that so much.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Do you want to cancel the meeting?
Divide this line into twenty equal parts.
My uncle has a house in Italy.
Set a thief to catch a thief.
I think they like you.
You can watch television.
Please turn on the radio.
Where is Tom sleeping?
He comes from a small but wealthy town.
Will you please let me go now?
A few minutes later, the telephone rang.
Tom has a lot of money in the bank.
This fish is delicious.
They're all lying.
I watched an old movie on TV.
I didn't think you were needed.
I hate my boss.
I don't have time to be bothered by such small things.
Are you saying that my life is in danger?
What have you done with my luggage?
What's the tallest building in Boston?
I hope I haven't woken you up.
It happened just the way you predicted.
Did you hear that sound?
I just want you to be OK.
Everything went as planned.
Their rooms are always clean.
She advised him to cut down on smoking, but he didn't think that he could.
He is not what he seems.
How much did the tickets cost you?
I finished reading the book last night.
They invited them to dinner.
Tom said that wasn't the case.
I had a cat named Cookie.
Get rid of the gun.
He works with me at the office.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
I entered the museum through the wrong gate. I should have been more careful.
His name is known to me.
I felt the floor shake.
It's raining again.
He hurried past me without stopping to speak.
She's a dog.
It's not a matter of price.
Yesterday a truck hit this wall.
Have you tried this water?
Tom is a sleepwalker.
There are some differences between British English and American English.
I want you to get some rest.
I lost my purse on my way to school.
If I had known your email address, I would've written.
We couldn't help feeling sorry for her.
Don't leave.
What happens when we run out of water?
I can hardly make out what he says.
Tom is in the garden pulling weeds.
I'm good at science.
He is planning to develop his business.
We don't even know if it's true.
Your hair's beautiful.
We all have stomachaches.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Why are we laughing?
We're doing what we want to do.
She spends all her time thinking about boys.
This might be the last time we ever see each other.
My heart almost stopped.
Somebody has to be held accountable for his death.
I'd like to book three seats.
Why do you like it?
I know where the key is.
Don't eat the fruit in the bowl on the table. It's plastic.
He is known as a great painter.
You're pulling my leg.
Wait a little longer.
It was a great trip.
Don't touch this!
Are you still interested?
Let's establish some ground rules.
That sounds like a reasonable demand.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
I just smiled.
Several roads are closed.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
I can't save you this time.
The sirens went off.
Tom spoke louder than usual.
Are things going well?
The crown prince is the one who is to succeed to the throne.
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter.
She couldn't keep from crying.
Tom slept on an inflatable mattress.
I can't believe this is all happening.
Tom is an inspector.
We all learn by experience.
They are much taller than us.
She braked hard when she saw a child run out into the road.
Don't put the wallet on the top of the heater.
Tom is fluent in French.
Are you about done?
Tom died at home.
His face turned white.
There's a package for you on the table.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
I really appreciate your company.
We're going west.
He wants you to come home.
Didn't anyone question you?
Tom had lipstick all over his face.
I was late for class.
He soon betrayed his ignorance.
I thought you were hungry.
You don't know what you're doing.
My parents are in Australia.
Give me the key.
Go put some clean clothes on.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
You're temperamental.
There is no telling when they will come.
I've got everything I need right here.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
If it were not for water, we could not live.
Why were you laughing?
Who will look after the baby?
Tom is very unpredictable.
His temperature is normal.
You know that your English is good when people stop complimenting you on how good your English is.
A day without laughter is a day wasted.
I've never seen you like this.
I want you to say you're not going back to Boston.
How are your grades?
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
You'll never leave this town.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
Now fix that.
Did you try playing that song on your guitar?
I could have prevented this.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
It's much too cold to swim.
I'm here to ask for your help.
I felt sorry for her when I heard her story.
I still have some work to do.
Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
My wife is a doctor.
Don't forget that Tom is blind.
Be attentive.
It's still raining.
Unlock the door.
I don't want to fight.
I'd like to know the exact time.
Let me die.
Some children play video games all the time.
She cremated him against his wishes.
I want to leave this city and never come back.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Can you tell me what Tom said?
There's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof.
This song reminds me of someone I used to know.
You can't pull the wool over my eyes.
Do you know whose car that is?
She complained about my low salary.
You have little to gain and much to lose.
They're dangerous.
We must go.
I decided to subscribe to the magazine.
You don't look very good.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
That dog doesn't bite.
Tom has done the best he can do.
He is lazy.
I could swim faster when I was young.
I want an explanation.
Neither of us could've done that alone.
He's known for that.
The meeting was held here.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
She is a reliable person.
I'd like you to leave immediately.
Where is my newspaper?
Windy this morning, isn't it?
This is not what we want.
I need to find a new job.
I am grateful to you for your help.
Could I have money for my piano lesson?
I'm persevering.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
He attributed the accident to the bad weather.
What does your son want to be when he grows up?
There is a park near my house.
Knowing is one thing, teaching quite another.
I have an apology to make.
She kissed him.
I must find some new friends.
Have you ever been a teacher?
This house has a solid foundation.
The cattle starved to death.
I suppose you'll be needing this.
For the moment there's nothing in particular I need to be doing.
I like these.
I'm sure I've met that man somewhere, but I don't remember who he is.
We've already eliminated half the possibilities.
They're in the garden.
She's my daughter.
That's simply not true.
I think Tom is hurt.
I wish you luck.
She was busy with the housework.
We know all this already, Tom.
He is a spoiled child.
Benjamin Franklin was an American politician and inventor.
I don't think I can do this.
He inherited an old wooden chest.
Tom will be away for at least a week.
When did you buy it?
I just can't understand you sometimes.
The customer is not always right.
Beauty is subjective.
There's something in the box.
His bicycle is different from this one.
I did write to him.
Do not disobey the rules.
I finally understand the basic principles of calculus.
I love you people.
I think you're in my seat.
He goes there three times a week.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
There are no flowers growing on Mars.
That's going to take some time.
I can't tell you his name, but I can tell you where he lives.
You nearly died.
I want more detailed information.
Tom wanted Mary to stay at home with the children.
Tom was tense.
Now is not the time.
He seems to have been rich.
The accident happened the day before yesterday.
We were close.
I really, really need it.
How many people do you think we should invite to our party?
That's your duty.
That's pretty strange.
She earns 30 dollars per day.
I really enjoyed last night.
Tom should leave.
She is in her hotel now.
Tom is still dangerous.
The secret got out.
We've done a lot.
Where were you yesterday?
What're you all dressed up for?
Did anybody else notice this?
I'd like one more blanket.
It appears to me that you put on my hat by mistake.
I never told you to lie.
She is what one would call a cultured woman.
That was a stroke of luck.
Tom doesn't want to discourage Mary.
You're drunk.
You look perfect.
She is out of danger.
It's part of the system.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
What will the neighbors think?
Take this medicine after meals.
I was elected.
Tom and his wife have just had a baby.
He shooed the flies away.
Check it out!
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Not only does Tom play the harmonica, he plays the guitar, too.
Go home now.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
Carbon dating was performed on the sample to determine its age.
I have no strong opinion about the matter, so whatever the majority thinks is good is OK with me.
You have a pretty good memory.
Why are you so concerned?
I've been waiting here for him since this morning.
He speaks two languages besides English.
Is it convenient for you if I come at 6 p.m.?
I can hear something.
London, where I live, used to be famous for its fog.
The game was called off on account of the rain.
Do you really hide your money under the mattress?
What do you need the money for?
My job is giving me a stomachache.
I just have a few questions.
Would you like go out for a drink after work?
This is what we want to know.
Tom has changed a lot since high school.
If I were you, I would ignore it.
Did I win?
Please tell me you're joking.
It's still a big risk.
They're not alone.
I'm obedient.
I'll teach you how to drive a car.
The baby is one day old.
She has a cat and two dogs.
Did you start the dishwasher?
I'll do whatever I can to encourage Tom to stay in school.
This is like fighting someone with one arm tied behind your back.
This word is also French in origin.
He spoke highly of you.
Did I wake you?
I know Tom doesn't love you.
You should know better.
Tom believed it.
A lot still remains to be done.
When you've finished reading that book, I'd like to read it.
I was impatient for her arrival.
How did you think it would go?
Do you have a dog?
Sometimes I get jealous.
I have a few French books.
Could you take this, please?
Those agenda items were discussed together.
We were too late.
Beware of falling rocks!
I really like that guy.
We need to weigh our options.
I'll kill the both of you.
It's just a game.
I'll go ahead.
The boss has a good opinion of your work.
You'd be amazed how many times I've told Tom not to do that.
I took the elevator to the fourth floor.
I always root for the underdog.
Let me get you something to drink.
She showed me her new car.
This is not funny.
Is he dead?
I'm just waiting for a friend.
She's accustomed to getting up early.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
Tom has worked for me for three years.
After the hatchet job my boss did on my proposal, I'm not sure how long I want to keep on working here.
I'm depressed.
Tom was killed by an explosion.
The Japanese live mainly on rice.
You don't have to sing.
Are you unlucky?
I went there to meet him.
It appears to be working.
This painting has already been sold.
You know everything.
See you again.
I'm not insane.
Neither of us wants to get married.
It's his word against hers.
This is something new.
This is my bicycle.
I'm very poor.
Now, it's time to celebrate.
I was in Boston last weekend.
I spoke with her for one hour.
I guess it's OK.
I found a pair of sunglasses by the swimming pool.
There are holes in the roof.
Who wants some hot chocolate?
Here it is.
I wish to go to Hawaii.
Tom asked me to take Mary to the zoo.
Did you put it somewhere?
Do you like Indonesian food?
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
I ought to punch you for saying that.
I'm doing it myself.
Please move your bicycle out of here.
They were afraid of being overheard.
It started as a hobby.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Please go to the bank.
We were very careful.
I really love what I do.
I'd like to offer you a job.
Save your long-winded explanations for someone else.
You can't blame yourself.
I just wanted to play baseball.
I need more information on this matter.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
Don't put anything on top of the box.
You have my word.
Are you religious?
No matter how much you try to convince people that chocolate is vanilla, it'll still be chocolate, even though you may manage to convince yourself and a few others that it's vanilla.
Do you have a temperature?
The cough syrup has a licorice flavoring.
The noise outside his window prevented him from sleeping.
Put the eggs into the boiling water.
Where does all this come from?
Show me everything.
We weren't able to buy tickets, so we didn't go to the concert.
May I have a look at your ticket?
The guy who hit you is at the front door.
I'm sorry about your loss.
We regret his death.
She spoke wisely.
It really bugged me.
I'm in bed.
Could you check the tires?
I asked my mother if breakfast was ready.
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
I'm tired of dancing.
Your honesty is refreshing.
Where did you go?
I told everyone to duck.
Amsterdam is famous for its canals.
I keep a journal.
Where's your hat?
You weren't serious, were you?
I ran into your mother in the library.
Have you ever kissed another guy?
She studied English in the morning.
Tom didn't commit the crimes he's been accused of.
How long has it been since your divorce?
I require your advice.
Tom wanted Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I have to get some sleep.
His car was seriously damaged.
It's exactly as I expected.
Is this French or English?
I didn't tell anyone.
Why are you mad at me?
I demanded that they be allowed to leave.
I'll make you happy.
I've always wanted to read that book.
Is Tom doing OK?
I have a good sense of smell.
Do you really want it?
He left everything to chance.
Are you sure there's nothing else to drink?
You will have a new sister.
He did not understand her joke.
Do you enjoy living like this?
Tom is his real name, isn't it?
Last summer, I spent three weeks in Boston.
Are you looking for something?
No one was supposed to know about that.
If you eat too much, you'll become fat.
I want to be noticed.
I like your hat.
He went aboard the plane.
See below.
I'm glad you came today.
To put it bluntly, he's mistaken.
He can't be an honest man.
He showed his photograph album to me.
I want to live close to the station.
Where did you meet your boyfriend?
It's bound to rain.
Go with the flow.
I'm not stopping you.
That job gave him little gratification.
Mars is a planet.
Where are you going?
I want you to know that.
I really hate this.
He received a lot of praise.
Could you change my room to one with a view of the ocean?
She selected a blue dress from the wardrobe.
That's not funny at all.
Tom burst into laughter.
It was so cold that he was shivering.
He can also speak Russian.
Tom has chosen you.
This is my car.
An idea occurred to me.
She shot him.
He used to eat out every day, but now he can't afford it.
I think it's time for me to organize a party.
We missed the plane.
I have a tight schedule this weekend.
Everything worked.
Bring me the phone, Tom.
Let's send Tom a sympathy card.
You can't be sure of that.
I don't know anything about Japan.
We just arrived at the station.
This coffee is cold.
I know that Tom is colorblind.
We're engaged.
Don't tell me you stole it.
Don't forget to put on some sunscreen.
Don't come near me.
He is liked by everybody.
Let me remind you of something.
Have you ever seen the man in this photo?
He sometimes watches TV.
I hope everything is okay.
The sooner you leave, the better.
I used to like folk music.
I'm not a hero.
I'm eating lunch.
She sent me a present in return for my advice.
She looked better than last time.
I just want to be different.
We prepared snacks beforehand.
I must go.
If I had enough money, I could do that.
Do you want me to go home?
She gave him the brush off.
I thought they'd heard us.
The house is painted white.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
We should've bought three bottles of wine.
I'm celebrating.
Do you think you'll be here tomorrow?
This book isn't very good.
They believe in God.
I can't stand being treated like a child.
I want to hear more.
I think it's time for me to move on.
When you get to be my age, you'll understand what I mean.
I'll talk to him at the earliest possible moment.
Does it offend you?
I think you went too far.
I suggest we change clothes first.
The heavy snowfall prevented our train from leaving on time.
I shouldn't have eaten the whole bag of potato chips.
Let me try.
I need a pen and paper.
She stabbed him in the back.
You can always quit the job.
I expect to be back next Monday.
Will there be anything else?
A wise man would not act in that way.
Given her inexperience, she has done well.
Give me a week.
I just want to check something.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
I'm proud of you.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
I think we can handle that.
Could you please pull the weeds and water the flowers?
I'm not trying to impress anyone.
Turn the lights out now.
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
Are you enjoying this?
It is terrible weather today.
Hundreds of people were waiting outside the ticket office.
We flew nonstop from Osaka to Los Angeles.
I can't sleep with all this noise.
It's mine, not hers.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
You can't blame me.
She's demented.
Do you know who they are?
My father is very tired.
I never said I was an artist.
She always keeps her promises.
Tom was upstairs.
I speak French a little.
That's what I need to do.
She was satisfied with the result.
I'm almost done. Just give me a minute.
Is Tom ready for this?
Tom seems to be unable to interact normally with other people.
Do you like dogs?
Now, let's discuss our other problem.
I tell you the truth.
He wiped his nose on his sleeve.
I ride my bike to work.
I want you back today.
You'd be better off without me.
He is beyond help.
None of their promises have been kept.
Tom's ideas seemed crazy.
I thought you went to your room to sleep.
They're idiots.
The employees voted on the manager's proposal.
It went off smoothly.
The seventh day of the week is Saturday.
It's way too cold to swim.
She can play the piano.
Don't think about it. Do it.
It's hotter here in the valley than in the mountains.
I hope that it rains tomorrow.
You aren't my mother.
You're the only person I know that never complains about the food here.
What are you doing?
The more worthless the plant, the more rapid and splendid is its growth.
I'm not a psychic.
I get a three percent commission on anything I sell.
Is it your fault or ours?
Please ask Tom to leave.
Have you finished writing your composition?
We can't have you working for us.
I only eat vegetables that I grow myself.
This plan requires secrecy.
Please write down what he says.
Change is needed.
The room is too small.
You must pay in advance.
I'd like to be your friend.
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it.
I found him a job.
He received a registered letter.
This is a friend of mine.
We need to know what happened.
What do you feel most proud of?
How would you like your eggs?
I like spending time with her.
Why do you want to do that anyway?
The baby is sleeping in the cradle.
It might rain. We should take an umbrella.
No one is too old to learn.
They're going to the war.
Can I have some more rice, please?
Do you really think we can win?
Who do you think that guy is?
How much sugar do you use?
Tom is our best investigator.
I've seen them all.
This is a picture of the ship I was on.
He was declared guilty.
Here are the books you asked for.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
That's a pretty strange-looking bracelet you're wearing.
That will buy us time.
It is really time for us to go.
All hope is gone.
Did you hear the news?
I'm getting old.
I'm always happy.
I want some help.
Why can't animals talk?
We used to do a lot of things together.
I thought he was my brother.
Have you found what you were looking for?
She put on dark glasses to protect her eyes from the sun.
That's what I'm here for.
Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take him to do that.
Why don't we drop by to see her?
I'd like to take a look outside.
These pencils need sharpening.
Answer my question.
Is that your car?
They hung streamers from the ceiling in preparation for the party.
My husband is a good man.
Do you mind if I sit?
Are you a typist?
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
I like wearing old clothes.
No one is asking you.
I had to walk here because my car broke down.
I felt like an idiot.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
You're bossy.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
After they had finished their work, they went out.
This is by far the best seafood restaurant in this area.
How did I get into this?
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
This is outlandish.
Is there anything else you'd like?
Tom is a good teacher.
That's a pretty dress you have on.
Why don't you slow down a little bit?
Look at this picture.
He made sure nobody could see her.
Do you want some of these fries?
Many health specialists say that you should eat three meals a day.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
But I was careful.
Mary is quite attractive.
I'm pretty sure Tom wasn't there.
Is he really coming?
It seems logical to me.
Will you watch the superbowl?
May I use your car today?
I am so sick.
What inspires you most?
I don't know what to say about that.
I want to learn Hebrew.
They're talking.
I have no wish to live in a large city.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
Do you live alone?
It's really not important.
I hard-boiled an egg.
I had met him many times before then.
I want you to get in your car.
I don't think I can do it.
You're a horrible singer.
I was happy to hear the news.
You don't have to explain.
It worked.
What's the fax number for this hotel?
I knew that Tom was scared.
My gums bleed whenever I floss my teeth.
Tom tried to be polite.
Don't drink too much, okay?
I think it's too cold to swim.
How do you plan on paying for that?
I have to get away from this place.
I'm not ready to go yet.
I leave this evening.
Why have you been avoiding me?
When was the last time you saw the cat?
You can't just sit here all day.
I had to look after you.
You can't keep this a secret.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I don't think I'd like you as a friend.
I just got off duty.
How would you reword this sentence to make it sound more natural?
I'd like you to see this.
I was surprised by what I learned.
He got bored quickly.
Tom is the boy on the right.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Did you murder Tom?
I just got here a few hours ago.
If you're not happy, quit.
You've got to be kidding me!
We surrendered.
This work is simple enough for a child to do.
Why don't you go ahead?
This isn't safe.
I want to do what's best for both of us.
We appreciate the advice.
I don't feel so good.
Why are you so scared to talk to him?
When will you return?
You warned me, but I didn't listen.
I think they know us.
Tom is busy writing a speech.
You're too suspicious about everything.
Have they spotted you?
You're just the person I want to speak to.
No extremely fat man has ever attempted such a thing.
Everyone loves him.
Her work is to wash the dishes.
Are you in a bad mood?
Mary is not only beautiful, she's smart, too.
Where did you put my keys?
Disneyland was built in 1955.
He tricked me.
Twelve years old is old for a dog.
What a scream!
Why did you lie?
We associate Egypt with the Nile.
I have an alibi.
Call a plumber.
This is all I know.
I want to do everything I'm expected to do.
Be careful not to make any mistakes.
He was in America at that time.
I've learned not to put much stock in what he says.
How tall you are!
I come from a family of doctors.
Are you still not convinced?
I love your eyes.
You can run very fast, can't you?
How could you not know?
How about playing golf tomorrow?
Let's go to a Chinese restaurant.
Something's going on here.
How is your dad?
The old woman got hurt when she fell.
He only thinks about himself.
I sat at the bar.
I still need to renew my passport.
You must always keep your hands clean.
You're skinny.
He looks quite sophisticated for his age.
You must be in love.
How often do you brush your teeth?
Please be quiet.
We know our problems.
We were so proud.
I can't give up.
I can see you're in a good mood.
What reason did he give for being so late?
What did you do with my luggage?
It was very ugly.
Japanese is harder than English.
I'm not going to touch it.
His girlfriend is Japanese.
Let's play volleyball.
I want this.
My children were born in Boston.
Wasn't he your boyfriend?
I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
I take back what I said.
He sat with his legs crossed.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
You'll understand when you have children.
Tom is a bit strange.
I bought this at a garage sale.
You always sing.
How long does it take from here to Tokyo Station by car?
See you in a few minutes.
I want this garbage out of here.
We'll be eating soon.
I have something I want to tell you.
The floor was covered with blood.
You ought not to have done that.
The restaurant was far from the station.
All three were killed.
Just trust me.
They were really unlucky.
Do you pluck your eyebrows?
I had a late lunch.
Go away before they see you here.
We were kids together.
I feel lost without you.
Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
This film is a masterpiece.
You are a bad person.
We have to consider the problem in the light of cultural differences.
Darkness is the absence of light.
I saw Tom kissing another girl.
In any case, I'll call you tomorrow.
Did you shoot Tom?
Tom went to his study and locked the door.
I love the way you kiss.
My country needs me.
Tom sharpened a pencil.
Not doing one's work properly may be worse than not doing it at all.
Is that what you really want to do?
We did it yesterday.
I'd love to sing for you.
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He works as a gym teacher.
Give me some time to think it over.
During my early teens, I was not always on the best of terms with my parents.
They did not clap for us.
My son loves rockets.
I love camels.
You can't be too careful in situations like this.
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
Stand up straight.
You sound really angry.
I don't like the coffee.
That was a foolish decision.
I continued singing.
What country were you born in?
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones.
You don't sound too sure.
Did anybody see you?
You don't know what it's like to not have enough to eat.
She advised him to lose weight.
If you change your hairstyle, you could look ten years younger.
He's a goal keeper.
You must help your mother.
He's bulked up quite a bit since he's been going to the gym.
Stop hitting your brother.
What do you do on Fridays?
You have to obey your parents.
What if something went wrong?
I spoke slowly so that they could understand me.
Thanks for your explanation.
Don't delete this file.
I abhor spiders.
We're getting out of here. The storm is coming.
She was a charming woman.
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
I'm not the one who told Tom to leave.
You aren't my mother.
We'll attend.
You need a reality check.
I suppose I could wait a little longer.
There are some cases where this rule doesn't apply.
Tom and Mary are getting married in three months.
Listening to music is a great way to relax.
I think we've seen this movie before.
I can verify that.
You can't take that with you.
Where was this photo taken?
I'm not interested in that.
I'm proud of you all.
I'm joking, of course.
I'm opening my presents now.
Where is the boy?
Tom brushed his daughter's hair.
I need to know your answer by Friday.
Do you have any water?
We're no longer working for Tom.
The only one who enjoys a crowded subway car is a pickpocket.
Excuse me. May I get by?
Tom gave up smoking.
Your office is nicer than mine.
My mother has gone to the beauty shop.
My cat loves shrimp.
I hope he sees this.
You don't have the time.
I can get to work faster by walking than by taking the car.
Tom doesn't want to move.
I like the kind of music that Tom plays.
That bridge is very beautiful.
Can you tell us what happened to you?
I was concerned.
Does Tom sing well?
Your son must be quite tall by now.
It must've been difficult for you to do that.
The whole house was shaking.
Tom painted the fence.
Strong winds stripped the tree of its leaves.
I couldn't make myself understood in English.
I can't let you in there.
I'm closing the door.
I may have seen that girl somewhere.
I just want you to be happy.
This is why he got angry with you.
You should carry out your promises.
Sooner or later, I'll probably get tired of doing this.
Since this is important, I'd like you to attend to it yourself.
Tom's computer was in his car.
I love you more and more every day.
You're not a teenager yet.
I waited until the last minute.
Here, have a taste.
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
He must have left the water running.
You're not sick.
Do you work on Monday?
Are you allergic to anything else?
She weeded the garden.
I can't do this myself.
It's there to the left.
The arrow indicates the way to go.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
I feared the worst.
I had to get everyone's attention.
You're a funny guy.
I couldn't have done it better myself.
She asked him out on a date.
You don't get it, do you?
I caught five fish yesterday.
Tom hates waiting in line.
I suggest that your son come to our party.
I wasn't ready for what was about to happen.
I hope it's better tomorrow.
Tom didn't look very well.
Turn on the ignition.
I've got to see a dentist.
I think I really learned a lot.
I'd like to go to college.
Would it be ethical to sacrifice one person to save many?
What language were they speaking?
I will do anything for you.
I want one, but not this one.
One must observe the rules.
Why were you absent yesterday?
I'll meet you at the bus station.
She misses her father.
I wonder why Tom is lying.
I'm the victim here.
He smiled at me and got on the train.
Whose side are you on?
I want to know where you plan to live.
I just wanted clarification.
Do it delicately.
We're going to eat right now.
The room smelled bad.
I live about a mile from here.
Tom changed jobs.
Do you think it'll be easy to find the kind of job you want?
It doesn't seem like it's going to stop raining.
Don't tell anybody.
Tom is tireless.
We're paying.
You never arrive on time.
We need to get something done.
I was often at odds with my parents.
Call me if you find something.
If only I'd known then what I know now.
The youth was arrested for being involved in a riot.
Tom has been told not to do that here.
Get some sleep, okay?
I didn't know you then.
I broke up with Tom.
Tom has a dentist appointment.
I fed the leftovers to my dog.
I'm not the same fool I was fifteen years ago.
I'm really tired today.
Have a little dignity.
It's sort of strange.
The flowers brightened up the room.
This desk is better than that one.
Crime is increasing.
You have a watch.
The problem was I couldn't speak French.
I'm ugly.
I'd like to get married to someone like you.
They saw him enter the room.
Both men were executed.
You're Tom's friend, aren't you?
I felt responsible.
Tom thought about what Mary said.
Beethoven was a great composer.
I knew you'd say that.
Tom told me he was single.
Do I look happy to you?
Help yourself to the strawberry jam.
Make it smaller.
He has twice as many books as I do.
She was stupid enough to go out with him.
He fell ill because he ate too much.
The two sides negotiated for days.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
The ball hit him on the left side of the head.
Are you sure that you want to quit your job?
There were more than fifty girls at the party.
You never told me your girlfriend's name.
The factory uses many complicated machines.
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
Finding his office was easy.
That car is quite new.
Which one will he choose?
I do things at my own pace.
Why are you worried?
Apparently I'm adopted.
Both of the windows were broken.
Bring your children along.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
My neighbor's son made fun of my daughter today at school.
I apologized for having been late for school.
If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it.
Mary's husband is rich.
I'm a truck driver.
He can't cook very well.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
It's not just about the money.
What do you base your theory on?
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
Are you going to work until 10:00?
I don't even like fish.
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
His condition got worse every day.
Have you already signed the contract?
Tom lives in a house on the edge of the village.
I just don't want to believe it.
What is your idea of a good time?
I'm rational.
Don't be afraid to experiment.
Luck's on my side today.
Why don't we share a room?
What a shame to just endure life rather than enjoying it.
Are you leaving soon?
I really didn't have time.
I'm going to fix some dinner.
I think what impressed me most was the way Tom could talk to just about anyone.
I rested.
I have to do that now.
This is infuriating.
Nobody cares for me.
Will you eat dinner?
His mother is an English teacher.
I never thought it could happen to me.
My wisdom teeth are coming in.
The dog bit the man.
I'd like to know where Tom hid his key.
Tom tasted the soup and said it was delicious.
I wanted you to do that.
Are you coming to the party tonight?
I've seen it with my own eyes.
Do you pluck your eyebrows?
I'm not sure I have time for that.
Tom doesn't know you.
I thought we had eaten everything in the house, but I found another box of crackers.
I wish she would stop playing that stupid music.
She called him.
Do you have any idea who did this?
Let's go out to eat.
I wasn't hired.
I have to pay more attention to myself.
Where are the showers?
She said that it might be true.
I can't dance either.
I am grateful for your help.
It's possible that Tom was able to convince Mary to do his laundry for him.
Welcome home.
I'm certain that he'll come.
He takes a walk every morning.
I ate a light lunch.
He seldom, if ever, reads a book.
How much is this umbrella?
You should be more reasonable.
I say that all the time.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
I know exactly where I am.
Please try again.
I've never felt like this before.
I'll try to keep this brief.
She used to play tennis every Sunday.
I'd like to run a few more tests.
When did the robbery happen?
Can you ride a bicycle?
He's three years older than she is.
I thought Tom was a musician.
The truth finally came out at his trial.
I don't like leaving the job half done.
You're not telling me the truth.
You need to be more aggressive.
He pulled my shirt.
A good password should be difficult to guess, but easy to remember.
Haven't you had your dinner?
The meeting is all over.
He was robbed of all his money.
What exactly am I paying for?
He has the backing of a certain politician.
I'm glad you're early.
Tom told me he was going to commit suicide.
I know Tom will be supportive.
He went there, never to return.
Supper is getting cold.
Don't be disgusting.
These allegations are false.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
I didn't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I was allowed to take a week off.
You gotta get more organized.
Let's eat out tonight.
That happened to me this morning.
I don't think you can sell that.
I'm here to stop you from making the biggest mistake of your life.
I cannot put up with his bad manners any longer.
What's your favorite cartoon?
Tom helps anyone who asks for help.
It was not easy to get a lot of money in a short time.
I'm a teacher.
If you don't water the plants, they will wither.
Will you take a personal check?
I'd really like it if we could be friends.
My wife has faults. None the less, I love her.
Many people are still missing.
What do you have to say about that?
Take a little nap on the sofa.
This movie is incredibly stupid.
Tom will be arriving any moment.
She was asked to the party.
He must be an honest man.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
They don't make them like they used to.
Tom reads slowly.
That will cost thirty euros.
Let her sleep.
It all makes sense now.
He is fluent in French.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary was.
You should free those animals from the cage.
Give me the salt, please.
I missed you so much.
I'm glad you came over.
They sat in a circle.
Is it your fault or ours?
I know Tom is a greedy man.
I've been writing letters all day long.
I do not mind what you do.
I think a part-time job is a good experience.
Do you have a twin sister?
Save it on the external hard drive.
I was all by myself.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Tom rang the bell.
There is a lot of work to do.
We kept in touch.
I'm saving money for my old age.
Let's wrap this up and go home.
We're not fools.
He believed that blacks could win their fight for equal rights without violence.
I don't have time for a vacation this year.
Give her this letter when she comes.
Something you should know about me is that I'm very much a country boy at heart.
Nobody has a landline these days.
It is questionable whether this data can be relied on.
No way!
May I be of assistance?
This must never happen again.
Is he done using the telephone?
I tried to call you last night, but you didn't answer.
I'm cool.
The river flows between the two countries.
Tom has been taken hostage.
She pointed her finger at him.
I can't lift the sack either.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
We go to the same school.
You have good reason to be angry.
I want to kiss you.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I want those reports on my desk within the hour.
I hate fanatics.
It's business as usual.
Just throw your bicycle in the back of the truck and I'll drive you home.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Don't try to do too much.
I saw a figure approaching in the distance.
Aren't you a banker?
I have a high fever.
She's heating the water.
You're in the right place.
That's sort of nice.
What's for lunch?
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
Is there something that you want to tell me?
I've never seen that before.
I can't imagine what it must've been like.
Tom jumped off the diving board.
Have you done all your homework?
I still say we should've helped Tom.
They lost everything.
His paintings seem strange to me.
The lion is king of beasts.
I thought it was lunchtime.
I can't tell you anything yet.
You have a good sense of humor.
You have a lot of nerve!
What do you think happens then?
No one's watching me.
He is about forty.
He is too young to go there alone.
If you keep trying, you will make progress.
He has a nice personality.
Tom was killed by a land mine.
Her English is perfect.
We're very grateful for your hospitality.
Have you been to Cairo?
They're all thieves.
A red dress made her stand out.
She made many mistakes in typing the report.
I dream about you quite often.
I'm as shocked as you are.
They don't usually take hostages.
You have a habit of exaggerating everything.
I appreciate it.
Tom's packing.
As soon as he graduated, he went to work in his father's general store.
Will you be in Boston this weekend?
In addition to being a famous physicist, he is a great novelist.
The teacher didn't let the students ask any questions.
Why don't you sit here?
Tom was found dead in his car.
Tom is defenseless.
She always buys expensive clothes.
You must treat them with more consideration.
I came across an article in the newspaper about your new project.
I'm one of the thirty people who need to do that.
I'm very much in favor of this.
I don't think about you in that way.
Show me some respect.
I'll call you a cab.
She has put on weight recently.
Is that your mother?
It was shorter than he expected.
I can't do it alone.
Hopefully, the weather will be good.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
Do you think we should just wait and hope it changes?
Consider the following scenario.
He fell asleep immediately.
Are you drinking?
I'll make you proud of me.
Get on the bus.
He tried in vain to solve the problem.
Could I borrow a saw?
Is there a rule that says I can't do this?
I'm astonished.
Who's your teacher?
I'm introverted.
Are you jealous?
He has a lot of original ideas.
That's not how it works.
Tom may never be able to walk again.
I have difficulty chewing.
You are too sensitive to criticism.
I'll always be here to help you.
We both forgot to do our homework.
He doesn't have any friends to play with.
A group of young men are playing handball in the playground.
Tom said he wasn't interested in doing that.
Congratulations on your anniversary.
How much time do we have to finish this?
The early bird gets the worm.
All the students are studying English.
Your phone's ringing.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
You're not the first one to say that.
I could be next.
I don't know what you want me to say.
I am going to study.
He is strong as a horse.
This ship was ten meters long.
You have a lot of time.
You're famous.
Are you here alone?
The swimming pool is closed due to the storm.
You must be very proud of your son.
He kept on telling lies.
I can't permit this to continue.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
She demanded to see the manager.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
As is often the case with her, she was late for the meeting this afternoon.
The wall was covered with pictures of gunshot victims.
I am not romantic at all.
Let's see if Tom can stay away.
May I open a can?
I wasn't able to escape.
She was absent from class.
You should have left half an hour earlier.
There is no message.
How do you know you can trust Tom?
I'm not obese.
They attacked the enemy.
Will the work be finished by tomorrow?
It's the largest in the world.
Tom and Mary are both professors.
He had a hard time making himself understood at the meeting.
You should give up smoking.
Does that satisfy you?
What time do we leave tomorrow?
I saw the car hit a man.
Come quickly. It's urgent.
You're not in charge.
They are not enemies, but friends.
Tom is an architect.
We're going to play tennis.
How horrible!
What if he comes back now?
The problem is not settled yet.
It's not funny.
You liked that movie, didn't you?
Tom refused to tell us anything.
I had two copies of the book.
They all laughed at their error.
How can we prevent that from happening?
Where did they go?
I've asked you repeatedly to do that.
Nobody can believe in you more than yourself.
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria.
How do you not understand?
I'm speechless.
We're still investigating the cause.
We have to save him immediately.
I went with them so that I could guide them around Nagasaki.
You have overstepped your authority.
You know where I'm going.
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
You were there, weren't you?
Are there any questions?
Change is scary.
Tom always talks about Mary.
I really like your music.
He couldn't take it any longer.
We haven't really thought about it yet.
It's the big one.
You are blinded by love.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
Luna is a reliable person.
You've got no alibi for the day of the murder.
Pay attention on the road.
I'm a married woman.
No one told me.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
Do you smell something?
Tom arrived safely.
I have no idea why it is so.
You don't sound very surprised.
Do you really believe that Tom is reliable?
He ran into debt.
Feeling the house shake, I ran outside.
I know why he did it.
I grew up in this small town.
He seems to know us.
I'd suggest the following change.
This room is cramped.
How much time do we have?
Tom gave Mary all the money he had.
Tom told Mary about his imaginary friend.
You are not a coward.
I am sorry for what I did.

He's probably wrong.
I'm sure that's wrong.
He's tickled pink.
I can't bear the thought of losing you.

He's raking it in.
I gained back the weight I'd lost over the summer.
Why are you being mean to me?
Do you want to come over tonight?
She hasn't heard the news yet.
I want a new dress.
You're no longer allowed to speak.
Tom spent three years behind bars.
It certainly looks that way.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
What do I mean to you?
Stay away from my daughter!
The murder charge was reduced to manslaughter.
Tell me what you know about the incident.
I can't find my purse.
I'd like to borrow this.
Think about it tonight.
I don't even know why.
He took off his hat.
Are you winning?
I didn't think you'd leave so early.
It seemed to be a good idea.
When are you going to get married?
He was in time for school.
Where did the money go?
I don't want to lose my boyfriend.
I want for you and me to be happy.
Tom's French is much better than Mary's.
I'll buy whatever Tom wants me to buy for him.
Do you want to get us both killed?
Some men don’t know that.
The old man was starved to death.
Have you slept?
They replaced coal with oil.
Be more careful from now on.
This apple tastes sour.
How did you find us?
I'm still an amateur.
I'm proud of that.
We have to go.
I should turn in. I need my beauty sleep you know.
You should be real proud of yourself.
You look a little young to be a teacher.
I locked myself out of my apartment.
A watered down compromise resolution is better than none at all.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
It was a stupid idea.
Are these all the same?
We had fine weather on that day.
I can't get her out of my mind.
You can do this.
I was only saying my prayers.
I thought she wouldn't notice that he wasn't here.
This is it.
Do you need anything?
I don't have much interest in cooking.
I don't know what he's trying to say.
He's been trying to contact you for weeks.
No one knows the reason.
He is absorbed in reading detective novels.
I want that.
I felt myself lifted up.
The weather is terrible today.
Be punctual.
I liked working with you.
Let me help you.
It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
I just need to know what happened.
I know almost nothing about you.
Some people think that it is difficult for a native speaker of English to learn Chinese, but I disagree.
Let's go to the theater together.
The cat is hiding under the couch.
What's your impression of the United States?
We're all crazy.
Tom doesn't understand why we did that.
I'm doing my homework.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
That's the main gate.
I hope you're not planning to do that today.
It was a rumor.
When did you tell me that?
He is cranky.
I cry every time I listen to this song.
Today is my birthday.
Please fill out this form.
By the way, did you have any spare time to go sightseeing while you were there?
Do you want me to drive you to the airport?
Do you have some buttermilk?
He is incompetent.
The young girl sighed.
Tom came.
I really have to go.
The doors wouldn't open, so I had to get in through the trunk.
I beg you to let me live.
She lives two doors down.
See you all tomorrow.
I often look up words in that dictionary.
Haven't I already told you about this before?
I could hear everything.
Tom was able to do what the rest of us weren't able to do.
I don't know this neighborhood too well.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
I want you to tell me why you did that.
You have to be prepared.
I need to know where you are.
I love being a teacher.
My grandmother was a farmer.
The answers are all right.
There's something I'd like you to take a look at.
This is my last offer.
Your house is nicer than mine.
Feed the bird.
The doctor will be here in a minute.
Tom might not have a driver's license.
It was a horrible scene.
You could've been hurt.
I didn't try to kill myself.
I'm going to get on the next bus.
They have only one option.
Go away before they see you here.
Tom and Mary both complained about the weather.
The investigation concluded that the police officer had done nothing wrong.
I have a lot of questions.
What's your job?
He seldom, if ever, comes.
Are you guys stupid or something?
You're restless.
Have you found a place to live?
I introduced her to you last week.
Tom didn't know how to do it.
A helicopter flew overhead.
Tom has come up with another good idea.
There must be a spy among us.
Don't breathe a word of it to anyone.
I had nothing to do with it.
Is it cancer?
Rice is cultivated in several parts of the world.
Do I look dead to you?
Don't be afraid.
Where's the train station?
I hid it in my sock drawer.
You have no proof.
What makes you happy?
I don't understand this obsession of yours.
I'd like to have you on our team.
You're not safe here.
I've always wanted to live in this neighborhood.
Apart from a filing tray full of papers on the desk, everything else in the room was on the floor.
I don't have as much money as you think.
Don't take it so literally.
I don't know what we're going to find, but we should find something.
There are a lot of dogs here, aren't there?
I'm content with my salary.
Are you tired of living?
I can swim.
May I look at the menu?
I'm surprised that I don't have to do what you have to do.
They left the problem unsolved.
I'm surprised to see you again.
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
Would you open the door?
When did the concert start?
Who was there that night?
She protested weakly, but ended up joining in with everyone else.
He's a little like his father.
Pray for all of us.
I didn't know I was going to be punished.
You don't sound too sure.
You don't understand what's happening.
Whose camera is this?
He had a lot of money in the bank.
Can you show me around?
They are disappointed in their son.
There's no need to hurry.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
I'll be back right away.
How good are you?
Are you talking shop?
I wanted to thank you for what you did today.
Tom had no sons.
It'd definitely be worth it to expand on your idea.
I have been living here for three years.
He promised me that he would be more careful in the future.
I don't think they're married.
Are you students?
Does anybody recognize him?
I don't speak French.
I figure that there is no point in trying to persuade him.
How stupid he is!
Allied forces were attacking from the west.
Whoever thought of this stupid plan should be fired.
I want you to try it.
She was obliged to marry the old man.
Tom is going to learn how to do that sooner or later.
Did you do this all yourself?
Please get out of my car.
Are you single?
Is that notarized?
How long were you at the party?
You could come and live with me.
The room was very untidy.
He turned pale the instant he saw her.
You must prepare yourself for the worst.
What medications are you taking?
Have you finished?
Prove it to me.
Maybe that's a good idea.
There's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.
I lit the match.
I found my mother busy ironing out some shirts.
Every man has his own strong points.
I'm not tall.
Don't worry. This won't happen again.
If you push this button, the door will open.
Who taught you to write?
Tom seemed disappointed.
I've been trying to get in touch with you for months.
Even a clock that is stopped shows the correct time twice a day.
Do you understand how serious this is?
She did not come until two.
If God is with us, then who is against us?
Let me know what you want to do.
Don't waste ammunition.
Tom certainly wasn't at home when we went to visit him.
Can I make copies?
How did you find me?
Tom was cheerful.
She went shopping.
Tom is a member of the SWAT team.
You need to be more patient.
You'd better do what Tom says.
Let's get cracking!
If it were not for water, no one could live on earth.
I'm unenthusiastic.
I hope you have insurance.
He died yesterday.
I thought Tom was sick.
Tom's dreaming.
The results were very satisfactory.
I'll do my best, I promise you.
He begged for his life.
My success is largely due to your help.
Tom said the decision was his.
I thought he was rich.
Don't disturb me while I'm studying.
Your son is dating my daughter.
She must still be in her twenties.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Half the apples Tom gave me were rotten.
It has begun.
This lady is Indian.
The arrow hit the target.
You are selling him short.
She wriggled her toes.
I must work hard to make up for lost time.
You're very timid.
I was reading a book while walking.
She sat next to him.
We're closed tomorrow.
I didn't get a chance to introduce myself to her.
Our team is five points ahead.
I think we're going to be late.
I'm not thirsty right now.
He's very likely to come.
You don't know what it's like to not have enough to eat.
I couldn't stop crying.
Put on your hat.
I'm glad to be here.
Do you share a room?
Don't you remember anything?
What's your favorite word?
Will you help me with my French homework?
Did you sew this by hand?
She tried to get whatever she wanted.
I need this more than you.
I called Tom up.
We feed our dog three times a day.
I know Tom is unemployed.
I think I understand it.
I miss the hustle and bustle of city life.
I don't believe that's the truth.
Are you coming with us? "Yes, of course!"
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
It's a beautiful picture.
I figured I might be able to help.
You don't have to go.
What's wrong with the way I'm dressed?
Tom could've changed.
I had no one to talk to.
My uncle died of cancer of the stomach yesterday.
Humor me.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
Are you going home by bus?
I've been worried all along.
Can we do that here?
That computer might not work.
I can't save you.
I'd like to know what's going on.
I'm armed.
Tom found an old map.
Your shoes are here.
The administration approved the budget.
This is obviously fake.
Is everything all right?
Tom's lucky.
I'm sincere.
The cow gave birth to a calf with two heads.
They were murdered.
The car's almost out of gas.
Tom and Mary both shook their heads no.
These are bad times.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
Tom asked Mary some questions, but she refused to answer them.
I think they like you.
Tom and Mary know each other well.
Just leave it.
She pulled her sweater over her head.
I love your house.
Tom couldn't find it.
He is absorbed in reading detective novels.
Keep your room clean.
He was like a father to me.
I am thinking about my children.
Be kind to others.
Would you be kind enough to explain it to me?
Did he propose to you?
I wasn't going to buy anything.
I didn't lose much time.
He lives in the western part of town.
That's a good story. The only problem is that it's not true.
You won't be shot.
I heard you are planning to switch majors.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep right away.
I have lived in Boston since 1995.
Where's my ticket?
I am sure of her success.
I'm not quite finished yet.
This tea is too hot to drink.
Let's establish some ground rules.
Luck is blind.
Have you asked the others?
We saw the film and had dinner together.
I had him fix my watch.
Excuse me, but would you please open the window?
I took a day off last week.
I want some information.
We'll cook.
We were friends.
She was wearing an ugly dress.
I'll protect Tom.
How does it help us?
Take a bus.
I will try.
Everybody wants permanent peace.
We need evidence.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice.
Do you really want Tom to do that?
You're not even paying attention.
It's a real challenge.
I figured you weren't coming.
I leave this afternoon.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.
What's your favorite game?
He absconded with the money.
My computer's acting up.
That runs against my principles.
I have got to go now.
I thought I was alone here.
They can't hurt you now.
I won't tolerate it.
You live here alone, don't you?
Thanks for reminding me.
Are they speaking French?
I didn't know what to do with it.
Control is everything.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
Have you been told the reasons why we didn't hire you?
She is being blackmailed by him.
Why do you keep giving him money?
You say I should know him quite well, but as a matter of fact, I was introduced to him only last week.
The house burned down completely.
There's no way Tom can verify the information.
This car was made in Japan.
Could you close the door, please?
What do you plan on doing with the money?
She despises people who lie.
The temperature fell several degrees.
Are you still studying French?
If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it.
I thought you were going to wait for me.
Tom poured himself a tall glass of milk.
We can open the windows.
Is the procedure clear?
I've heard the rumor.
You should eat something a little more nutritious.
I fully intend to return.
Do you ever study in the library?
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
I want to do it right.
Why didn't you ask me sooner?
The food is spoiled.
Are seats available?
They got the prize.
The acting is very good.
Do it somewhere else.
I feel better now.
I'd like to buy this doll.
This is how I learned English.
I think that Tom will be OK.
Could you tell us what happened next?
I often catch colds.
There's nothing nefarious going on here.
How was your nap?
They can produce the same goods at a far lower cost.
Please stay.
May I use this telephone?
I can't sleep at night.
I'll give you something for the pain.
It's a pity that you can't come.
I have something urgent to attend to.
He's my older brother.
Nobody backed up what I said.
I didn't make the rules.
She took her ring off and threw it at him.
I lost sight of my friends.
He stood by me whenever I was in trouble.
There are beautiful flowers here and there in the garden.
Do it this way.
Do you want kids?
You have no idea how tired I am of all this complaining.
I thought we were friends.
Do you mind if I use your computer?
I'll call you when I get there.
Did you say that Tom is your friend?
Can you prove Tom didn't do it?
Let's meet on Sunday.
Tom is really good.
I made that decision on my own.
Leave our house.
Let's not allow that to happen.
He promoted the idea of world government.
Tom, look at what you did.
If he'd been there, he'd have told you to mind your manners.
I have some doubts about his coming in this weather.
I saw him crossing the road.
Their relationship is deteriorating.
You can't leave me hanging.
Tell me what I did wrong.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
Listen carefully.
If he's fluent in English, I'll hire him.
Tom always likes to joke around.
This didn't cost anything.
You may use my dictionary.
Everybody in the world desires peace.
What was the outcome?
I'm not ready to die.
Did you win the case?
I prefer cats to dogs.
We know how to find Tom.
That's what I wrote.
What kind of insurance do you have?
I think you should do this on your own.
I hope she's safe.
We have a big dog.
Where did you go for spring break?
I gave up eating dessert.
The French team scored as many goals as the English team.
Have you ever been run over?
I thought I heard your voice.
There's nothing I wouldn't do for Tom.
When are we going to do it?
Are you ready now?
Do you want a hand?
No one's judging you.
One of my neighbors called and said I left one of my windows open.
You're temperamental.
I'd like to stay longer.
We were granted the privilege of fishing in this bay.
I'll support him.
Tom's funny.
Does anyone have any questions thus far?
Please do something about it.
She did it again.
We're very grateful.
There's no money.
I almost kissed him.
Tom hasn't broken any rules.
Something's not right.
Her condition grew worse last night.
I don't trust politicians.
I know what it's like to be alone.
The reporter criticized the politician.
She decided to resign her job.
We can't live without water for even one day.
Tom will be an adult soon.
She looks pretty no matter what she wears.
The boys worked hard.
We've painted the walls white.
Have you seen my camera?
You should go to the dentist and have that tooth pulled out.
He is constantly complaining.
I don't want to forget.
Obviously I made a mistake.
I would like chicken soup.
I think it's time for me to discuss the matter with him.
What were you doing before this?
Check it out!
I can't really remember.
I went for a walk to try to sober up.
Why would somebody want to live there?
It was there yesterday.
I want to go skiing with Tom.
She seemed uninterested.
Don't do something stupid.
I'm successful.
She complained of a headache.
They hired someone else for the job.
She tossed me grapes and I tried to catch them with my mouth.
I told you it wasn't over.
I hope you're not alone.
Is that what you think I want to hear?
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
Have you gotten over your cold yet?
I think Tom did something he shouldn't have.
At last, my turn came.
You didn't tell the story very well.
This is your fault.
I suggest that you try to get some sleep.
Tom often changes his mind.
What's worrying you?
It's not as easy as you think.
I like being part of this group.
That's all for now.
The climate is mild in this country.
You lied to the FBI.
Children like playing on the beach.
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
Can I call you back in twenty minutes?
I will come with you.
The people here are accustomed to the cold.
Shall we go and eat?
They were scared to do it.
I tripped.
They say he's sick.
Show me how much money you have.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be the boss.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
We can't go.
I'd like to see you in my office.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
I'm going to my grandmother's.
Don't let the grass grow under your feet.
Everybody knows that he lost his leg in the war.
I suggest you listen carefully.
I asked Tom to help us.
Dogs have a strong sense of smell.
I don't remember his name.
I don't feel like eating anything.
The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv.
Tom is supposed to do that without any help.
I'll be in my office from ten tomorrow.
Take the wheel.
Towns are larger than villages.
I'd like to stand.
They met each other halfway.
I really need to go home and catch some zees.
I couldn't take your place.
Did they hurt you?
I read this book again and again.
Let me get my wallet.
Tom's stoned.
We're all armed.
I don't know why we have to stop.
Many friends came to see me off.
I did you a favor.
I don't recognize the number.
Doing it that way will take a long time.
I made dinner.
I think it's fine.
What's your favorite way to cook beans?
The rumor can't be true.
I like cats very much.
I thought you were older than me.
He denied having written to me.
I want them to be your friends.
You are good.
Generally speaking, Japanese are hard workers.
I stared at the man.
He was wrong.
We'll fight.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Is this your DVD?
We lost.
I admire his talent.
Could you do me a favor?
You're absolutely correct.
I helped my father yesterday.
I shouldn't have to tell you to do your homework.
No Canadians were injured.
Here's your order.
I know Tom is a foreigner.
When ice melts, it becomes water.
She'll get the better of you if you aren't careful.
I must get it fixed.
We need a little rest.
The boy is tall for his age.
She used to enjoy being with him.
He made no reply.
It'll be all right.
I don't think that's possible.
I don't know how to speak French.
Here's the money I owe you.
I told him about our school.
I've come this far, so I'll keep going.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
What does this word mean?
Play outside instead of watching TV.
I want more of that.
Your French is excellent.
I saw the movie on video.
There's still plenty that needs to be done.
What time does it close?
Tom is truly gifted.
No one likes me.
How did you get out of your room?
She fainted, but came to after a few minutes.
Tom fell off the chair.
You're very tall.
The professor is making a phone call.
This is hilarious.
She has never sung a song with him.
She advised him to take the medicine.
You didn't give me what I wanted.
I can't wait any more.
I used a ribbon to tie my hair into a ponytail.
Has anyone ever broken your heart?
He is a good match for me in tennis.
Tom skipped dinner saying he was too tired to eat.
Everyone seeks happiness.
Tom was determined to finish the job before he went home.
That's all you're interested in, isn't it?
The world is more dangerous than I thought.
I will stay at home.
He kissed her goodbye and left, never to be seen again.
Tom has been teaching me how to play the guitar.
You'll be fine.
I can lend you some money if you need some.
Tom forgot.
It cost me one thousand yen to get the bicycle fixed.
I can't bear it.
I hid myself behind the couch.
I would like to drastically decrease the amount of time it takes me to clean the house.
Tom made no comment.
You don't need to come so early.
Half of the students are absent.
I know that Tom is a thug.
You look like you don't want to be here.
He was a brave soldier.
Did it go well today?
We were caught in a snowstorm.
Why are you so insecure?
He knows that you know.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
They're too fat.
Talking to Tom isn't going to help.
Have you been out at all?
Let's go outside and sit in the garden.
I work every day except for Sundays.
Tom promised to take me fishing.
I'm not particularly impressed.
Isn't it your day off?
I baked it for you.
How long were you there?
What exactly is your book about?
How is everyone?
Don't be naive.
I want to stretch my legs.
I'm at your mercy.
I had to change the plan.
I never for a moment imagined that I would still be doing this kind of thing at my age.
They're anxious for peace.
She was very happy with my gift.
This is the very dictionary I've been looking for.
Will Tom be ready?
This no longer matters.
It took more than a month to get over my cold, but I'm OK now.
Show it to her.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
Do you want a few more minutes?
They eat fish on Fridays.
I know he did it.
Try putting yourself in your mother's shoes.
I probably shouldn't have done that.
He never stops to think.
Fold up the map.
I could scarcely stand on my feet.
It's worth a trip.
The book is mine.
There's nothing on TV.
Tom concealed his anger from Mary.
They huddled together.
We have a small table in the kitchen.
Spouses are also welcome.
I am a teacher, too.
It's not uncommon to see Americans kissing in public.
Tom says he's planning on buying a gift for Mary.
Do you have a problem?
That isn't what I was saying at all.
The book is on the table.
They are afraid of death.
Tom and John are cellmates.
Did anyone see you on the beach?
I haven't asked you a question yet.
I couldn't walk.
She showers every morning.
You should do that right now.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
I know that you're smart.
She burst out laughing when she saw me.
You can get rid of the cold if you take this medicine.
You need to be here by 2:30 at the latest.
Are they friends of yours?
I want to know what this is called.
They're speaking French.
Just be glad you're OK.
He has only a superficial knowledge of the subject.
Where are your things?
Which one will they choose?
We've done all that we could.
I heard the news on the radio.
I want to buy a dozen eggs.
You may take anything you like.
She told him that she had seen me there last week.
How much do those things cost?
I'd like to sleep late tomorrow.
We've got plenty of time.
My sister isn't studying now.
Where did you spend your holidays?
I can survive this.
I needed to be sure he'd come here.
We can't just act as if nothing has happened.
Tom had many friends.
The doors opened.
She told me that she would go to Paris in August.
He made up his mind quickly.
He turned up 30 minutes late.
I don't care why you're late.
I'm not hungry anyway.
She has a small black dog.
Can you persuade him to join our club?
This is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
Is it nice?
We all agree with you.
They finished their meal.
I promise to do my best.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
He asked me what I had bought.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
A trust fund has been set up for each of the children.
How did you celebrate your birthday?
They don't trust you.
Quit acting like a baby.
Tom wouldn't have done that.
People can choose to start loving, but can't choose to stop.
But you're not there.
I can't bear the pain anymore.
He has brown eyes.
What country were you born in?
Should I take the bus?
I thought you'd want it back.
I like the Terminator films because the special effects are fantastic.
I hope you all understand.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
If I were caught, do you know what would happen?
Do you remember anything else?
She is hard up for money.
He made me do it.
Are there any French magazines in your school library?
We were just playing.
Tom is a French teacher.
Don't screw it up!
He likes oranges.
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
Why not just knock on the door?
Nobody answered the phone.
He left Japan for Europe.
Would you be willing to help?
My father will support me financially.
The Japanese government can't cope with the problem.
He still has not written the letter.
That's the last straw!
Did you hear that?
What am I to do next?
There has to be a first time for everything.
Tom washed the car this morning.
How long will that be?
Do you want that warmed up?
Tom knows the city quite well.
He was born in this very room.
He will be playing tennis tomorrow afternoon.
Prices are double what they were ten years ago.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
Never choose a vocation just because it promises social standing.
He seems absorbed in his work.
This artist's lifestyle is unconventional.
It's a cliche, but it's true.
How much is the commission?
Few people came to the lecture.
I'm buying fruit and chocolate.
It depends on how much money you have.
The door creaked.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
I'm fed up with English.
She couldn't convince him to write a song for her.
She cleaned her room in a hurry.
I'm not your servant.
Did you like it?
Can you watch my dog while I’m away?
It won't be necessary for us to come back here tomorrow.
He has made up his mind to buy the car.
Am I allowed to use this?
I'm lying on the grass.
Why are the windows open?
I'm friends with a lot of cops.
Tom said it was on his desk.
I don't like to go out after dark.
I didn't really want to do that.
You're crafty.
Where's the closest bus stop?
I also went there.
My bicycle has a flat.
I like oysters.
She has not finished her homework yet.
Tom told me that Mary would be ready to do that.
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?
Who's the captain of this ship?
She was absent because she caught a cold.
He didn't come to school yesterday.
I had the porter carry my suitcase.
I'll send you home in my car.
I'm not pretty.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Mary is respected by everyone.
I'm just glad no one was killed.
I didn't realize you were already here.
Do you like football?
You're always saying that.
What are your duties?
Whenever I go to a Japanese restaurant, I take the disposable chopsticks home with me.
The unexpected always happens.
Tom, your life's in danger.
There is a bus stop near our school.
Don't talk during class.
Cook for me.
Are you sure you saw someone on the bridge?
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.
You're dirty.
Tom asked Mary to wake him up at six.
This book isn't worth reading.
That blue dress suits you very well.
I would sooner die than get up early every morning.
I don't know anything about it at all.
He drinks a glass of water every morning.
For all his wealth, he is unhappy.
We're interested in observing the customs of different regions.
Do you guys need a lift?
I love what I'm doing right now.
This tastes a lot better than what I usually eat.
For dinner, we went back to my place.
Do you have this symptom often?
You probably don't remember me.
He had an operation on his left leg.
Cover for me.
She is playing with a doll.
When I arrived at the station, the train had already left.
I think we lost Tom.
Tom says he'll pay back all the money he owes me before Monday.
He fills the bill.
I will have him repair this watch.
He explained in detail what he had seen.
He kept it secret.
This should be fun.
I slept very well last night.
She asked us to dinner.
The air we breathe consists of oxygen and nitrogen.
I think that you're mistaken.
I'll be there on Saturday.
You don't mind if I leave early, do you?
How can I make him stop?
I am very tall.
He believed in the truth.
The door is open. I'll go and shut it.
How do you milk a cow?
He left a minute ago.
He cut the apple in half.
I first met Tom when I was a little kid.
He hung an old, wooden oar on his wall as a decoration.
People don't smoke here.
Return to your room.
They'll let us know.
I tried to open the door, but I couldn't since it was locked.
I've got some stuff to do here.
Is everybody all right?
Why are you helping me?
Let's treat everybody fairly.
Do you have a problem?
I should go to bed.
The food is spoiled.
Bring your sister next time.
Concentrate, Tom.
You already know who I'm talking about, don't you?
My grandmother lives by herself.
I just want to make it home in one piece.
She told us not to make a noise.
Handling dynamite can be dangerous.
Don't you find it interesting?
My mother told me I needed to eat less candy.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
Help me, please.
I'll get fired if I don't do it.
We're crazy about each other.
He's a notorious liar.
Tell me. I'm all ears.
What will you have?
He's looking at you.
It's not that cold.
Don't you talk back to me.
Tom took credit for my idea.
I don't even like you.
Why did they hire you?
I hate to see children cry.
He stood up for what was right.
You have changed a lot.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench.
I'm glad that I still live here.
I think we can come up with better plan than this.
A few minutes' walk brought me to the shore.
I can't drive a bus.
Where did you get your camera repaired?
I have to try.
He became a famous actor.
I know that I'm right.
I don't know where I was born.
His name sounds familiar.
I asked Tom if I could use his computer.
I should've been a little more patient.
Choose one.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
Let me see that list.
He's skilled at videogames.
It never rains but it pours.
When did you seed the lawn?
I had a lot of fun.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
I just need to blow off some steam.
Stay home so that you can answer the phone.
If Tom didn't write this, then who did?
Does this ring a bell?
Can you see Tom?
I didn't know she was married.
You don't really want that, do you?
I'm not sure how to answer this.
It's a vague story.
It would have been nice if Tom had listened to what I said more carefully.
They released the prisoner.
It must've slipped my mind.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
It won't take me much time to do that.
I appreciate the support.
Would you want to live like that?
I'm still not satisfied.
Tom lost his house keys.
They were soldiers.
I love winter.
Stay right where you are.
You never asked what I wanted.
They visited us.
Do you mind if I tag along?
I'm going to put a stop to it.
Tom is our oldest child and Mary is the youngest.
You really do have a beautiful voice.
Have you really already found a new job?
God sent a sign.
Start reading where you left off.
Why didn't you run away?
He did the right thing.
Her belief in God is very firm.
We're normal.
Do you know my name?
Do you understand everything?
Your secret's safe with us.
He managed to escape.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
Mary is a formidable woman.
I've been a ski instructor for three years.
You made a wise choice.
Who takes care of you?
I fell down the stairs.
You need to lower your standards.
I thought you were taller.
I'm right outside.
Stop reading comic books while working.
Hit the lights and let's go.
Both Tom and Mary work full time.
I don't know how to make stew.
I'll come back.
The teacher caught the student cheating on the examination.
She was on the verge of killing herself.
Don't you want to know who that man is?
Your parents must be so proud of you.
Tom was the only one who laughed.
Tom certainly hadn't done anything that deserved that kind of punishment.
I called the cops.
You said you wanted the truth.
In those days, few people could travel abroad.
People who don't want to go, don't have to.
I rang the bell.
In autumn, leaves change color and fall.
Come on, let's try it.
They'll like that.
Is she gone?
She deliberately exposed him to danger.
Take a look.
I did warn you.
I left my glasses at home.
He ate twice as much as I did.
I often think of my dead mother.
It's so different.
I'm sure I saw something moving.
I was falsely accused.
There was no explosion.
I wish it were tomorrow already.
This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it.
I need them.
What did you take a picture of?
Leave the book where it was.

I can't do without your advice.
Tom pounded on the door.
Tom likes ponies.
He drove the truck to Dallas.
Can you use a computer?
A bear can climb a tree.
I can teach you how to cook.
I love your garden.
That's enough for me.
This is the latest fashion.
Are you listening to me?
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
Tom has too many strange ideas.
I want to keep working here.
She held him by the sleeve.
Let's clear up this problem.
As F. Scott Fitzgerald famously noted, the rich are different from you and me.
We saw Tom on the beach.
I was given this ticket.
I can't do this by myself.
His new movie is disappointing.
Tom became an engineer.
Tom says he has an announcement to make.
We chopped our way through the jungle.
Who built this place?
Could you please give me some more examples of that?
I was given a medal.
He was so confused that his answer did not make any sense.
Where did you find it, at school or at home?
I think you did great.
Does anyone want a beer?
He took part in the race.
He's been staying at that hotel since five days ago.
I am off today.
American generals believed they could win an easy victory.
People learn from experience.
Tom fastened his seat belt.
I prepared breakfast for Tom.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
This would embarrass anyone.
They already know.
Everything is new.
Let me explain.
We have three of them.
My life is in your hands.
He's right behind you.
We want to buy a house in Boston.
I knew all along that he was telling a lie.
I thought it would be fun.
She owns a Turner.
What do you mean?
I really wish I could be there with you.
I'd love to be a fly on the wall at the meeting of the senior executives about the future of the company.
I led that mission.
He came downstairs.
Hide the money.
My T-shirt shrank because I washed it.
It did not come off.
We all deserve respect.
Tom certainly gives the impression that he doesn't know what he's doing.
How much do you charge to fix a flat tire?
This road leads to the river.
How many hours are left?
May I keep this photograph?
The swimmer raised his head and gasped for breath.
Do you have something else in mind?
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast.
Is there something you'd like to do?
Drink less and sleep more.
A mist hung over the river.
What have you done with the books?
I bought a new sewing machine.
What time are you coming?
Tom is there.
Life has just begun.
Can I get a beer?
Your criticism is unfair.
I've been saying that all along.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
We should ask Tom.
I'm going to the country with my friends.
Our mother had no choice but to make dinner with leftovers.
I ate lunch in a hurry.
Tom is waiting at the bus stop.
This lake is deepest at this point.
What's your excuse?
That's not true and you know it.
She asked him to help her father clean the garage, but he said that he was too busy to help.
I don't see your name on it.
We must obey the law.
His parents go to church every Sunday.
What do you mean, you can't help me?
I didn't like what he said at all.
I feel flattered.
Don't talk about me.
I call on him every other day.
Crime is down.
Her name wasn't on the list.
I need to borrow some money.
Do you need the key?
You can't keep this a secret.
What keeps you awake at night?
It's fun to play tennis.
I don't know what I was expecting.
You don't look that good.
Add a bit of sugar, please.
Will you sell your house to him?
You're spending too much time on the computer.
We're both insane.
You need to come home.
I've got blisters on my feet.
The cat doesn't look happy to see us.
I'll play along.
Help me print this.

You write well.
You must not forget your schoolbooks.
Who sent you here?
As long as you keep quiet, you can stay here.
Whose bicycle is that?
You should always tell the truth.
She decided not to go.
The message was fake.
I lost my way in New York.
This is a great business opportunity.
Can you imagine walking on the moon?
She showed her courage in the face of danger.
Let me put off my decision.
How's your wife, Tom?
Biodiversity continues to decline each year.
He is playing golf.
Even God cannot make two times two not make four.
He's my partner.
What we're doing is dangerous.
What do you see in him?
I am not happy with my job.
I can't think of his name.
She will be here before long.
Tom told me he didn't get enough sleep.
Tom doesn't earn enough money to support a family.
The problem isn't that.
You're too slow.
They forced him to tell the truth.
You never get my jokes.
Let's continue the game after lunch.
You're very flexible.
I motivated you.
I want to figure this out.
Would you mind if I poured myself a cup of coffee?
Did you hear my son play the violin?
I tried to help him.
It's now your turn.
I'm not frightened of anything.
I'm coming over to your place.
I never see her without thinking of her mother.
She told him that she didn't love him.
How much longer do we have to stay here?
You must tell me.
It's terrifying.
They saw him enter the room.
I will look after your cat while you are away.
All of us plan to do that.
You can see it with the naked eye.
I don't like this one.
I think you should think about the future.
I will wait outside.
Buy the dress you want.
Both Tom and Mary were absent today.
We went to the zoo.
He feels a lot better today.
There was a discussion on the measures.
Tom got these tickets for free.
They are very big.
This is where my father works.
I hate everyone, and everyone hates me.
We can't be the only two people who're late.
I didn't see you.
Thank you for helping me write my resume.
Was this your idea?
Are you sure?
That vending machine is out of order.
Tom knows a shortcut.
Shots were fired.
I'm on my way to work.
I wonder if there's a market for something like that.
They made the goal.
I don't remember anything about that.
I like vanilla ice cream very much.
She is qualified as a nurse.
Tom doesn't remember what happened.
She has a daughter named Mary.
Thank you for the pleasant evening.
All right, listen carefully.
We'll try to be more careful the next time.
It makes no difference whether you go or not.
May I make a suggestion?
Nobody is too old to learn.
I wonder who this is from.
Don't play with fire.
I don't want to see you.
May I borrow your lawnmower?
Wash your hands.
Luckily, the weather turned out fine.
Make it smaller.
The murderer was executed.
I don't understand why this isn't working.
Tom has three guitars.
We aren't related.
He has his own car.
I don't feel like watching TV.
We couldn't agree on anything.
Tom realized that what Mary said wasn't true.
Cats have pointed ears.
Tom probably thought I was thirsty.
I spent the entire morning in bed.
I like this.
How do you prove that?
Come on, sing with me.
She cooked a special dinner for him.
Who's been eating my peanuts?
The results were conclusive.
You haven't eaten, have you?
This just isn't like you.
Make another choice.
Can they see us?
What's going to happen?
This is a difficult mission.
We're tired.
Are you sure you're up for it?
I want you to dance with me.
What does this look like to you?
You must continue to train.
Tom is a banjo player, too.
I know you must have a lot of questions.
You're a snob.
She advised him to stop taking that medicine.
I guess I should get home to the missus.
I'm out of shape.
These politicians are corrupt.
I need you here.
He wanted it to be a surprise.
He paid 1,000 yen for this book.
I'm beginning to get curious.
I was just mugged.
You seem like a very smart person.
I have it.
What was he doing here?
The customs office is at the border.
Who's the richest person in Australia?
I couldn't make myself heard in the classroom.
We're on the same team, right?
Are you responsible for this?
The plane flew above the clouds.
The problem is we don't have much time.
That should suffice.
Tom noticed several differences.
Try to learn a little English.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
He hates running.
Foxes have few natural predators.
The plan was discussed in detail.
I like tea.
You won't be fired.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
I don't think what we did helped.
Your mother will repeat it to you as many times as necessary.
We're all hungry.
I didn't eat dinner last night.
I know that I'm supposed to enjoy this class, but I don't.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Speak slowly and clearly.
How many times have you moved?
Act like a man.
I looked around and noticed that mine was the only car on the road.
Do you think I'm healthy?
I've put your birthday on my calendar.
My life was in danger.
Are you still up?
Did you see Tom that night?
The new computer is ten times as fast as the old one.
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
What would your mother think?
Tom's death was preventable.
Do you want to stay here all night?
I was scared stiff.
The papers got blown away.
Tom wants to say yes, but he can't.
I want something to drink now.
No matter how sneaky you are, you can never surprise yourself.
Buses are running at 20 minute intervals.
We're ready for this.

We love coffee.
We can still win this game.
Where shall we have breakfast today?
He knows how to fly a helicopter.
A big earthquake occurred in India yesterday.
Why are you being so negative?
She made the same mistake as before.
I need your help to find Tom.
Daily exercise is essential for your health.
I was pleasantly surprised.
I figured I might find you here.
I nearly blacked out.
Isn't that what you said?
I slept aboard the ship.
I couldn't eat another bite.
Let me paint you a picture.
They painted the window frames yellow.
I have to remember to mail the letter.
You never told me you were married.
The concert hasn't yet begun.
I'll be happy to help you.
Are you a golfer?
He's thrilled with his new job.
He can't read it.
He's aware of his own faults.
We're still waiting for Tom.
Are you as tall as me?
Many people are upset.
I just feel like relaxing.
I have no insurance.
We bought a round table.
I wasn't busy today.
I wanted to meet you.
Where is the library?
There is little money left.
I've never stopped loving you.
Don't throw stones.
She was the first one to help him.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I spent the summer vacation at my aunt's house.
We ate an early lunch while we were at the mall.
People around the world are getting fatter.
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Tom doesn't want Mary to get involved.
What time did you get up today?
Please don't speak so fast.
My shoelace got caught in the escalator.
I know a good lawyer who can help you.
It is truly a nice day today.
We never should've done that.
Facebook is boring.
When did I tell you that?
I've heard that song before.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
We have to do better.
If I had not overslept, I would have been in time for school.
You've got your permit, right?
We've got a boat.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
I don't see any way of doing that.
Are you upset?
Hi. How are you doing?
He doesn't have a hat on.
I told you not to talk about the matter in her presence.
He needed the money.
Don't forget the milk.
He asked me if I were happy.
Tom was shot.
Why are you surprised?
Tom doesn't know whether to turn left or right.
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
I missed you kids.
Tom is starved.
It was mad of him to try to swim in the icy water.
His neighbors are suspicious of him.
I can't accept this.
The cause of the accident is a complete mystery.
I know it's not easy.
I don't know what you're so worried about.
I inquired about the book in many stores.
I don't have a dog.
How could he possibly think that would work?
Tom didn't let Mary do that.
Tom is on his way back to Boston.
You can't just walk in here and start dictating policy.
Since he doesn't feel well today, he can't come to the office.
Is she so stupid that she believes such a thing?
I've never trusted you and I never will.
May I ask a couple of questions?
We'll wait here.
Did you solve the problem?
That is a reputable store.
He acted without thinking.
This is too good a chance to miss.
How does he know that?
Did he stay very long?
There is a little hope that he will succeed.
I didn't know how to do it, but I was willing to give it a try.
I noticed him sitting with his back against the wall.
We haven't found it.
Down with the king!
Tom killed Mary because he found out she had started the fire that had killed his family.
Did you understand me?
I don't know if I'll have time to do it.
We don't need you.
I'm sure of his success.
Did you enjoy the movie you saw last night?
Have you finished reading the novel?
She peeked through the curtain.
He will come back in a few days.
I thought you'd wear something like that.
Have you ever seen a koala?
Cherry trees are planted along the street.

The food is on the table.
I'm younger than I look.
He studied hard.
What's Tom's office number?
I taught myself French.
I see a book.
I won't be back for a while.
It's OK with me.
My uncle has been diagnosed with leukemia.
This has got to stop.
My dad thinks my boyfriend is a real whack job.
He was stunned.
Why didn't you tell this to the police?
Not knowing what to say, I kept silent.
In conversation, one is likely to find out certain things about the other person quite easily.
Who's protecting Tom?
Reading books is very interesting.
I'd like to make a speech.
I don't want to offend you.
The homework is due next week.
I want to kill you right now.
I don't understand music.
He became ever more famous as a critic.
I have been expecting you.
Do you remember what to do?
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
I had to lie again.
What do you want then?
If you run into trouble, I'll help, and so will my father.
Let go of the bottle.
You don't seem very sure.
He hit two birds with one stone.
You have problems.
I have a surprise for you guys.
I'd like to see your sister.
I prefer it that way.
Not everybody can be a poet.
I want to see your house.
Can you give me a better explanation?
Thank you for all you've done for us.
The doctor thinks Tom's problem is psychological.
I can't do without your advice.
I'm looking for my cellphone.
No one is listening to me.
We could live in peace here.
My house isn't very large, but it's large enough for me.
I'll send you a postcard from Boston.
Can I try it?
How do you intend to do that?
I don't know how I've offended you.
We worked on it all night.
I want you to get off my back.
Aren't you tired?
Tom doesn't understand Mary's reluctance to go out with his brother.
I shouldn't have to tell you to keep your room clean.
The company's share price has fallen.
I think we should all go inside.
I'd like to make a toast.
You're a very good football player.
How much longer are we going to wait?
I can't believe he kissed you.
No matter how rich he may be, he is never contented.
I'll stay there till six o'clock.
I know Tom isn't ready yet.
Did you recognize any of those people?
Tom is hoping you'll do it.
You're a very gifted artist.
Tom made a promise to himself that he would never make the same mistake again.
He likes reading books.
This is simply not true.
Tom is moving to Boston.
We're totally cool with that.
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
How much more work do you have?
That's his.
Act your age.
You said that half an hour ago.
They can't see me.
I can't believe it's really you.
Don't you remember what you said?
It's my left eye that's bothering me.
Is something wrong with the helicopter?
She got up to answer the phone.
Don't be rude.
The TV doesn't work.
I need to talk to Tom right now.
Women are better at this than men.
We were taught that Newton discovered the law of gravity.
I wonder where Tom put the key.
Do you want me to shuffle the cards?
Like all dogs, he'll chase a rabbit if he sees one.
What game do you want to play now?
It was personal.
There is a library in every city in America.
I'm playing with my friends.
Can you save Tom?
She brought me a cup of tea.
She applied her mind to her new job.
I'm not happy.
If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold.
I'll make some calls.
Come over to our table.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
This bad weather is more than I bargained for.
Tom hasn't had a fight with anybody lately.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
She waited patiently for him.
That's exactly what I think.
Sometimes I say "yes," even though I want to say "no."
I have no kids.
I want to know what this is all about.
That's the problem with doing things your way.
The Mayor addressed a large audience.
Tom said he thought that pair of shoes were too expensive.
I love being alone.
We're angry.
I was naive.
Are you expecting anyone?
I'll help Tom do that tomorrow.
What's Tom like?
I will definitely attend your funeral.
You are the most important person in my life.
That's only part of the truth.
They were dancing to the music.

We really hope another war will not break out.
The clown fell down on purpose.
My mother gets up the earliest every morning.
I won't put up with this any longer.

Maybe it's not that bad.
I'm feeling much better.

Did I really do that?

I'm not entirely sure.

What exactly do you plan to do?
My nose is running.
Juggling is actually a lot easier than it looks.
Aren't you annoyed by that?
We need to protect ourselves.
Tom is just a little bit shorter than Mary is.

We had snow this morning.
Tom told me that he would leave soon.
It won't cost you a dime.

Use this as a model.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
I don't often think about the past.
You're extroverted.
I like walking to school.
Please give me a call.
I can't be sure.
What can you tell me about that?

Everyone is happy.
You don't know what this is, do you?
He raised his hands.
Is that what you think I want to hear?
I think Tom is loyal.
I have to go back to the office.
Please take some of them.

That film is for children.
That textbook is out of date.
He wanted to buy the book.

You've got the wrong person.
I have no hesitation in telling the truth.
You were great today.
What are you playing with?
She has about 2,000 books.
I'll fix you a cup of tea.

Aren't you going to Tom's party?
Let's take a trip to New York.
I hope to continue to see more of the world.
He was delighted to know I had passed the exam.
I haven't seen you around before.
Giving up isn't the answer.
I can't really remember.
It's a bit further way.
I find you attractive.
I'm not going to do anything you don't want me to.
You were so awesome.
Most Americans do not object to my calling them by their first names.

Never argue with a drunk.
Don't be ashamed of who you are.
Did you have fun last night?
There's nothing up here.
That would be fantastic.

I have three sisters.
It's a question of life or death.
We'll get started as soon as we can.
I can't figure this out.
I really like garlic.
I dreamed that I was buying this guitar.
The pain was more than he could stand.
Are you all doing well?
What a waste of money!
Could you turn it down?
That's not all that happened.
Nothing can change that.
It's hard to do.
Can I rely on you?
I want you to handle this.
I'll be happy to work with you.
She went to Mexico by herself.
You should go to the dentist and have that tooth pulled out.
We have no reason to change our plans.
You're always singing.
You need to stay awake.
What do you think happened to Tom?
I ordered way too much. I don't think I can eat it all.
It is not so difficult as you think.
Will it be much longer?
I'm sorry for what I did.
That guy annoys me.
We had a heated discussion.
Does anyone know you're here?
I don't want to step on your toes.
I've tried everything.
The town is always crawling with tourists.
Don't you have an interesting face?
He pushed me gently.
We intended to start right away.
I let you catch me.
I was misinformed.
What did you do?
I want to sleep for a while.
It was unlocked.
Can I use your telephone?
Every boy and girl is taught to read and write.
Go with your instinct.
Tom came to ask us for our help.
I'm calling security.
I was upstairs.
It's personal.
I want to change my shirt.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to drive.

Tom promised to clean the living room.
Tom had to swallow his pride and admit that he needed help.
We're very close.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
Keep in touch with me.
Enjoy your weekend.
That's not exactly a top priority.
This is a common error.
We just want you to tell the truth.
They accused me of being a liar.
He's away on vacation.
Are you sleeping in here?
She thinks about him all the time.
My boss was very strict.
Don't try to do too much.
My father was about to leave when the telephone rang.
We haven't yet succeeded.
Tom doesn't drink milk.
We just landed.
I think you know everyone here.
There were too many of them.
Why are you so hungry?
His car spun out of control going around the curve.
That must be a misprint.
Let's welcome our guests.
Their ship struck a rock.
You understand me very well.
I can't reach the top shelf.
I will tell her what to say at the meeting.
I live too far away.
He was not able to join in the discussion.
She has never been in love.
Nobody can help you.
I just want to be alone.
He skipped a grade.
You're going to die.
Please write to me from time to time.
Both of us want to see the movie.
Tom left everything to me.
You're very resourceful.
I have to eat, too.
I want to see your boss.
I think I understand what Tom's trying to say.
I have to talk to you alone.
He's so young.
It will only take a moment to answer the question.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
I forget your phone number.
I like your techno dance moves.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
The beds are uncomfortable.
Tom found a hundred dollar bill on the street.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
Why don't you stay and drink some wine with us?
I don't like any of them.
I think Tom will tell you.
Were you sincere?
Do you talk to your cats?
He balanced himself on a log.
I hope it'll be fine tomorrow.
Would you lend me some money?
I don't like who you've become.
I never could hide anything from you.
Tell Tom that I'm not home.
Tom is the person who helped Mary.
Indeed you know a lot of things, but you're not good at teaching them.
I went to see his sister last week.
The dog went away.
It was just a stupid mistake.
They're all liars.
Tom didn't come to the last meeting.
People who go to bed early and get up early live a long time.
He won't be in time for the meeting.
What a hypocrite!
I'm getting kind of hungry. Let's go get something to eat.
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
She didn't know what to say to him.
You know I have no choice, don't you?
I didn't spend anything.
They've changed a lot.

What were her final words?
She knows many proverbs.
He's just trying to be popular.
The Americans had very little gunpowder.
We see what we expect to see.
I know that Japanese songs are very difficult for us.
I'm sleepy because I stayed up all night studying for a test.
Did you ask the price?
I turned right.
We found a secret passage into the building.
There's a fire in the building. We have to evacuate immediately.
I think you deserve more than this.
You look so beautiful.
You don't seem very pleased.
You don't look that good.
Who is younger, him or me?
I don't have time for that.
You're lucky you didn't die.
I'm visiting my grandmother in the hospital.
Tom can't take his eyes off Mary.
I will be glad to help you anytime.
I listen to the radio after dinner.
Two vanilla ice creams please.
I value our friendship more than anything.
Come quick!
We agreed on a price.
We're imagining things.
I want to make you an offer.
Have you read this book already?
She blushed.
No wild tigers are to be found in Africa.
She was asked to convince him to get his son to paint the house.
It's your choice.
Tom doesn't like the color of the walls in his bedroom.
My mother gets up earlier than I do.
She decided not to go.
She acted in the play.
I thought they were unemployed.
I speak Chinese almost every day.
You can't hurt my feelings.
She was on the verge of tears.
I think what Tom did was very brave.
You won't be shot.
He was robbed when coming home late at night.
Charles Moore created Forth in an attempt to increase programmer productivity without sacrificing machine efficiency.

At first, I didn't believe you.
Tom's body will be cremated.
Can I go now?
The world is full of unsolved problems.
Is this your favorite song?
We are leaving Japan next month.
If you'd listen, you'd understand.
Could I change rooms?
I love apples.
What're you doing in this park?
The restaurant was quiet.
Have you seen their new apartment?
You are too young to travel alone.
Some people think eating at home is better for you than eating out.
We accept all major credit cards.
Tom showed me his passport.
Tom didn't have enough money to go home by bus.
Don't risk insulting your boss.
Tom goes to church.
Hot lemon with honey is a good remedy for colds.
You must keep the promises you make.
We will fix this.
At what point do we start to worry?
I saw a flock of sheep.
I have drunk all my milk.
Play it cool.
She advised him to go to the police station.
I'm very upset.
Everybody wants to protect you.
I have no comment.
What does an airship look like?
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
My father stretched after dinner.
Both of us began to smile almost at the same time.
I have a big dog.
I need money.
I'm a married man now.
He was intrigued.
Please wait for five minutes.
Why do you want to go to Boston?
I'd love to go fishing with you.
With her heart pounding, she opened the door.
They arrived too soon.
I love what you've done with the place.
None of us plan to go swimming today.
Is it OK if I open a can?
Did they talk to each other?
You've arrived too early.
I can't show you.
I have to remember to mail the letter.
What you're doing is unforgivable.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
We were there for a long time.
I want you back.
Tom has my book.
I'd rather be here than in Boston.
I love you more than anything.
I can't take chances.
Who will you give the book to?
He married a pretty girl.
You cannot take back what you have said.
I am doing my homework.
This is how I did it.
I'm delighted to meet you.
That perfume smells good.
Did you say yes?
Let me remind you of something.
Have you seen Tom recently?
He is used to talking to foreigners.
If you abuse your computer, it won't work well.
Why are you torturing me?
Tom is dating a Chinese exchange student.
What's for dessert?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
We know you're interested.
I'm doing well.
Nothing scares me.
I reminded him to write to his mother soon.
This is not enough.
I can't believe you're taking pictures of cockroaches.
Pull over here.
The sales of this model took off.
Don't go in that building.
We're not dead yet.
Tom has blisters on his feet.
I really appreciate you meeting with me.
She was a great help to me.
OK, I'll give it a try.
I couldn't look at it any longer.
Do you know Tom's girlfriend's name?
You'll get another chance.
Tom doesn't owe anybody anything.
This is a picture of you.
Every movement is painful.
I'd like to go home.
I've been there before.
He is a friendly person.
Haven't you learned your lesson?
A burnt child dreads the fire.
I'm often only half awake.
You look terrible.
The weather remained rainy.
I couldn't stop laughing.
I wish I knew what happened to all our family photos.
You need to be prepared.
What do you think happens then?
I have to change tires.
She's very pretty.
I'm not so sure anymore.
We have enough water.
This will protect your skin.
She came close to drowning.
We've got a suspect in custody.
I don't know where she lives.
It was just a matter of time.
He was destined never to meet her again.
We're not cowards.
I'm doing you a favor.
He was excommunicated.
You know what you have to do.
Do you think it'll fit?
You don't have to trouble yourselves.
Your composition is the best yet.
The Amazon is fed by a large number of tributaries.
Athletes are no different.
I don't need to write it down.
This storm will also pass.
I'm full.
Do you want to see something gross?
We have to escape.
I was alone in the classroom.
His careless driving caused the accident.
The baby was naked.
It turned out to be true.
That's what they all say.
Everybody looked nervous.
The boy has never been to the zoo.
Tom probably thought I was thirsty.
I really like my coworkers.
You did that the wrong way.
These are mine.
I haven't got rid of my bad cold yet.
Don't make me do it again.
You're all happy.
That's not an issue anymore.
I got my son to repair the door.
I wish I had more time to spend with friends.
My mother is busy preparing supper.
Heaven knows we've done everything we can.
Where's the boss?
Have you ever taken a lie detector test?
I think that that book is not so interesting.
Business is improving.
I'm not sure about it.
I hope Tom has fun.
You look fat.
Some boats are on the lake.
Tom and Mary discovered something amazing.
Does anybody know how the fire started?
I forgot something in my car.
I'm glad you asked me for advice.
We weren't all that busy.
I'd be honored.
Her complaints never cease.
I have better things to do.
You just made a big mistake.
I love playing chess.
I don't have any friends to talk to.
I wonder if that was the point.
Herold agreed to surrender.
We can't afford that.
I have to take the test again.
You might get hurt.
You're a month behind in your rent.
I don't know how Tom found out.
How do I eat this?
I didn't tell him everything.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
He kept me waiting.
Don't make the same mistake again.
I built my son a new house.
I feel a little awkward.
It's pitch black outside.
I finally have everything I need.
There is no end in sight to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
The doctors did what they could.
Are you saying I'm impolite?
I'm being patient.
It's past your bedtime.
You did a very good job.
I had a strange dream last night.
Cut the cake with a knife.
You have to go alone.
What's the idea?
I don't feel so smart.
They made sure nobody could see them.
You're always criticizing me!
I've got a plastic cup.
What if Tom doesn't like me?
You're lucky to have such a good job.
How are you feeling tonight?
Where exactly are you?
I've had the time of my life.
I've had enough of your lying.
I love you just the way you are.
You're the oldest.
This is a story about love and friendship.
Luck is against me.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
I mean no harm.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
What's your nickname?
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you sooner.
Tom was sarcastic.
It rained five successive days.
I can't believe you're here.
I've gotten used to living alone.
Don't you think it's time you left?
It's mine.
He's out of practice.
Why don't you talk to me now?
This hotel is better than the other one.
Let me in.
Does it work?
It's now or never.
Bring me a drink.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
A combination of several mistakes led to the accident.
He can be proud of his father.
There's no point doing that.
He continued the experiment.
Tom kept reading.
Sunday follows Saturday.
We were passengers.
What time is your first class?
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
He traveled with only a dog for company.
I don't go out on weeknights.
I used to do that as a kid.
No one wanted to talk about it.
She got married at the age of 17.
We don't regret that decision.
Instead of taking notes, I spent the whole class doodling.
I will go when they come back here.
We have medicine for you.
I took a taxi from the train station to the hotel.
They arrested her.
She is really a nice girl.
The man who lives next door to me is a doctor.
You'll have to learn all these dates by rote.
What do you want to drink?
Be nice to others.
I told Tom to wait in the car.
Tom had no other choice but to help Mary clean out the garage.
Tom can't ski.
This road goes to the park.
Don't let that worry you.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Stop them.
Life seems so unfair.
Why would you ask that?
Tom seems so nice.
He said something to my friend.
Tom stopped it.
Something was wrong.
Stop being so naive.
He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him.
He was a real drunkard.
I'm just a plain old office worker.
He talks as if he knows everything.
Why don't we take the stairs?
Everyone does what he wants.
I've always thought you knew how to swim.
Tom reminded Mary not to be late.
I've managed to stop the bleeding.
You look very pale.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
Both of us knew that would happen.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
I need to keep moving.
She is attractive.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
He didn't want to leave.
Don't approach the dog.
Novels aren't being read as much as they used to be.
What are we having for dinner tonight?
What's your native language?
He left his son a fortune.
He tricked me.
I went to the hospital to see my uncle.
It was the only thing to do.
What are some foods you usually eat with red wine?
It's a little scary.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Tom owns a lot of cars.
He lay on his back.
I expected a better explanation.
Isn't this wonderful?
I don't know them.
I've taken care of it.
I thought you understood.
Did I hurt you?
Would you like to go have a drink?
Please say it more loudly.
I'll start with a beer.
I'm ready to face any challenge.
I want to know all about you.
Madison made an emotional speech in Congress.
I don't trust anybody.
I appreciate this opportunity.
Let no one escape.
Is it very far from here?
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
They are going to give a party the day after tomorrow.
Who's your most interesting friend?
He's intimidated by beautiful women.
I think we should ask Tom where he wants to live.
The baby is crawling.
My brother won't be at home tomorrow.
A lot of people hate you already.
This was a long letter.
Thank you in advance.
She still buys milk.
I went to sleep as soon as I got home.
We are good friends.
Tom is playing bass guitar.
America is very big.
We went to Boston by bus.
They were victorious.
Tom rinsed off the plates and put them into the dishwasher.
It's going to be difficult for us to do that.
I'm over eighteen.
I no longer study French.
Let's see what happens.
The poor girl went blind.
I made a list of things I needed to do.
I can teach you how to cook.
I tried to make the best of it.
I did nothing of the sort.
It may break.
It's my fault, not yours.
Why didn't you call me last night?
We don't have much more time.
I don't know how to make you happy.
You can't win every time.
It's on my desk.
Did you see the eclipse yesterday?
I don't know how to handle this.
He rested his hand on my shoulder.
Tom returned to his office.
That's bad news.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
Tom doesn't understand because he wasn't paying attention.
You're out of booze.
Would you like me to explain it?
He didn't get the joke.
I never said this job would be easy.
The time bomb exploded with a loud noise.
She has traveled in foreign countries.
No one cares about that anymore.
I could see that.
The house is clean.
How could anyone be so stupid?
I am taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.
Does the end justify the means?
You were perfect.
I will say something about it.
All our students study French.
I appreciate what he did for me.
I'd like to speak with Tom in private.
They walked down the street singing a song.
It was a warm summer night.
I don't yet know what I'm going to do.
Does this medicine work quickly?
There are fifteen people here, counting the guests.
Tom wrung out the towel.
I have the same number of books as Tom has.
We don't want that, do we?
Please make yourself at home here.
Have you decoded the message yet?
If I had had a little more money, I would have bought it.
In case of an emergency, call the police.
We're retiring.
Why don't you drop her a line?
How are you connected?
The trouble is that I have no money with me.
My sister is bugging me.
He used all his strength to crawl out of the wrecked car.
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
That's a bad spot.
You're quite attractive.
She suggested that I should clean the bathroom.
Tom usually wears white tennis shoes.
I thought you'd want to know.
You will miss Japanese food in the United States.
He wrote a letter yesterday.
How old is the oldest person you know?
You must show respect to your guests.
Tom can't say for sure how many times Mary has been to Boston.
Have another drink.
Go away.
I don't have the money to do that.
I'm sorry for the delay in responding.
I stayed up late last night.
I don't know how this happened again.
I need a hacksaw to finish this job.
Ask him the way to station.
I decided not to do it.
They had an argument.
I suggest you get a lawyer.
He's busy and can't meet with you.
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
Are you going to kiss me?
For someone who's supposed to be an expert, you don't seem to know much.
Take a walk.
What are you watching?
This will do for the time being.
I'll be back late tonight.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
Go and get me some milk.
I know the potential consequences.
My sister likes painting.
I'm alone in the world.
What did you just write in your notebook?
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
It was the happiest time of my life.
Have you gone mad?
I wish I knew the answer to this question.
He can play tennis very well.
You need someone to help you, don't you?
Give them to me.
Tom didn't know where Mary wanted to spend her summer vacation.
The fight lasted three seconds.
For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
It's really different from what I expected.
How fast does this car go?
Would you like another glass of wine?
Do you think it's dangerous for me to swim across the river?
I play tennis once in a while.
I think something scared Tom.
French is not all that difficult to learn.
What has become of your sister?
We can handle that.
The news can't all be bad.
I really like your paintings.
I was absolutely stunned.
Have you ever been abroad?
Will it be fine tomorrow?
Tom scored a goal.
I usually went to the movies on Sunday.
I haven't told Tom anything.
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation.
Is that still my room?
I hear that he eats frogs.
Come what may, I won't change my opinion.
He whipped out his sword.
Stir the paint with a stick.
As soon as we get the answer, we'll phone you.
This train is made up of seven cars.
He was a brave warrior who had spent most of his life fighting his enemies.
I thought I was going crazy.
Write with your left hand.
Children need many things, but above all they need love.
I think it's time for me to mow the lawn.
You're very angry.
We stayed at our uncle's.
You're out of booze.
They don't like this either.
Did Tom find it?
We had no customers, so we shut the shop early.
This is an incredible result.
I'm sure you don't want to do that.
Is there any salt left?
We've had this discussion already.
I wish I could be more spontaneous.
You can go there.
Wasn't it supposed to snow last night?
The risk is too great.
Who cares about me?
My father is intelligent.
Have you ever been in love?
I'm glad I invited you.
Rabies is the deadliest disease on earth.
He sang some old songs.
Do you want to argue about it?
What you did was wrong.
Are you going to work until 10:00?
I can't wait to eat it.
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.
Don't use this faucet.
Tom needed to go home early.
I thought you might like to know where we'll be going next weekend.
Who's speaking?
Did Tom actually do everything he said he did?
Keep your head low.
You have changed so much that I can hardly recognize you.
Why would I want to sue you?
Will it stop raining soon? "I'm afraid not."
I can't find my bag.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
You're still growing.
Where's your grandmother?
The cat ruined my sofa.
Something's wrong with the dishwasher.
I didn't know that at the time.
What did they bring me?
The food was great in Italy.
I glanced through the brochure.
That's really impressive.
You need to hit the gym.
Do you think students are given enough time to eat lunch?
She plays Bach.
You're very curious.
You've got to be bold!
No one admires him more than I do.
I suppose that's a possibility.
I'd like to study French.
I thought they wouldn't like you.
You should take singing lessons.
Why did you want to speak with us?
Do you know what to do if there's a fire in the building?
I think I can prove it.
I wanted to be a piano teacher.
This is just a symptom of a much bigger problem.
Have they responded?
I'm happy for you both.
How did you get the idea?
Please keep my place in this line.
You two had a fight today, didn't you?
After the meal, I asked for the bill.
He was small, but strong.
I want those back when you're done.
I was trapped in a vicious circle.
Your answer is far from perfect.
How could they have done it?
I don't know my neighbors.
Did I hurt your feelings?
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
She advised him not to use too much salt.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
Is this one the bus for Oxford?
I like skiing much better than swimming.
It's not possible to live on that island.
Do I look happy to you?
He retired to his own room after supper.
Why don't we think about this for another week or so?
What time is it by your watch?
No one can go in there.
My friend helped me.
This is all so strange.
He invented an excuse for being late.
We should organize a party.
He saved a hundred dollars.
I've lost my key.
I know what you are thinking.
He's a freshman.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
I brought mine.
I thought Tom was still at home.
It's a pity when somebody dies.
I figured you might change your mind.
I think it wouldn't be too hard to come up with a better system.
I can't explain anything.
If the phone rings again, I plan to ignore it.
I want a family.
Was it interesting?
I want to study German.
Try to sleep.
They couldn't find the problem.
Tom has decided to take the day off.
It could be fun.
You know the drill.
This is the place where the incident happened.
I didn't know you then.
He is proud of his collection.
I'll show you the way out.
Exercise outdoors.
You can still change your mind.
They are at 229 Broadway Avenue.
Are you sure you're not tired?
All great men are dead and I am not feeling too well myself.
Your answer is right.
Can you help me move the sofa?
I suppose everyone thinks I'm being a little too picky.
His house is there on the right.
They can't all be bad.
There is an urgent need for better communication.
He traveled throughout the country.
Could you get in touch with him?
She talks everything over with her parents.
Thanks for the help. "Don't mention it."
It didn't really hurt.
I'm having a bad day.
Don't you tell me my job.
You can go there.
It's certainly a waste of time.
Make sure the door is locked.
They all changed.
She demanded to see the manager.
Tom isn't very athletic.
He helped me carry the chair.
I can't go any farther.
He advanced his departure by two days.
Did you buy it on the black market?
That day will go down in history.
All their efforts were in vain.
Give me one good reason.
I just do what I'm told.
Her father has a general store.
Monopolies are bad.
Are you here often?
It's unbearably hot.
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
It's really big.
Have you seen him before?
I like this one even better.
Why don't you look it up in the phone book?
What's so special about this?
What fruit do you like the best?
I was sober.
I don't have time for this now.
I'm sick and tired of eating zucchinis every day.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
Why do you think he said so?
Are you going to open the envelope?
She forced him to do it.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you are happy.
I can't wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this.
He is no ordinary student.
He stuck to his promise.
I'm finished with you.
Night is when most people sleep.
I suppose you have a plan.
I can't figure out how to operate this machine.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
Why don't you sit here a moment?
They walked along a narrow path.
You don't have to explain.
I don't like it when you swear.
He nudged me to go ahead.
The artist always painted alone.
I'm not really that surprised.
He denied it.
Fortunately he didn't die in the accident.
They lost.
Was there a lot of traffic?
Keep an eye on my suitcase while I buy my ticket.
Tom and Mary are still young.
Is he American?
Do you trust anyone?
Don't worry.
Two, four, six and eight are even numbers.
You are a good person.
That's all we want.
Take care of this.
I like doing this.
I forgot the book.
Is your sister older than you?
I'm not sure I can trust him.
You have very nice lips.
They want to kill me.
It is about time I was going.
He walked at a quick pace.
I haven't paid for the tickets yet.
Tom didn't offer me anything to drink.
You aren't permitted to bring dogs into this building.
Tom looks a lot like someone I know.
Are you looking?
He was given the benefit of the doubt.
Please tell me what you heard.
Between us, he is a little foolish.
I haven't heard from him for ages.
He doesn't watch television at all.
She doesn't have any children, does she?
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
I forgot to tell you something.
Look again.
She tried to persuade him to go with her.
Maybe I shouldn't do that.
He has completely avoided being sentimental.
How much longer will we have to wait?
Could you gift wrap it?
If you're tired, rest.
Are you absolutely sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
You're not supposed to be in here.
He is sure to succeed.
The workmen arrived early, bringing their ladders.
Tom doesn't believe a word of what Mary just said.
Do you think I should go by myself?
Would you like to sleep a little longer?
Frankly, I don't like your idea.
The water was warm.
She is more wise than clever.
Please note that the price is subject to change.
You must read the textbook closely.
We weren't invited to the party.
Turn the page.
You must find work.
They treat their employees well.
I want your love.
The problem's being looked into as I speak.
Tom plays tennis three times a week.
I thrust my hand into my pocket.
He gave in.
I've been in trouble before.
You're the only one for me now.
You're too trusting.
I was too tired to walk any more.
I didn't want to speak French.
Do you really think Tom was mistaken?
She congratulated me on my success.
That's one of my weaknesses.
Nothing happened between us.
You'd better go home at once.
I don't know whether to accept or refuse.
Click on the link.
My hard drive is almost full.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
I must have it shortened.
I don't like your friends.
You don't seem very sure.
I'm not sure I like this.
Tom wanted Mary to cooperate.
You're not invincible.
Let me ask you a stupid question.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I don't want to be rich. I just don't want to be poor.
He demanded that I should pay the money back at once.
I eat meat almost every day.
Are you sleepy?
I never thought about it before.
Millions of people in the United States are unemployed.
You get used to it.
I'm not totally convinced of that.
There's no doubt that he's innocent.
The situation seemed hopeless.
Don't waste my time asking stupid questions.
I want you to stay a little longer.
Why are you so annoyed?
Be punctual.
Could you repeat that?
I know that you're happy.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
I hope the meeting went well.
We were just about to enter the room.
I've rented an apartment.
I can scarcely believe it.
Tom was the first person here.
I wonder if he loves me.
You only really need to sound exactly like a native speaker if you want to become a spy.
Is that going to happen soon?
I itch everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary have already eaten.
I found the test difficult.
I expect him to come along any day now.
When in Rome, do as the Romans.
We need more data.
The station is a three-minute walk from here.
Good for you.
I answered for him.
Thanks for the reminder.
He often laughs at his own jokes.
How did you end up here?
That's what I'm saying.
Could you tell me how to adjust the volume?
I want to watch this.
We don't have a moment to lose.
What did you do exactly?
You can use my car if you drive carefully.
Do you have a hunting license?
Your mother loves me.
They've had enough.
I did it for you.
I'm sick of your excuses.
Do you have the book?
I'm not done.
You are on the wrong plane.
Everybody calls me Tom.
I go to school by bicycle.
Isn't that right?
The audience was predominantly female.
I know you've got more important things to think about.
Do exactly as I say.
Soldiers shared their food with the Indians.
Tom asked Mary to do that, so you don't have to.
I don't know why you're all so upset.
Look at the blackboard.
Are you doing anything special this evening?
Tom made me get out of bed.
I don't know how else to say it.
I hope you're happy.
Tom wants to come with us.
With the approach of Christmas, business improved somewhat.
Almost no one believed him.
I figured you'd want to know.
He is complaining about something or other all the time.
You'll find a job.
Tom is handcuffed.
She's about the same age as me.
You're a dreamer.
What are you getting so upset about?
All I want is for you to be happy.
I think it's time to leave.
Yesterday, Mary cleaned the house and washed clothes.
It is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands.
I figured that would make you laugh.
Why are you asking these questions?
I thought I was your best friend.
I go shopping every morning.
Rather than cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
How many proverbs have we learned so far?
Thank you for making it so easy.
We’ve been waiting for hours.
I really like hard boiled eggs.
Nobody told me you were here.
No sooner had she caught sight of me than she started running in my direction.
There is too much furniture in the house.
Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
I thought you'd want to see this.
The room is spacious and light.
We can't go anywhere today.
Did you say something?
Are you the bank manager?
I must have lost it.
That was the worst movie ever.
I'm hardly ever home.
He suggested a plan similar to mine.
They showed the scene in slow motion.
I don't want you to get involved.
How long will the operation take?
It's all I know.
He was a bit late.
What is in the garden?
She has a 10 percent interest in the company.
They are jealous of our success.
He's now short of money.
I was born in Osaka.
None of the victims' names have been released.
What do they need?
I'll wait for you in my room.
What are we waiting for?
It was a very difficult story to write.
I know all this.
Is everybody having a good time?
Could we have a minute of silence?
How long have you been out of prison?
I want to eat steak.
Can I borrow your computer?
You're not totally blameless.
It is necessary to prepare for the worst.
This is the cheaper of the two.
I've learned to think like Tom thinks.
We painted the house green.
Don't stand too close.
Don't deceive me.
I said no.
That may not be necessary.
You don't have to explain.
Tom is worried sick about Mary.
Keep your hands off my daughter!
This was not the deal.
May I have another piece of cake?
Does Tom know what happened?
You should pay attention to his story.
Tom was one of the lucky ones.
He took off his clothes.
We should be better than this.
If you heat ice, it melts.
Get into your car.
I'm not sure I want that.
I bought a hat.
My brother eats twice as much as I do.
I'm putting all my effort into this project.
What do you want?
I love movies.
I think I should probably go home and get some sleep.
I didn't really want to help.
Is there a photo shop in the hotel?
My mother spends a lot of money on clothes.
You don't have a fever.
Tom wondered what Mary would say if she knew he had spent the past week in Boston with Alice.
Tom bought Mary some food.
The more I sleep, the less I feel like working.
I'd like to try this.
That store sells newspapers and magazines.
That is no business of yours.
Thank you for calling.
Why not let Tom try?
The third quarter GNP growth was 1% over the preceding quarter.
Was your family with you last month?
I still need to use these things, so please don't take them away.
May I be excused for a minute?
Tom watched Mary cook dinner.
Each of us has to be careful when driving.
He lives off the grid.
Tom was shot in the head.
I'm very disappointed in you.
He will never live up to his parent's expectations.
Can we speak now?
I come here as often as I can.
I can't help but laugh when I think about that.
My GPS works very well.
Have you done this before?
English is spoken in many countries.
The contract will expire soon.
Where were you when I needed you?
He has a strong will.
I thought we had an agreement.
What's with everybody?
He said it as a joke.
Compared with the old model, this is far easier to handle.
I'm in the mood for something sweet.
I rode a horse for the first time yesterday.
They're all thieves.
They accept students like Tom.
No one is there.
How do you know they're looking for us?
She's never fallen in love.
What are some foods you usually eat with a knife and fork?
I thought you could swim.
It was worth every penny.
My mother gets up earlier than anyone else.
Tom started clearing the table.
Where's the catch?
May I call you tomorrow?
I once saw a man walk barefoot over hot coals.
No one got hurt.
Who is behind the plot?
I have a passport.
Tom seems to have lost his key.
He never saw his father again.
He leaned over her and said, "No, I'm not lying."
It is uncertain whether he will agree or not.
I like you a great deal.
I am going to the swimming pool.
Tom hid behind a tree.
I was the last to know.
Do you have health insurance?
Please don't leave me here by myself.
Do you understand how serious this is?
I never work during weekends.
Our business is expanding.
Aren't you a banker?
I will get it for you.
Please answer my question.
Is Tom absent today?
This is the very best way to do it.
I got there ahead of time.
You said you were going to handle it.
How much did you pay?
Tom sent a text message to a girl he liked in his class.
I hope you're happy.
I want to see what I'm up against.
There is an urgent message for you.
I have a glass eye.
You've got nothing to be scared of.
I didn't realize you were awake.
Tom likes watching TV in the evening.
Do I have to pay you?
Exercise is good for your health.
You're quite attractive.
How much is your hourly pay?
We need to be prepared.
You should leave, Tom.
Be quiet while I am speaking.
Something wasn't right.
Please tell me you're joking.
I think I have an idea.
Give Tom what he wants.
Please give me that book.
Which eye is hurting you?
I think I'm going back to sleep.
We still have more work to do.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
He despised those who lived on welfare.
Tonight is the night.
What a nerve!
She advised him to go to the hospital.
I'm still not sure.
He is sure of success.
I'll see you at the party.
If you really cared about your girlfriend, you would respect her feelings.
I haven't finished reading this book.
It's far too small.
We were all so busy then.
I was told that I needed to get enough sleep.
When does the plane leave?
Tom doesn't want to be late.
He began to cry.
Please close the window.
You'd better not wait here.
You're worried, aren't you?
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
It is kind of you go out of your way to help me.
We have a very serious problem.
There was a heavy rain yesterday.
You don't have to eat it.
Let's take a break.
Hemingway enjoyed big game hunting in Africa.
Have you finished reading that novel?
Why am I not surprised?
One of the dogs is alive.
I wouldn't try that again.
I wish you had come with us.
She thinks highly of him.
Have you ever been to New York?
The storm didn't cause any damage.
The last thing I want to do is cause you any problems.
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
We'll handle this.
There's no way to predict what you will dream tonight.
The plane crash was only last week.
I made a bad decision.
We really enjoyed that.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I'll take a nap after lunch.
How did I get here?
I'm not your servant.
We didn't learn a thing.
This place is worth visiting twice.
Finally, I have my own car.
Are you still not convinced?
I'm too tired to swim.
It's morally repugnant.
They seem surprised.
Do you want an orange?
The girl closed her eyes and listened to the pastor.
I might vote for you.
I don't think I can make it to your party.
Keep in touch.
We're not killers.
Tom shares his office with Mary.
Back off.
I don't think I can fix it.
He did not expect to live so long.
The game is over.
This is your fate.
Drive on.
It turned out that I was right.
She is not herself today.
Visiting Tom was a mistake.
You should receive them by the end of the week.
We were both drunk.
We should have gotten married.
I borrow books from the city library.
Tom explained his plan to Mary.
He ordered me to stand up.
He turned the key.
No one takes us seriously.
Does that mean you'll stay?
I prefer reading to writing.
It was out of his reach.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
He admitted his mistakes.
Hello!
What are you supposed to do?
Do you have a family?
Since there were no taxis, I had to walk.
I would never hurt a child.
Where do you park?
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
Something's going on here.
I take pride in what I do.
Were you busy last week?
It is probable that she will come.
You're alone, aren't you?
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
I will show you some pictures.
What do I call you?
Don't be so greedy.
She answered with a nod.
Let's go to the mall tonight.
This book hasn't yet been translated into French.
What's troubling you?
It happens more often than you would think.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I speak English every day.
A large crowd of people gathered.
Why aren't you coming with us?
She has a son everybody loves.
Give me a day or two.
I passed by four houses.
Does anybody else feel that?
I couldn't stop laughing.
How about running?
It's not polite to point at others.
You need to be careful.
We watched a baseball game on television.
It isn't easy to understand why you want to leave.
Habits are difficult to break.
I can live with that.
I'm so full.
The thieves hid in the woods.
I've got no reason to stay.
How exactly am I supposed to do that?
You gave Tom the money he asked for, didn't you?
I want to apologize.
What choice do we have?
Don't judge a man by his clothes.
I've got this all under control.
Avoid fried foods for a while.
Are you good at cooking?
I fix broken radios.
Both countries are now at peace.
I'm halfway through this crime novel.
He studied as hard as anybody in his class.
I was here when you came in.
It was nothing serious.
Whose notebook is that?
A man began to follow Tom.
Tom leaned on the counter.
He died from lack of oxygen.
The price isn't important.
I really enjoyed that.
We're headed in the right direction.
He did as I told him.
I can't eat pork.
He speaks ten languages.
I only need one thing.
I regret this decision already.
They had a heated discussion.
Can you forget your native language?
I'm one of you.
Tom doesn't live with his wife anymore.
Which do you like better, the sea or the mountains?
She prides herself on her skill in cooking.
Tom began praying.
Don't lose your sense of humor.
Have you seen Tom lately?
One of you is lying.
He doesn't like the heat of the summer.
They were not pleased.
The sun has not risen yet.
Just observe your cat and you will get to know him.
It's your duty to finish the job.
I just told everybody the good news.
I know that you're doing your best.
I could be away for some time.
We're looking forward to the holidays.
Tom must be proud of you.
You can borrow three books at a time.
I play in a band.
She's rolling in money.
I don't have a weapon.
He started to cry.
Who gave the command?
I was alone.
I prefer French films to American ones.
It wouldn't take all that long to explain.
He donated countless pieces to the museum.
The dirty boy turned out to be a prince in disguise.
What a mess!
I expect everyone to work hard.
I met his sister last week.
She got her master's degree three years ago.
Tom sings off key.
A bunch of people told me not to eat there.
Why did you go home?
He jumped from one subject to another.
Are you lost?
You gave me your word that you would look after them.
I felt embarrassed at first.
Have you seen my pen?
Their cattle are all fat.
Will he recover soon? "I hope so."
I still love you.
Are you the mayor?
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
You are blinded by love.
It's on the house.
What's your favorite war movie?
The apple tree has a beautiful blossom.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
I haven't attended any of his conferences.
That's a good thing to have.
I sometimes hear my father singing in the bathroom.
Do you want to do it?
Don't tell him the answer.
I had nowhere to go.
I don't trust you.
What part of Australia do you come from?
I find you very attractive.
The two girls wore the same dress to the dance.
Mine is better than yours.
He never saw his sister again.
It's perfect.
I'm a good guy.
That isn't allowed.
She advised him to give up smoking.
Today is very cold.
The sun went down behind the mountains.
I thought you'd be different.
Where's the hospital?
He must be about forty.
Tom Jackson is my favorite writer.
I'm sorry.
Tom never seems to know what to say.
I was doing an impersonation of my boss when he showed up.
Visitors are welcome.
Most young people have mobile phones.
My house is on the west side of the street.
I can do that for you if you want me to.
He blew on the tip of his fingers.
Please put this where children can't reach it.
I want the absolute truth.
I wish I knew how to play the trombone.
The man who is constantly making decisions and being compelled to alter them gets nowhere.
I don't like this game.
The novel takes place in Victorian England.
What if something goes wrong?
Whoever wants it may take it.
He has no common sense.
I sing at church.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
No one wants to admit it.
I watch TV now and then.
Run!
I prefer plain materials.
What happened to Tom? Is he dead?
We had to stop.
The flowers smell so good.
I want to buy a new computer.
I don't want to face that alone.
Baby teeth are sharp.
I don't remember that happening.
He came to Tokyo in search of employment.
I know how to solve the problem, but I've been asked not to tell you.
Two problems remained unsolved.
Things are getting out of hand.
Don't act like that.
I'll never deceive you.
I can't show you.
She is a friend of mine.
You can visit NHK any time.
They keep calling.
I trust Tom's judgment.
Have a nice day, Tom.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
Please don't cry.
This is the best pen.
Our local TV station does a pretty good job of covering local news.
Just tell them no.
How do you tell them apart?
That's a lot to remember.
It was not an accident.
No one got sick.
He refused to give them the information.
Maybe it was just a nightmare.
He set out for Tokyo this morning.
It's a huge mistake.
I broke it.
Let's play a new game.
Tom acted the part of a sailor.
It took courage to sail across the Pacific single-handed.
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
May I have a class schedule?
You're very talented.
The box isn't empty.
I get hives when I eat eggs.
We're not the only ones doing it.
Is it possible that you're wrong?
My father has been in good shape since his operation.
Don't spoil your child.
We heard screaming outside.
Ask Tom where he bought his hat.
That might change soon.
Watch your toes.
You got here fast.
I'll tell you exactly what to say.
I want these.
Don't make the same mistake twice.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
I want you to be quiet.
He missed the deadline.
You are very insensitive.
I didn't do it for you.
What do you say we buy everyone a drink?
When do you use it?
She has a passion for cake.
Ask Tom what we should do next.
May I use the toilet?
We sacrifice a lot.
We wanted you.
Do you have a pen?
When I was feeding my dog, I noticed that the gate had been left open.
You're good with kids.
What are those pills called?
Stop playing with that.
I wasn't consulted.
She is dressed in white.
I'm nervous when speaking in another language.
Ask them.
Tom's not here.
I'm just watching TV.
Stir the soup.
I'm glad I did it.
I'm stubborn.
Speak clearly and make yourself heard.
Few people will admit their faults.
You're acting like a child.
Can't you reach the book on the shelf?
Why are you so insecure?
I'm glad Tom was there with me.
I don't speak fast.
Tomorrow morning will be OK.
I want a refund.
The patient has no pulse.
I'll wait for you in here.

Stealing is wrong.
You should not go alone.
I can carry that for you.
All I want is your cat.
I think you need to leave now.
May I call on you today?
This is a dirty movie.
I intended to have finished the work.
We have to stop.
The conditions were difficult.
We discussed it last night.
Don't tell me what I already know.
Gold is heavier than silver.
It's so good to finally meet you.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I never get invited to parties.
The enemy attacked the town.
We saw you.
She advised him to keep his promises.
He is wearing gloves.
People should have realistic expectations.
I haven't done that since last Monday.
He easily gets angry.
Tom always talks about money.
Are you good at tennis?
I see they've put you to work.
Are you speaking to me?
He kept his promise.
I got confused.
It seems we are in the same boat.
How do these things work?
I think it's time for me to wash my car.
You're not alone anymore.
Is this your room?
You shouldn't talk back like that.
Tom likes classical music.
I appreciate the help.
That's enough for today.
In France, voting isn't mandatory.
Open the safe.
I look forward to seeing them this spring.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
How do you account for that?
It was sort of fun.
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.
Weigh your words well.
Please look at me.
Come to lunch with us.
Tom grabbed his coat.
She struggled to get up.
That was a great movie.
I want to make that very clear.
They told me I had to help you.
That is insane. Only a fool would believe that.
They're not dead.
I got what you wanted.
He is the head of marketing.
He kept his promise and helped his brothers.
Tell Tom I'll pick him up on the way.
Cut it out, Tom.
I like your shoes.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
Look at the meter.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
May I go out to play?
He is taking a walk.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
We lost, but we had fun.
Many lost their homes during the earthquake.
I think Tom probably doesn't like you very much.
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to lock the door.
I imagine that you went through a lot of difficulties.
I fell when I was running.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
That's what I'd try to do.
Please do not kill me.
Will you give it to me?
There was no one else on the road.
I broke his heart, but I love him.
I can peel an apple.
The sun is in the sky.
Are you alone?
I'll accept suggestions.
You were perfect.
The view is beautiful beyond words.
You can read this book.
Please read the instructions.
Tom lied to you, didn't he?
I can't put up with that loud noise.
This is big.
It's completely natural.
Put your valuables in the safe.
She laid her baby on the bed.
The smell is persistent.
Who are we working for?
She helped him.
Do you have any ideas about it?
One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Now eat your supper.
That is why I am angry with him.
He can't be ill.
Here's your change.
Yes, we can go.
Tom is cautious.
He looks down on women.
Tom doesn't know how to cook very well.
Tom is going to try again.
She smiled at the sight of her mother.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
I thought you might want a drink.
Well, how did it happen anyway?
What's your favorite class this year?
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
My aunt grows tomatoes in her garden.
Above all, you must help each other.
Tom won't let you go.
You don't know what this means to us.
I am not studying now.
You're smarter than me.

I've never seen such a beautiful girl.
I really don't feel like talking right now.
I think you're nuts.

This is sometimes called the walk of shame.
Japanese women marry at 26 on average. It is no mystery that the birthrate is declining.
I'm afraid it will rain.
They're staring at you.
I wish today were Friday.
How's the project going?
Tom didn't even know who that was.
He ignored his father's advice.
You're very nice.
I didn't want to postpone our meeting.
I'm quite tired.
I don't like the way she speaks to me.
Where are all our suitcases?
I have a stone in my shoe.
Tom told Mary that their relationship was over.
I got dealt a bad hand.
There were hundreds of people milling about in the streets.
It could be a trap. Don't let your guard down.
Does the story have a happy ending?
I often play soccer after school.
Tom lost his job.
Are you suggesting that we impersonate policemen?
I think it's unlikely that I'll be able to pass my driving test.
At what hour was she born?
He went to see her in the hospital every other day.
Customer satisfaction is our number one priority.
We worried a lot about you.
Tom goes to school five days a week.
I had no idea of what she intended to do.
Don't you think I know my own brother?
That's lame.

When did you get there?
Try not to spend so much time complaining about things you can't change.
Your bicycle is better than mine.

There was only one left.
How many pencils do you have?
I saw him jump.
He confessed his guilt.
I think that's awful.
You're too young to know what a slide rule is.
What did I do that for?
I'll get it.
I'm surprised they didn't have anything to do.
I don't want you to enjoy it.
Don't take it personally.
What has Tom been accused of?
Tom didn't seem serious.
Those are my pants.
I don't believe a word of what people have been saying about her.
Clear off the table.
Fully booked for the night, the hotel had to turn away some late guests.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
See what happens when you give people advice?

Can't we discuss this?
We appreciate your help.
Concerning this matter, I'm the one to blame.
More than 70 percent of the inhabitants are in favor of the program.
Say what you have to say.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.

Why don't you take a break?
I want to know where they hid the money.
The more chocolate you eat, the fatter you'll get.

Is there a lot left to do?
Let's move on to another topic.

Are you sure about that?
I'll go change my clothes.

It was on the morning of February the ninth that I arrived in London.
The challenges are daunting, but we can overcome them.
Do you think it'll be hard to do that?

I got there in time for the train.
They abandoned the ship.
Normally, I'm not afraid of planes.
We don't want any freeloaders around here.

The baby cried all night.
He may have missed the plane.
Stop the car.
It seems that our sense of direction is not always reliable.
You may be right.
I can't count the number of times Tom has complained about that.
We should be there by noon.
It's really awesome.
I want to start over.
He isn't here, is he?
Why did you invite Tom to the party?
Tom wanted way too much money.
What language do they speak in the United States?

This is not expensive.
We left no stone unturned.
We don't want Tom to go.
You've taken everything.
I got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
You're surrounded.
I was planning on it.
I took the opportunity to visit Rome.
This is where the fun begins.
Who wants a piece of cake?
You will need a key.
Would you consider this a good proposal?
It's your turn to sing.
I have to exercise.
Don't come to me now with that. You should have said something when it originally happened.
It was all over.
Why do you want to leave today?
She lost her locker key while she was swimming in the pool.
She asked him how to turn on the machine.
I am sure of his success.
It is up to me to tell the sad news to her.
Tom allowed me to go.
I've been very impressed.
That's logical.
He was holding a pen in his hand.
I had other things on my mind.
What would you like me to do?
She advised him to read more books.
Are you motivated?
These trees were planted by them.
It was quite funny.

He had one of his socks on inside out.
I said maybe.
Both you and I should lose a little weight.
Does Tom also live on this street?
I love all my children equally.
What do you plan on doing with the money?
Stop!
He offered more than could be expected.
She's a determined woman.
I have enough money to buy it.
I have a lot to do today.
Do you like French opera?
Try to be more punctual from now on.
Has Tom been fired?
We'll find a way to use it.
I'll be leaving now.
Do you know when Mozart died?
Do you like singing?
I don't even know who has stolen what.
This is strictly a private matter.
We look forward to working more closely with you in the future.
Tom says a lot of things.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
We've made a deal.
Why should I interfere?
Mind your own business!
Are they dead?
I have a brain tumor.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
I believed you.
I'm sometimes careless.
We're prisoners.
I heard that there were alligators in the sewers.
I'll explain the matter to you later on.
Good luck to you!
I am in charge here.
I couldn't have done anything without Tom's help.
I need a soldering iron.
I think you did a good job.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
She liked it.
Let's give Tom some privacy.
Where did you find such an ugly hat?
Will you be in Boston this weekend?
You enjoyed that, didn't you?
Why are you flinching?
Tom, this is my cousin.
Who was that you were just talking to?
You have to wait.
You could stop this.
I'm going to send Tom some money.
I have no reason to lie to you.
He is my neighbor, but I don't know him well.

I thought you'd never ask.
My sister has a piano.
Tom bought a used car.
She will try it.
Everyone says that the food at this restaurant is very good.
Give me a minute, please.
My brother is three years younger than me.
That's all it takes.
Try to open the door.
My mother is cooking breakfast.
Fishing is prohibited here.
I'm afraid she will fail.
To tell the truth, I drove my father's car without his permission.
I lost track of the time.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
Here's what you wanted.
We’ve been waiting for hours.
There's nothing new under the sun.
You still haven't told me why you're here.
People love freedom.
He turned to his friends for help.
I'm not very good at chess.
Avoid it at all cost.
Good morning, everybody.
It's a small town in the middle of nowhere.
He's in grave danger.
I ate lunch with Tom.
Five plus three is eight.
Let's get some food.
We lost.
She said that it might be true.

He was unaware of the danger.
I'm not mad.
Dozens of letters are awaiting you.
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you.
I can't explain the difference between those two.
What's the last thing you remember?
Can I ask why?
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
He stood face to face with his enemy.
Is it yours?
Only a handful of people know the fact.
We remember.
I was stung by a bee.
There were too many of them.
I was told I shouldn't do that.
They were yours.
I go to the movies every week.
I know that Tom is a racist.
She is very fond of gossip.
You need to respect the elderly.
My teeth are totally healthy and free of problems.
I want to talk to him about it.
I know what not to eat.
We need a victory.
There is no air on the moon.
I'm pleased with his performance.
Now, what else can I do for you?
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
I'm sure there'll be no problem.
I could sense that Tom was upset.
Aren't you at least curious?
Stay out of my kitchen.
I want to know what you mean.
Although it was raining, I had to go out.
You can't have both of them.
The water was cut off yesterday.
We must fix this.
Where's the train station?
What time did you close the store last night?
Tom ate the rest of the pizza.
Can you remember anything?
Tom is going to do something about it.
Why are you so pale today?
She had something to talk over with him.
He must find work.
Who did you go with?
Are they able to read these words?
Keep reading.
I want them all shot.
It's not what he said, but the way he said it.
Listen to this!
You can't be hungry. You've just had dinner.
I'll call you at noon.
I didn't go to the funeral.
You don't seem to realize how serious this is.
I was trying to prove something.
Could you please overlook it this time?
Are you alone?
This year is going to be prosperous.
He agreed to give us an interview.
What are the symptoms?
It appears to me that you are right.
Don't believe her because she always lies.
What's your age?
I'm dehydrated.
This vending machine takes only hundred-yen coins.
Tom made good money on that deal.
I'd like to think about it a little longer before I make a decision.
Keep out!
Is that machine still usable?
Is he back already?
Are you going outside?
He can't sing.
I'm a French teacher.
Please don't forget the receipt.
Tom wanted to be sure.
How was the universe formed?
I finally found time to sit down and read the newspaper.
Please play something by Chopin for me.
Would you accept those terms?
You are drunk!
All the boys in class worked hard.
How do you remember that?
He had long hair last year.
Please be honest.
He seems to know nothing about the matter.
A soldier often has to confront danger.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
Why are you so interested in him?
I'm not convinced at all.
Let's play by ourselves.
I'm going to the convenience store.
You can't defeat me.
This company sold unsafe products.
I promise you I'll help you.
He didn't make public what he had discovered there.
Are you enthusiastic?
Did anyone else feel that?
I've finished reading the book.
I dislocated my shoulder.
I was abducted by aliens.
You may go anywhere.
That just goes to prove that you are a liar.
He writes scripts.
Please give me a piece of paper to write on.
I hadn't thought of that.
Are you still hungry?
Tom wants to go to Australia.
I appreciate you being here.
I want to see you.
He comes from England.
Everybody loved Tom.
May I go to bed?
I couldn't live with that kind of uncertainty.
I don't like being controlled.
Tom is merciless.
I want the same jacket as you are wearing.
They don't have to answer.
You don't seem very concerned.
You are always complaining.
Is that why you want to hurt me?
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
He was weak from the loss of blood.
I like working with you.
He stayed at a hotel for a couple of days.
I swim every day.
Tom is in a good mood today.
You are taller than me.
We never forget.
I also wanted to know.
They were surprised by what they saw.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Tom doesn't trust us.
He's a man you can rely on.
A fire broke out last night.
Thanks very much for having me to dinner the other night.
I just don't want anyone to be mad at me.
None of the old trees survived the fire.
Come inside.
I'm not nervous at all.
I work during the night.
Why don't you get a job?
The young people are fed up with the politics of this country.
It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
He is a born poet.
You have to leave.
You raise a good point.
I found it difficult to make myself heard because of the noise.
The teacher has a great influence on his pupils.
Tell the truth to Tom.
Know your enemy.
I knew Tom would like Mary.
He suggested that we take a short rest.
Tom opened a window.
How many teeth does a cow have?
I wasn't busy yesterday.
I'll answer all your questions.
I didn't see any tigers.
Democracy is the dictatorship of the majority.
They're here until the end of the week.
The dogs bayed at the full moon.
He betrayed his country.
All three of us agree.
How old is your father?
You're not young anymore.
You've earned a rest.
You know the drill.
Need I go on?
No one believes that he is innocent.
Where did you go to school?
Let's be friends.
He left his parents when he was eight years old.
The call is free of charge.
That's encouraging news.
They complained of the room being too hot.
We're armed.
Tom told me you needed some money.
I'd like you to be my guest tonight.
I remember seeing her before.
I know you've been trying to help.
I'm allergic to corn.
I'll give them an answer tomorrow.
Tom is my only true friend.
I like that.
How many times a year do you go skiing?
Every student was asked one question.
She was playing the piano at that time.
She began to sing.
I'm not afraid of you.
Over-sleeping is no excuse for being late.
My cell phone has a built-in digital camera.
Tom works with Mary.
I visit him every other day.
I made a list of things I needed to bring with me.
Tom didn't tell his parents that he had gotten an F on the test.
How does your wife feel about it?
Have confidence in yourself.
How's that possible?
I'll never forget this experience.
We're really drunk.
The twins are as alike as two peas in a pod.
I want you to stop following me.
Can I make copies?
It's easy for him to make friends.
You don't sound very surprised.
What you're suggesting won't work.
We took shelter under a tree.
This salad is really good.
He's as blind as a bat.
I've never made this kind of mistake before.
You can use my bicycle.
I missed the last train last Friday.
I'd like you to meet my sister.
Scientists have found water on Mars.
Stay down.
I want to spend my life with you.
What are you interested in?
I've already eaten breakfast.
Don't worry about it!
I don't need a girlfriend.
We must always be ready.
She sat next to him and listened quietly.
I feel like smiling.
Do you plan to buy that car?
You must be sleepy.
At a glance, he knew that the child was hungry.
I'm in way over my head.
I can't carry a tune.
I don't negotiate.
What would you like me to do with this?
I never said that it wasn't a good idea.
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow.
I've seen that.
You're too loud.
Someone broke the window.
The baby cannot use a spoon yet.
He stared at me from head to foot.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
We miss you a lot.
I'm not the only person who couldn't do that.
I said nothing.
I didn't know Tom hated me so much.
Can you tell me where the restrooms are?
Tom didn't look that happy.
I'm familiar with the situation.
My hair is wet.
No one can help you, Tom.
Tom doesn't think it'll rain, but he plans to carry an umbrella just in case.
I won't hold it against you.
I owe you a favor.
I thought you'd be much fatter.
You look relaxed.
Come and keep me company.
Do you have any idea what happened?
I think we're neighbors.
I did what Tom told me to do.
Tom has something in his hand.
You're doing it right.
I think you must be getting tired.
I'm still your friend.
How long are you staying in Japan?
That's what we need.
She raised her hand for the bus to stop.
He'll be along in ten minutes.
Whose side are you on?
I know Tom is psyched.
The house is going to feel empty without you.
We're on speaking terms.
Come quickly!
Please close the door behind you.
He behaved like a child.
He has nothing to do.
I wouldn't want to miss this.
Where would you like to sit?
I just can't live without you.
I'm sloshed.
I'm not used to this heat.
The next day was Christmas Day.
He is a good singer.
I had hardly gotten into bed when the telephone began to ring.
They all killed themselves.
Time is on my side.
He threw the ball.
I changed the arrangement of the furniture in my room.
I didn't mean it like that.
You are late this morning.
That's what I meant.
What's Japan's longest river?
Tom said he wants to die.
Tom never talks about his family.
He is what we call a musical genius.
Who are you talking about?
Why hasn't anybody cleaned this up?
She knows better than to argue with him.
Make your bed.
I don't always follow instructions.
You're unambitious.
The weather is nice tonight.
Was anybody with you?
Thank you for all the gifts.
She accompanied me on the piano.
I know you're scared.
The weather has been good until today.
Everyone is interested in that.
It's about time I was going home.
Quit behaving like a kid.
I'll put some salt in the soup.
The thief is certain to be caught eventually.
Is this your locker?
Does Tom like French?
Do you want to tell the jury what happened?
I lost the watch.
She asked him if he was happy.
Please show me your picture.
Have you seen all these movies?
Regardless what he does, he does it well.
What's going to happen to our pets?
Do you have a passport?
We used to sit on these steps and talk.
Please let me go home.
What a cute girl!
Don't talk to me about religion.
I'll give you a piece of good advice.
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
It has rained since yesterday.
We listened to her for some time.
It is time you told her the truth.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
The Japanese government can't cope with the problem.
I'm very pleased to hear the news.
It's starting now.
May I accompany you on your walk?
Meeting my old friend was very pleasant.
How can this be real?
You're not bored, are you?
There is a place for everyone in the world.
I'm a fan of German opera.
I'm drunk, but I can still speak German.
Your cough worries me.
Students are supposed to study hard.
The wind has died down.
He did nothing but watch TV all day.
Could you write it down, please?
I think you're both right.
I like your style.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I couldn't tell her from sister.
There are no comments yet.
I would rather have tea than coffee.
Have something to eat.
Can you touch your toes without bending your legs?
He gave an excuse about why he had been absent.
I explained to the host that I had been delayed by a traffic jam.
I think it's time for you to leave.
You've found it.
I think I still have time for another cup of coffee.
How will you manage?
I'm not keeping this thing.
I suppose I could change a tire if I had to.
The older he grew, the more modest he became.
She greeted him waving her hand.
It's hard for him to live on his small pension.
Take a shower.
I think Tom could be persuaded to help.
I only need a minute.
You're shivering. Are you cold?
You're no singer.
How did you know that man was a cop?
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.
He has no house to live in.
That's a good idea.
Go on without me.
I'd be arrested if I did that.
I just want to make sure we all agree.
Can you make it on time?
That would be quite acceptable.
When my father came home, I was studying.
Your death will not have been in vain.
She showed me her new car.
How can I get to the police station?
I'd rather go for a walk than see the movie.
Human beings are social creatures.
What did they do to you?
He sleeps during the day and works at night.
She blames me for the fact that our married life isn't going well.
Did you see that?
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
I did it without consulting anyone.
How did you do this?
Don't come so early next time.
Are you laughing at me?
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I hope to marry her.
I'm supporting you.
I know every word on this page.
We eat many kinds of food.
You came too late.
I can't believe he kissed you.
There were no customers, so we closed the shop early.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
His heart is broken.
He is a fishmonger.
I don't know how to say it.
Have you decided?
It took me more than a week to put the model ship together.
Don't cut that wire.
Tom sat in front of us.
What did Tom put into the bag?
The island was struck by the typhoon.
The candle burned out.
That's the problem, I think.
Tom is wearing a black hat.
Who was the book written by?
Your replacement has already been picked.
His decision to stay there was a surprise to all of us.
You need to save the princess.
I think we can finish this later.
Tom behaved badly.
I hate rainy days.
Use acrylic paint.
Is that a threat?
I wish I had a friend like you.
I think Tom is generous.
I heard my phone ring.
The climate of New Zealand is similar to that of Japan.
I'm going to leave one night early.
Who knows what you'll find up in the attic?
I have nothing to say about that.
Stop dreaming.
Are you having any trouble breathing?
My younger sister didn't say "hello."
I remember it now.
I'm free this afternoon.
We're broke.
I wonder if she is married.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
I feel ashamed.
It will soon be breakfast time.
Things got out of hand.
The doll lay on the floor.
What's your dad's name?
It rained for hours and hours.
He's painting his house.
I'll go even if it rains heavily.
They love their children.
The room was warm.
There were no more free seats.
What are we supposed to do?
Where've you been all afternoon?
Don't take it personally.
I was the worst student in the class.
Eat your soup, please.
How was the fishing?
Drive on.
I don't want you to do that.
Hold on.
She sang pretty well.
No matter how bad it gets, she won't die from that disease.
He was accused of stealing money.
It looks a little heavy.
Tom had to wait a long time in the waiting room.
Let's be honest with each other.
We're also out of eggs.
I'm going downtown.
I couldn't stop laughing.
My father is going to kill me.
Why are you flinching?
You don't have to come.
My father runs a restaurant.
She looks confused.
He speaks Portuguese.
Is this your idea of a good time?
Tom is slow.
This is the last game.
He seldom counts his change.
Get the camera.
There should be more national hospitals for old people.
Come over to our table.
Look at Tom's shoes.
Think it over and let me know what you decide.
Can you please help me set the table?
Camping so near the river isn't a good idea.
This box is made of cardboard.
My mom likes my brother more than me.
There is a small garden in front of my house.
I wasn't talking about Tom.
You don't look like a doctor.
He will go to the meeting instead of me.
The birds flew to the south.
That's a student my father teaches.
This drink is on the house.
I don't know where I was born.
I think you should open an account here.
I'm already done.
I enjoyed it very much.
How did such a strange thing come about?
Do you like music?
Some were unwilling to fight.
I have to get home before it gets dark.
That's even better.
Can I offer you guys a ride?
I'm sick of you.
He tucked the handkerchief in his pocket.
I called her, but the line was busy.
When did you start learning German?
I like the sound of your voice.
Did Tom get hurt in the accident yesterday?
I want to participate.
The meeting was closed.
Do you have the key to this room?
Can you see the difference?
How can you be so cruel?
It appeared to me that he was very intelligent.
Tom wanted to dance with Mary.
Tom likes all vegetables except cabbage.
I've been studying French for a very long time.
I don't envy you.
I turned on the radio.
Several men are fishing from the riverbank.
I just remembered.
I wonder what happens if I press this button.
I think we can help each other.
Tom's leg was badly burned.
She has to pay for the book.
They're leaving.
I like listening to music.
Do you have a credit card?
The birds were hungry.
Arguing never got anyone anywhere.
Can you make me a snack?
I don't feel very happy.
Tom said that the soup was too hot.
Put it on my account.
I'm so happy to meet you.
His mother was a singer.
It is obvious that that is a lie.
I'm against the war.
Don't use too much glue.
The curtains are closed.
The theory is not accepted.
Tom looks a little uncomfortable.
I want you to get out of town.
She wouldn't speak to him.
He tied the dog to a tree.
Yours was better.
Who built it?
I'm going to protect you, Tom.
He ate all of the apple.
I think Tom said he'd be back.
The game will be played even if it rains.
The light has turned green.
What are the conditions?
Italian isn't difficult.
Let's take a 10-minute break.
They relaxed on the beach.
I like hanging out with you.
They are very interested in astronomy.
I didn't like my teacher.
He lives alone.
Get ready.
We had to react quickly.
I forgot my manners.
There are a lot of hot springs in Japan.
When did you finish writing the report?
Please help me cook.
None of us want that.
It's not so good.
You were always very kind.
Would you mind shutting the door?
I spent hours looking for the key that I had dropped.
Are you still married?
I'm accustomed to this.
I'm armed.
Why are you alone?
We never go to bed before midnight.
You're the one who trained me.
How old were you when you first did that?
Tom doesn't like working in the garden.
Graham Greene is one of my favorite authors.
What were you two doing?
I like to travel alone.
You look so cool.
He has never been abroad.
I'm not alone.
Of course, you're correct.
I want a cup of iced-tea.
I didn't go to the market.
He acknowledged me by lifting his hat.
Just a second. Let me finish.
Tom only had eyes for Mary.
I've got real feelings for you.
It might rain tomorrow.
May I be of service?
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
She did not read the book.
Which is your book, this one or that one?
They're going to try.
They all made fun of me.
Did you just insult me?
I need to know.
Were you blindfolded?
The escalator is broken.
Don't look so sad.
Did you tell Tom?
He looked very tired.
May I introduce myself to you?
I think it would be a good idea to go home early.
You don't have to be so rude.
I'll have to think about it.
We're trapped.
Don't think about it.
This is yours, isn't it?
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I have something to trade.
This heat is unbearable.
Have a good look at this picture.
Would you like one?
I only hope it is not too late.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
I had a little difficulty in getting a taxi.
I won't tell anybody.
Let's try to sleep.
She'll be having dinner with him at this time tomorrow.
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!
Could you hand me the newspaper on the table?
Your advice has been of great help.
He was right the first time.
I wonder if he will come.
Do you really want to get more done?
This is my old bike.
My mother cut the cake.
I had forgotten that.
I feel it now.
This is a wonderful achievement.
Aren't you guys sleepy?
Sit wherever you like.
I don't have any nice clothes.
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
The station is in the center of the city.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
It looks like you've regained your confidence.
Is there something you want to ask?
Tom told Mary to keep that a secret.
Did she show you the picture?
You should try to be more like Tom.
Are you lonely?
You'll break it if you're not careful.
He is impossible to beat.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
Don't raise my hopes like that.
What can I give you in return?
I hope Tom is objective.
Tom fell asleep waiting for Mary.
I don't want to talk to you about this.
I seldom see him.
Tom is drowning!
You watch too much TV.
I know that's not why you're here.
This directly concerns Tom.
Cosmetic surgery is not covered by most insurance plans.
I want very much for you to understand.
I can't dance either.
I wish I had more time to talk to her.
What part of Australia do you come from?
I don't plan on retiring yet.
How did we get into so much trouble?
Everyone is very proud of you.
Help yourself, please.
The lights went out.
Try some.
Which party do you belong to?
Tom likes that one.
Tom is always out of money.
You'll find it difficult to meet her requirements.
Her daughter is a nurse.
They're disposable.
I'm not sure that that's all true.
Tom has begun looking for a job.
I just moved here.
Don't push your luck.
Tickets are available here for $30.
I don't know you anymore.
All the desk drawers were empty.
You're looking very well.
I already speak French.
He broke his arm.
I'll be grateful to you if you can do that for me.
Here is your dog.
Don't be angry.
Did you get in trouble with your parents?
Those aren't mine.
I am not going anywhere.
Don't try anything funny.
Before going home, I have a few drinks to relax.
This is very impressive.
I also love to cook.
You must look after the child.
I don't think that's helping.
Tom wouldn't say yes.
Who can afford to buy such an expensive house?
I felt isolated.
We know what we have to do.
Tom often quarrels with his wife.
Tom promised never to do that again.
You're the best.
We can talk this through.
I stayed home all day long reading novels.
Whose son are you?
Is the cat all right?
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
Be sensible.
Do you hear any sound?
I can't thank you enough for the help you've given me.
I guess I'm really in trouble now.
Did you work yesterday?
You're very curious.
You should follow his advice.
We were all wondering why you were late.
They are both good.
You don't even try to help me.
I thank you for that.
I think we should wait.
I knew you would do something great.
I wish I were famous.
Are you going to invite Tom to the party?
This is getting awkward.
Do you know how to count to ten in French?
You are twice as strong as I am.
Why do you want that anyway?
Tom is good at public speaking.
What will the neighbors say?
I just want to cry.
Tom was sitting alone in his room.
It is not as good as it looks.
You're very understanding.
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
I didn't know that he was there.
We have enough time.
It is finally all over. Now we can relax.
I don't see how you can ignore this.
The basketball needs to be inflated.
I think it's time for me to abandon that plan.
I'm sure Tom will come tomorrow.
I turned right.
Would you like to see your room?
I'm pleased to meet you.
I think we'd better help Tom.
Search every room.
I met a man from Boston this afternoon.
You're elusive.
Tom is happy to finally be at home.
Can I talk to you for a second?
His father got records of bird songs for him.
She told him that she was leaving.
He is our teacher of English.
You're sneaky.
Are they speaking French?
This may take a while.
I've never met her.
This car is easy to handle.
I'm going to take my vacation in September rather than July.
They love their children.
I wish I could take back what I said.
Let's clean up this mess.
I saw him enter the store.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
Don't kill the messenger.
What Tom did was very stupid.
My mother made a sweater for me.
You missed a spot.
Show me what you bought.
Was the movie good?
He may have been ill.
Are you motivated?
Where's the money I gave you?
Show us the room.
Tom isn't really that old, is he?
Let's take the bus.
I made the best of my small room.
You should relax a bit.
He does not like to wait until the last moment to do a thing.
She earns her living by teaching.
My father works here.
I'm not all that drunk.
Tom put two slices of bread into the toaster and pushed down on the lever.
I'd like your permission to use it.
You can't leave me.
You're very brave.
They made fun of my accent.
That isn't the way I heard it.
A good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could in principle be disproved or falsified by observation.
Haiti is a nation that seems hopelessly impoverished.
Everything's all right now.
Please be careful.
He put the book on the table.
You don't look very comfortable.
I know that tune, but I can't remember the lyrics.
Tom is usually on time, but there have been times when he's been several hours late.
Tom has gotten himself into trouble before.
What are we eating for lunch today?
Tom told me to wait here.
I cried on his shoulder.
I didn't like that.
You'll have to ask someone else.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my mother.
This is the last game.
You'd better have your eyes examined.
We got stuck in a traffic jam, which made us twenty minutes late.
May I have a timetable?
I'm sorry that you couldn't come with us.
I don't have the patience for this.
He can swim on his back.
His girlfriend did it for him.
Take as much as you like.
Do you have everything?
Learning a foreign language is hard work.
The police think that Tom poisoned himself.
I hate all of them.
The best place to hide something is in plain sight.
Let me introduce you to the rest of the team.
I couldn't stop myself.
We're not safe.
Your family should come before your career.
I got home just before Tom.
I just need a little time.
Did you hear that?
She has just finished washing dishes.
All you have to do is talk.
How does he do this?
We're not related.
Can you do it faster?
Stuff happens.
I want to be here with you.
We often watch TV while we're eating breakfast.
What if we should fail?
I messed up.
She won't give up easily.
Don't try anything funny.
I saw something.
Do you eat three square meals a day?
They should have arrived home by now.
I can do it without your help.
He wanted to teach English at school.
Tom and Mary have very different opinions.
Did you study French yesterday?
I love to spend time trying to put together a puzzle.
He doesn't understand the risks.
That hasn't happened yet.
Tom thinks you're lying.
Tom was there for me when I really needed someone.
My brother became an engineer.
Forget it. It's too risky.
What time is it there now?
He was drunk and angry.
I don't care about my reputation.
You have a decision to make.
It goes both ways.
They took food and clothing.
They come from the same town.
She felt like crying.
That was naive of me.
The house was burned to the ground.
When you love what you do, it shows.
He gave me a penetrating gaze.
Help me hide this money.
Tom is in his office at his desk.
I told you it would work.
The results of the experiment were not as we had hoped.
Do you know when Mozart died?
That's what I like to do.
Mother bakes cookies on Sundays.
That's for me to decide.
Make me happy.
The street was bustling with shoppers.
There must be some misunderstanding between us.
On my way home, I came across an old friend.
I don't know how to describe it.
In bad weather, one can easily catch a cold.
This is the house where I lived as a child.
What are these people doing?
You look nice with your hair short.
He quit.
Is Tom still at school?
He whispered something to her.
Which book is yours?
Tell me if it hurts.
Three men broke out of prison yesterday.
I'm not sitting here.
You can't do this to us.
I want you out of my office.
I'm looking for a job.
I can't disagree with that.
It's not as big a problem as you think.
His hobby is stamp collecting.
Don't you worry about a thing.
What do you have in your bag?
I haven't tried doing it that way.
I saw him scolded by his mother.
It's getting dark.
Something has to be done.
You're not my friend.
What are you going to have?
Reading makes me happy.
Going out in this rain is out of the question.
I will never forget seeing you.
This is useless.
Is this your first trip abroad?
He went by bicycle.
I apologize.
You must be more careful from now on.
Why did Tom do that?
How much do these glasses cost?
I was discouraged.
I want to see your mother.
What's the alternative?
I had to abstain from smoking while I was in the hospital.
I felt ill.
They incited him to commit the crime.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
Every man cannot be a good pianist.
I want to discuss a very important matter with you.
I want you.
We weren't able to do that.
Money opens all doors.
Tom ignored our advice.
We need to do that as soon as we can.
I'll do it.
I disagree.
Tom tried to persuade Mary to drive.
Would that really be so bad?
He suggested that we go for a swim.
Every town in America has a library.
That's all I know right now.
I was trying to find Tom.
Money does not always bring happiness.
I hope they appreciate it.
The word is unfamiliar to me.
Tom could hear the phone ringing.
May I ask what you're working on?
Why do you resist?
I shouldn't have to go to the dentist again for a while.
I don't know what I did wrong.
I'll dream about you.
You had better read your teacher's comments on your compositions one more time.
We weren't prepared for the assault.
If you do this, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
I'd say you did well.
I don't need your charity.
That's too hard.
They started to sell a new type of car in Tokyo.
I had not waited long before the bus came.
Everyone smiled but Tom.
I'd say you did well.
I'll make some coffee.
You should be real proud of yourself.
You can't hold me responsible.
Tom is vulgar.
We all know it.
I'll let you know.
Very fat people waddle when they walk, though few of them realize it.
I promise that you won't be disappointed.
Keep in mind what I tell you.
Is it yours?
I can give it a try.
Go away before they see you here.
I was busy cooking.
Why not join us for lunch?
Don't forget that we have homework.
When your husband finds out, he won't be happy.
Take cover!
Did you call me last night?
I said it as a joke.
I can't go in there.
Did you understand me?
Some of the apples in the box were rotten.
You're very wise.
Would you care for a little wine?
The attempt failed.
If it were not for water, no living things could live.
I'm frantic.
Water is as precious as air.
You'd be perfect for that.
His salary can't keep pace with inflation.
She is writing a letter now.
You can't fool me with a trick like that.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius, doesn't it?
Can we have a talk?
Tom thinks I can do it.
Tom said Mary would come.
They have everything they need.
I thought he might come.
Why are girls so complicated?
Am I the only one that doesn't agree with you?
Don't worry. I told you everything would be OK.
Do you work here?
They'll eat those.
I'm glad you weren't here.
You had better not do that.
Tom blew all his money on a motorcycle.
There were hundreds of birds on the lake.
She had to rely upon her inner strength.
This is pointless.
He never touched wine.
This problem affects us all.
Tom doesn't know why Mary was crying.
Where do they live?
He devoted a lot of time to study.
A world map shows all the countries.
I hate to see you so miserable.
It's genuine.
I've loved you since I first met you.
I would be willing to help you.
What's a porcupine?
I'll be there in a second.
You drink too much coffee.
I do not like the house.
Tom didn't have the courage to disobey Mary.
That boy is running.
There is a bank in front of the station.
Will that be for here or to go?
In Japan a new school year starts in April.
Tom speaks perfect French.
I know that I'm getting old.
A vigilante bypasses the law and takes matters into his own hands.
You're temperamental.
This is no longer for sale.
I've known that all along.
The weather is nice today.
Everybody hates Tom.
He's a tennis player.
Did you find your keys?
Why don't you read it for yourself?
He is a man of faith.
I asked him where I could park my car.
He's interested in many things.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
It was disastrous.
I can't believe I didn't even think of that.
I'm afraid of dying.
I realize it's probably too late.
That kind of thing can happen when you're in a hurry.
He works very hard.
I wasn't present at the meeting.
This is for internal use.
Tom can make anybody laugh.
There was no one home.
Tom put on his slippers.
This table has a smooth surface.
I saw the way Tom was looking at you.
This time, you've gone too far.
I want you to get off my back.
How do you define normal?
I very much don't want to have to do that.
Are you in a hurry?
Where are your credit cards?
They were hungry.
Do you have any small change?
It's a huge mistake.
You won't drown if you learn how to swim.
I said that ages ago.
Is it that obvious?
You were shy.
I thought Tom told you what you had to do.
Tom and I baked three pies this afternoon.
I always enjoy listening to classical music when I have some free time.
It won't be easy.
How long does it take to get to the beach?
She drives an imported car.
Are you sure you're all right?
There was a witness.
Have you been up all night?
I guess I fell asleep.
I don't feel much like laughing.
I'm not blaming you.
Is he a friend of yours?
I owe you nothing.
There's no reason to worry.
I'm short of breath.
I felt like an idiot.
My sister became a college student.
When I was your age, I had a boyfriend.
How much did they give you for your old car?
I don't know anything about what happened.
No one lets me have fun anymore.
It's the sort of work that calls for a high level of concentration.
How come you didn't come to the party?
You're wrong. That's not what I said.
We've looked everywhere, haven't we?
Tips are not accepted.
I think it's dangerous to swim here.
Why do you feel that way?
I like that tie of yours.
Are you proud of yourself?
I thought you might feel the same way.
He's a fast walker.
Hamlet is a play by Shakespeare.
They are running in the park.
How much money do you have?
She went out to buy some food.
I'm early.
I'm sure you're going to like this.
It was fun while it lasted.
Tom doesn't know if Mary will go with him tomorrow or not.
You can stay with us for the night.
I'll have a white wine, please.
These books are my books.
Tom can't give you an answer now.
I felt a little dizzy.
It's a perfect trap.
It's deer season.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Is that so?
Let's discuss it now.
It turned out that the cards were stacked against her from the beginning of the game.
Don't underestimate your opponent.
I've heard rumors about you and Tom.
You don't look pleased to see me.
Nobody equals him in strength.
I missed you so much.
Children need to play.
I held onto the rope for as long as I could, but I finally had to let go.
Compared to Tokyo, London is small.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I've been trying to make an effort to come here more often.
She teased him.
Let's take a walk.
Come back.
If you really don't want to come, you don't have to.
My back aches.
All the guys were laughing.
Tom drank a glass of water.
I am determined to be a scientist.
I'm smarter than you.
Tom didn't seem surprised to see Mary at the concert.
I will have it uploaded by Friday.
Pick out the shirt that you like best.
I am much obliged to you for your help.
I could not refuse.
Who are you and why are you here?
I know what you were doing.
I don't even want to hazard a guess.
If I'd known the truth, I'd have told you.
The sea was as smooth as glass.
It was Tom who told me you were sick.
We always have to obey the rules.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I said I was busy.
They forced her to confess.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
Is your name on the list?
That is how he always treats me.
The train was thirty minutes late.
I'd like to check your blood pressure.
Nobody will know.
No one seems to listen to us anymore.
My sister's getting married.
You're free to go.
There is a limit to everything.
Money won't be a problem.
Don't your neighbors ever complain?
Politicians are good at raising money.
I'm tired of it.
Are you able to swim?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
If you can see your breath when you exhale, you know it's cold.
That's very good news.
Did you hear what Tom said?
May I go home?
You should go on a diet.
I like English better than music.
He's a historian.
No one told me that she had failed.
You are not kind.
It was hot in the room.
You don't have to be tall to play basketball.
My girlfriend is Chinese.
You were supposed to do that yesterday.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Let's get off here.
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
Did someone pay for this?
Bring me another fork, please.
Students should try not to be late.
I knew you'd be here.
I don't speak Catalan.
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.
Is eating cockroaches a bad idea?
She hit him with a hammer.
You can come home.
I do like you.
He is a nice person, to be sure, but not very clever.
What else do you want to do?
Don't try to talk right now.
I couldn't find a cab last night.
I'm thinking of the plan.
I feel kind of nauseous.
I have thirteen names on my list.
Welcome to our home.
I remember seeing you before.
You can't be a lawyer.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
He's a law-abiding citizen.
Is the mouse dead or alive?
He ran across the street, leaving her alone.
Call the police!
We must create a safe environment for our children.
The museum isn't open on Sundays.
Which cap is yours?
I think we forgot someone.
Are you losing weight?
The lamp was suspended from the branch of a tree.
I'm taking this week off.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
I respect those who always do their best.
I understand what you're saying.
Tom and Mary often play cards together.
I figured you'd be impressed.
Had they known what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
No one will survive.
He cleaned it up.
Why are you building a wall here?
Which reminds me, it's been more than 30 years since that incident.
This is the house where he was brought up.
I was dumbstruck.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
In case I am late, you don't have to wait for me.
I had to change the rules.
Look at it.
He had his license taken away because of reckless driving.
I wish you had come with us.
Have you ever failed a class?
She did nothing but cry all day.
Tom, you're probably right.
Tom sealed the room.
He has a video.
The origin of the fire is unknown.
You really annoy me.
I did it out of curiosity.
How's your old lady doing?
Things are looking great.
Are you spending enough time with your kids?
Sit down with me.
It's not the sort of illness that puts your life at risk.
I ran out of gas.
The war had lasted four years.
It's not enough.
I really wish I could be there with you.
I do not sleep well.
You're very open.
I think Mary's skirt's too long.
You look fine.
He used a lot of honey.
Do you think he resembles his father?
I'm just not cut out for this kind of work.
He ran away so he wouldn't be caught.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
That's just what I need right now.
I didn't know tofu was this tasty.
Get out of the car.
You need to fix this.
Where are you going on your honeymoon?
Most experts think a lot of his theory.
My mother didn't mention it.
I feel funny today.
I have something that might interest you.
You should consult a dictionary when you don't know the meaning of a word.
Yoga can improve your posture.
The plane was late due to bad weather.
She would not disclose the secret.
You'll never want what they want.
This is a desk.
Is this bag yours or his?
I'd do anything to protect you.
What is your greatest strength?
He confided in me things he would tell no one else.
I hope you have insurance.
She forgot to mail the letter.
Let's take advantage of the long weekend.
It belongs to me.
I lost my car key.
You're not listening to me.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
Suddenly, it became noisy.
Rabbits are related to beavers and squirrels.
According to the weather forecast, the typhoon is likely to approach the coast.
Tom refused to give up.
I like to be with my classmates.
If it snows tomorrow, I will build a snowman.
We are watching.
Everybody believes it.
I will watch it.
I already said yes.
I'm happy because you're here.
You're old enough to know better.
I had an argument with Tom about the use of marijuana.
I'll call.
During the war, we had to do without sugar.
We need to talk.
Grab as much as you need.
Turn off the light and go to sleep.
They're gone.
You can't put off doing that any longer.
You're very religious, aren't you?
I was speechless.
I think it's time for me to consider going on a diet.
My little sister is kind of lazy.
Hurry or you'll miss the train.
She advised him to give up smoking.
Tom didn't want to kiss Mary.
I think he is a good man.
Let us do our job.
We found a nail stuck in the tire.
I felt cheated.
Would you put out the candles?
We must do it quickly.
Don't you have work today?
How do I get in touch with you?
Tom's birthday was the day before yesterday.
Are you out of your mind?
He ran to the station and caught the train.
I had my licence renewed a week ago.
Where could he be?
Don't take it personal.
Tom and Mary finally decided to get divorced.
This winter has been mild.
My room number is 5.
I don't know that many people here.
I really love you.
Do you listen to the radio at home every day?
What's important isn't which university you've graduated from, but what you learned while you were there.
I'm not as busy as Tom.
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.
My brother was threatened by someone waving a gun.
I never would've shot you.
When I run, I get sweaty.
This photo is the only one in which the entire family can be seen.
I doubt it.
You got shot in the leg.
Did you hear all that?
Why don't you take a seat here?
Your car's on fire.
I have a dictionary.
I don't want a big wedding.
I don't want to rush you, but let's try to catch the next bus.
She has many dogs.
It won't be easy.
This is my question.
It was a wonderful feeling.
You're winning, aren't you?
Everyone saw it.
I rewrote my report.
I don't see a problem doing that.
I gave my old coat to Tom.
You'll never guess what happened to me today.
I'm married.
We should do something about that.
When you're mad, count to ten before speaking.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
Did anybody get hurt?
I just don't want you to have it.
I left my bag on the overhead rack in the train.
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
We don't have a garden.
Why did you come here today?
I don't like the way you look.
They want to know what's going on.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before leaving for America.
You can't stay in here all day.
You're very sophisticated.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
It's easier to make plans than to carry them out.
Sooner or later, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself.
Drivers must observe the traffic rules.
I love all of you.
You were fantastic.
He fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
I asked Mary to dance with me.
Have you ever driven a van?
If you've been drinking, perhaps your spouse can drive you home.
What are the doctor's office hours?
I watched TV this morning.
We have enough money.
It was not clear what she really meant.
No one can say.
Where were they sent?
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
I like that job.
I'm no expert.
That's nonsense.
He became a hobo.
Your smile always makes me happy.
Sorry, we are closed.
Is it getting worse?
They make a great team.
Do you need a hand with your suitcases?
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
I think you panicked.
Neither of my parents went to college.
I want you to follow orders.
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
Which is your suitcase?
Tom has some nosy neighbors.
You shouldn't go to school.
My daughter is to get married in June.
I should've gone there with you.
I'll be whatever you want me to be.
I work as a museum attendant.
I got all tongue-tied when she spoke to me.
We're going out to get something to eat.
I met your friend.
This is a bit too tight around my neck.
I know it's not fair.
Wait in the car.
I've already said yes.
It's not supposed to be this way.
You work here, don't you?
Tom grows all the vegetables he eats.
He is very sensitive to cold.
This is so depressing.
He transferred his office to Osaka.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
I was horrified.
I want to know how this happened and why.
We're finally alone.
Don't go over the speed limit.
Would you mind if I kissed you?
He was almost drowned.
I value their opinions.
You put in too much pepper.
You're too polite.
You've seen what this machine can do.
Will you please explain the meaning of this sentence to me?
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you.
They gave up their plan to climb Mt. Fuji.
I have no idea how it works.
This is going to happen a lot from now on.
Pay attention to what he says.
The building was heavily damaged by fire.
Never mind what happened.
Mary wants kids, but Tom doesn't.
You don't need to go there.
I had no idea you were involved.
The treasure is believed to lie hidden somewhere in the mountain.
I often talk to him on the bus.
Tom made that himself.
It was not my fault.
It's not your fault.
Minorities are despised in many countries.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
The bacteria that are transferred during a kiss help improve your immune system.
Tom is watching golf.
The reason for this is obvious.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
I want you to think about this.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
I think you owe me some money.
I can't tell you how much this means to me.
I'll eat something once I've finished.
Can I come in?
I'm done with all that.
Excuse me, but would you please tell me the way to the post office?
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
My daughter will come of age next year.
I'm really angry right now.
It's time you went to the barber's.
We should call the police.
He is a poet.
Today I don't want to hear any complaints.
The lady is over eighty.
You've got to be bold!
Don't be so impatient.
You look younger.
You never cease to surprise me.
What language do they speak in your country?
He loves soccer.
You're all fired.
I felt embarrassed at first.
Half the students were absent.
The rumor was baseless.
You should make sure of it before you go.
Go to your respective seats.
Any student can answer that question.
It'll be a difficult decision.
I can't go with you tonight.
This question has often come up.
I'm not here to hurt you.
No one responded.
I like to finish what I start.
I went inside.
I figured I'd find you here.
I want to make this quick.
We are boys.
Tom can play the guitar, I think.
When did you first meet him?
The plane was delayed for two hours on account of the bad weather.
It's a fad.
She was advised by him to go abroad while she was still young.
That's why I'm giving it to you.
I have to go home.
My body itches all over.
There's something I think you need to know.
What is your address?
I'll teach you what you need to know.
You can rely on me.
All humans on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.
Our city is rather small in comparison with Tokyo.
It won't be that hard.
I'll set the alarm for seven o'clock.
I appreciate the effort.
I'll be careful.
He's not always happy.
You're very astute.
Where are you bound?
I insist that we do this now.
I plan to go to her cocktail party.
This hut is a very special place.
This armchair is comfortable.
She needs him more than he needs her.
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that.
If you hurry, you will catch up with him.
I found it necessary to ask for help.
It seems to me that she has a tendency to exaggerate.
Would you like to go fishing next weekend?
I live somewhere else now.
I always thought that a stroke was one of nature's ways to tell you that it's time to die.
Tom is going to learn how to do that sooner or later.
I think we're going to stay for another day.
I have a permit for this gun.
You must read this book.
Do you follow?
I am afraid that you will get lost.
Tom is more famous than I am.
You've painted the walls, haven't you?
I've already fed the baby.
I'm quite comfortable in this room.
Tom was in my French class.
I prefer spring to fall.
Did anybody notice this?
Let me check my schedule.
I often play tennis on Sunday.
Be discreet.
He stayed out of public life.
I'm not sure about this.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Mary applied moisturizing cream to her face.
I've never done harm to anyone.
I felt ill.
I managed to get in.
Tom taught me how to play chess.
After the fire, the smell of smoke in the air lasted for days.
You have to stay fit.
She made her mother happy.
Let's say no more about it.
I need to sleep a little.
I plan to get a job as soon as I can.
I was blinded by the light.
I still need to talk to you.
The water is clean.
Why do people dye their hair?
Which CD do you want to listen to?
We suspected him of lying.
I'm from the West Coast.
May I begin?
Did you do what you're accused of doing?
Tom has a pacemaker.
This sentence doesn't make sense.
Why do you want to dress like that?
Are you going to warn Tom?
I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. King.
Are you studying chemistry?
I didn't volunteer.
I have a flexible schedule.
I have to leave now.
We will defeat them.
It's serious.
The orchestra is playing.
I just had the weirdest dream.
Only love can break your heart.
If there's anything urgent, you can get in touch with me.
I think I'll go skiing.
I don't know what I owe you.
How many times a week do you go shopping at a supermarket?
It poured for three days.
You should make sure that you get there on time. Tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late.
He's a journalist.
I'm angry.
May I request a favour of you?
Tom is holding a mug of beer.
He licked his fingers.
Why do you lie?
I want you back.
Yes, I'm a student too.
Where have you been lately?
I have lived here for a long time.
It's like being a kid in a candy store.
Would you like more coffee?
How many of them were there?
Be careful.
Let me know what you want to do.
Are you going to use this?
Did you receive the letter?
It's only ten minutes' walk from here.
I just feel so lost.
I like having plenty to do.
It's easy to get lost.
Tom spoke into the microphone.
As strange as it may sound, what Tom said is true.
I hate the sound of my voice.
He that will steal an egg will steal an ox.
You don't need to flatter your boss.
I awoke on the floor.
I'm happy you two are friends again.
Wake up.
We work in a factory.
Why do you always wear that hat?
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I had to see you again.
I as well as my brother am to blame.
I'll never leave you alone again.
Should you always freeze fresh meat?
The ship is now in the harbor.
Let me reiterate what I've said.
There are too many people here. Let's go somewhere else.
I feel like I'm always in a hurry.
The young man driving the car was drunk.
We've never visited Australia.
You're not dying.
He fell from the tree.
I can't decide whether to do that or not.
He asked her where her mother was.
It's possible, isn't it?
Why don't you read it for yourself?
I didn't see you until now.
I failed the written test.
I'm sorry, we're completely sold out.
I'm not so sure I want to study French.
This is a wig.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to say something like that.
We've been spotted.
It was convenient.
There's something I have to tell you.
A girl drowned in the pond yesterday.
Tom snores.
Is it true that you gamble?
I wish you could be a little quieter.
No one knows what to say.

She started crying.
Tom read the letter.
Have you ever eaten turkey?
I like your beard.
Tell me who did this.
It's not always like this.
You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?
Are you serious?
Stay out of my way.
I heard you the first time.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
You can't trust anyone.
I know I'm in trouble now.
I think you're wrong.
Can you tell me about it?
Don't leave them alone.
This book contains many pictures.
I really like seafood.
They did not have good equipment.
I'm very happy to be here.
Tom is a very good friend.
I can't believe you turned down that job.

I should've known it was a scam.
Give me something to write with.
Tom can't hurt you anymore.
You're right about that.
Do you know where they come from?
She bought a tea set.
This is justified.
Are you sure that it was Tom?
Are you ready to fly?
You're doing it right.
I'm going to take my car.
I don't see what you're so concerned about.
Would you play with me?
Tom has been offered a job in Australia.
You can say whatever you want to.

It's time to go back home.

This happened prior to receiving your letter.
It was an excellent game.
Do you like it?
I want a lot more.
I felt responsible.
The house where I live belongs to my parents.
May I have a glass of beer, please?
Tom isn't going to let you do that.
I've been drinking too much coffee.
I'm getting the hang of this new machine.
How is your family name written?
Are you religious?
You ruined everything.
Who took care of you?
He's in danger.
Well, aren't you glad to see me?
I don't know how to address you.
Read this.

I can't complain.
I apologize for all the spelling errors.
I don't think I want to study French with you.
There've been times when doing that has caused us problems.

What do you like to eat for lunch?
What happened last night?
I want you to wear this one.
How much does she need?
I don't know if Tom still lives in Boston.
Were you able to sit down?
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
We want Tom.
The Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in 1957.
Do you understand what the problem is?
Where did you go?
It wasn't very fun.

I don't feel like partying.
Tom doesn't know who Mary is planning on doing that with.
I slept very well.
I'm just a little dizzy.
She is blackmailing him.
His name is known throughout this country.
I don't know what to depend on.
Tom certainly had something to say.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I shouldn't have stayed up all night.
There was a bridge across each river.
They're looking for you.
We have little time to waste.
I'm tired of dealing with this problem.
Tom isn't good at hiding his emotions.
I hear you.
We need rest.
Did you see the show?
The night is dark.
Tom took a cold shower.
The changes are being made as we speak.
Can I rent rackets?
I don't smoke or drink. I just do pills.
Who's the fastest one here?

How was your afternoon?
She felt her knees tremble.
Boys, be ambitious.
They worshiped him as a hero.
Something is going on here.
We're a bit late.
Can I have your phone number?
We danced all night long.
Put your pajamas on and go to bed.
I'm content with my current position.
Tom is a friend of mine.
They are great friends.
They do it faster than us.
The situation left him perplexed.
I didn't notice it.
My father is interested in ancient history.
He has taken charge of his father's company.
Who knows what you'll find up in the attic?
You guessed right.
I'll see to it that you get a raise after the first year.
Bring me my cane.
You can't just go.
In case of emergency, call the police.
They said that it was important.
She knit him a sweater for his birthday.

Do you need the phone?
What book did you buy?
It's balmy today.
It won't take so long.
No matter how rich people are, they always want more.
Don't make a decision right now.
He isn't the only one with this opinion.
Bring me the newspaper.
She closed her eyes.
Unfortunately, I can't come tomorrow; I have a meeting.
You can come home.
There are many parks in Boston.
I want a pool.
We'll have to find Tom ourselves.
From the moment he arrived there, he kept on bothering his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home.
I missed you last night.
Tom is your husband's middle name, isn't it?
You don't seem too sure.
He did it for the money.
Tom wants us to come back.
A child is crying somewhere.
I ate the salad.
Is that your own idea?
I will not be able to open the box without breaking it.
I can't describe how I felt.
The fruit is similar to an orange in shape and to a pineapple in taste.
The company's stock price jumped yesterday.
Am I allowed to use this?
I wonder why no one tells the truth.
The weather was ideal.
Tom scares everybody.
He does not like being punished.
I told you not to come here.
You don't have to talk so loud.
Isn't it about time for another beer?
Would you like a drink?
I'll give you a couple examples.

I'll stop gambling.
I know Tom likes reggae.
He cut down that cherry tree.
You're touching me.
We're all ready for that.
We went to the café that I told you about.
It took all day.
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
Anything you say may be used against you.
I'm not talking about that.
She's completely crazy about him.
What country were you born in?
Your time is up.
There are a lot of beautiful roses in our garden.
You should tell Tom what to do.
What's the point of your question?
I can't change what happened yesterday.
Let's talk about it.
I disobeyed you.
I'll tell you exactly what to say.
She bought him a sweater.
I thought the game was over.
Whatever you do, don't pull this rope.
I get a three percent commission on anything I sell.

How's your morning been?
You worry about everything.
He decided not to go.
I don't believe I'm listening to this.
Learn how to drive, you moron.
I'm looking for a wallet.
Blame it on the weather.
She is not a nurse, but a doctor.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I've never seen Tom behave this way before.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
I ate some Greek food at a nearby restaurant just a few days ago.
Let's talk about Australia.
New facts about ancient China have recently come to light.
You're in luck.
Let's watch TV here.
I often hiccup.
I want my life back.
You did a bad job.
How many of you are there now?
Are you done washing your hands?
I don't have the authority to order that.
He found it very hard to keep the conversation going.
Can I see this one?
Get the box.
How's it going?
She grabbed him by the hand and pulled him onto the boat.
I just want to go over this one more time.
Can you loan him some money?
It's unlikely that that movie will make a lot of money.
It's not the job.
Don't be so careless!
On behalf of my classmates, let me say a few words of thanks to you.
He makes a point of doing ten push-ups before going to bed.
It's 99.9% effective.
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
He lives in a small village in Kyushu.
I asked him about the accident.
This sentence is not a translation. It's the original.
What do you have in your bag?
That's what I usually do.
May I eat that orange?
We have to figure out a way to get out of here alive.
It may snow in the evening.
Everybody's a winner.
Be polite, but firm.
If he had gotten her advice, he would have succeeded.
His family circumstances were such that he became a teacher out of necessity.
If he has time, he will come.
Apples grow on trees.
I'm devastated.
Ten divided by five is two.
Let's review the evidence.
What's all the fuss?
It's really fun.
I smell bacon.
Don't eat my french fries.
They did what they were told.
The boy playing the guitar is my brother.
There was only one case of chicken pox at the school.
Mine is better than yours.
You should always spend time doing things that help your children get ahead in life.
I want to look like her.
How did you get here?
I didn't know what it meant.
Your efforts will soon pay off.
The story was in all the papers.
Could you take our picture?
Could you move forward so we can close the door?
As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but sand.
I need a pen and paper.
Tom is utterly obsessed with food. No wonder Mary dumped him!
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
Please turn off the lights when you leave the room.
I won't pretend I'm sorry.
My room is number five.
It's time for you to get up.
She was poor, but she was honest.
You cannot do this.
I'll do that tomorrow if possible.
I know what you are thinking.
It didn't work out.
Let's hope that common sense prevails.
I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Tom tasted the wine.
We need to go.
He was the envy of his friends.
I brought dinner.
I want to find someplace quiet to study.
I think it's Tom's motorcycle.
That's not the problem.
When did you go to work?
I was extremely angry.
I'd like to be woken up tomorrow at 6:30.
He sacrificed his health to fulfill his duty.
Let's live here.
Did you go out?
Tom doesn't know who Mary is going to go to Boston with.
What happened to your other car?
He is fresh from college.
I'm now your boss.
I don't have time to do everything that needs to be done.
Every country has its national flag.
How's your new job going?
We finally have you where we want you.
I hope everything will be fine in the end.
Either you or I will have to go.
Show me how to do this.
So, how did he like it?
We didn't see anybody.
I know how busy you are.
You ought not to have disclosed the secret.
I think that you and I should probably be able to get along better.
She's getting on all right.
They were surprised by what they saw.
I'm going on a trip.
I really don't know.
My uncle was standing there with his arms folded.
You have betrayed us.
I don't remember exactly.
I thought you'd be much fatter.
One lump of sugar, please.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
I advise you to be punctual.
He has white teeth.
I just didn't want you in here.
She married a hotshot lawyer from New York.
What are you complaining about?
I'll teach you what you need to know.
Rice gruel is easy to digest.
What else do you plan to do?
This mobile phone is really expensive.
He no longer works here.
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
I think that actress is one of the most beautiful women on earth.
He has never played golf.
Which shoes are you going to put on?
Tom understands French.
Will you pass me the sugar? "Here you are."
We really want to win.
Let's say that you're right.
Tom knows this is the truth.
A successful business is built on careful financial management.
That really isn't funny.
Put the luggage somewhere.
Are you getting paid for this?
Why would you want to do a thing like that?
They agreed to start early.
I needed a change.
Who's going to pay the bill?
The situation is getting worse and worse day by day.
I thought that things would change.
We are looking for a place to stay.
Elves have pointy ears.
I don't mind.
I didn't want you involved in this.
Will you lend me your bicycle?
We're not mad.
Tom and Mary have broken up. "That's ancient history."
I sell computers.
Buses in the country don't usually come on time.
This isn't a believable story.
We have to sing at an old folks home today.
I was wrong about that.
Would you like some more tea?
He has a strong personality.
Bite your tongue.
I get arrested from time to time.
Is that what you were talking about last night?
We just have to get out of here.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Nowadays many people travel by car.
I don't want you to be upset.
I left you a message at the front desk.
I am going to play soccer tomorrow.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal something like that.
He still hasn't responded to my letter.
Bees make honey.
Please be careful.
Don't get the wrong idea.
Tom began whistling a tune.
How much does this cost?
I was at your wedding.
I plan to study this afternoon after I get home.
That's not exactly what I said.
I observed that his hands were unsteady.
It is imperative for you to act at once.
Tom is likely to be there.
That was great.
They are not tired.
Do you like anchovies?
I have to change.
That wasn't what I had planned to do.
Can you identify this?
He narrowly escaped being run over.
I had problems I had to deal with.
He added to his savings.
I saw them kissing.
What are you going to do tonight?
Who gave you this?
I think they're lying.
I was afraid you'd say that.
All I want is your love.
Let's build something.
Are you having any difficulty breathing?
My brother is holding a camera in his hand.
We depend on each other.
Be careful about what you eat.
I'm 17, too.
Best of luck to you.
Let me grab my bag.
I should've been honest with you.
Please hurry up!
Could you drop me off at the library?
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Give me back my pen.
You seem a little depressed.
Let's chat.
He acts very shy in her presence.
I made that dress by myself.
Three years ago today, Tom and I got married.
It's an outrage.
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Are you happy doing that?
What makes you think we have a secret?
A laptop is better than a desktop.
This is mine, and this is yours.
Put the book back where it was.
It's a very serious question.
Some of them are teachers, and some are engineers.
Stop sucking up to the teacher.
I think Tom would probably disagree with you.
Tom shook my hand.
Ignore Tom.
Iron is harder than gold.
English is a universal language and is used all over the world.
I think he's going to be sick.
We were both in the library.
May I ask a favor of you?
That would be unethical.
Everybody is supposed to wear a tie at the party.
Where do you work?
I sincerely doubt that.
I cannot eat anything today.
She is just a child.
I don't see why Tom wanted me to be here today.
The hotel is run by his uncle.
I didn't know who he was.
I want to live here.
Where did you guys grow up?
Include me in your plans.
You'll find a solution, I'm sure.
Tom has a dog.
This island belonged to France in the 19th century.
He is a sharp-shooter.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
Why are we here today?
We should do this.
You may take this book as long as you keep it clean.
She is always kind to everyone.
He died yesterday.
He can't run very fast.
I passed the examination with difficulty.
He isn't an American.
I don't bite.
Don't let the fire die down.
I'm glad you came today.
Welcome to Boston.
Have you written a book?
Tom suddenly realized he wasn't alone.
What subject do you like best?
Are you on holiday?
Please cut along the dotted line.
It has a flaw.
There wasn't any special hurry.
I see no reason why I shouldn't accept her offer.
The door was locked from within.
My father is out.
The chairman suggested that we should discuss the problem.
Tom is a flight attendant.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't let him kiss her.
What a big boy he is!
He is very careful.
You're arrogant.
Did that accident really happen last year?
Do I have to pay you?
You may use my pen at any time.
Would someone please wake me up at 2:30?
You're never too old to learn.
Whatever you do, don't blink.
She sent me a letter.
Stop bothering me!
I'm not likely to do that again.
I want to know who called.
I'll permit you to go.
The student raised his hand.
That's my wish.
You're always finding fault with me.
That couldn't happen.
Why do we have dreams?
The old man was accompanied by his grandchild.
Compared to you, I'm just a beginner at this game.
Wolves won't usually attack people.
That's what I asked for.
Isn't that what we were supposed to do?
How many cars do you have?
I think it's time for me to confront that problem.
I want to return your money.
I think of you as a friend.
Tom, be careful!
It looks like he might win first prize.
She touched him on the shoulder.
Tom is much smarter than I am.
I'm breaking up with my girlfriend tonight.
No one knew what to do.
Tom seems so nice.
Are you getting tired?
I have to go to the toilet.
Fasten your seat belt.
What's he talking about?
He is proud of being a doctor.
It's been quite a week.
They're similar.
Where is Tom buried?
You look upset.
I have no fever.
Mary dyed her hair blue.
They said it's OK.
Nobody ever laughs at my jokes.
He didn't give me time to think.
Everybody is waiting for you.
Can I do anything?
I ate a salad for lunch.
We can continue playing, as long as we don't make too much noise.
We have a prisoner.
What time do you get up?
Armenian is an Indo-European language.
Tom has a half-sister.
Who makes the best cakes in the city?
I could've helped you out.
Do you have to do this right now?
Why were you there?
He hugged her.
It's made of brass.
You're crafty.
Tom didn't know what else to do.
I don't believe that Tom is guilty.
I'm going to bed now.
The President of the United States is now in Japan.
That's all I needed to know.
I'm so tired.
I don't know what you're talking about.
They asked his older brother to help them do their homework.
Tell me about it!
I don't know what else to tell you.
I want to help you figure this out.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
You're not going, are you?
He was wounded in the fight.
Once you begin, you must continue.
You know very well what I want.
This book is mine. Where is yours?
You're not the only one who feels that way.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
She told him that she was leaving.
It doesn't really matter.
I opened the drawer.
They were responsible for the accident.
We also went to the temple.
I want to see what there is inside.
I want you to tell me what to do.
Tom rushed out of his office.
She is interested in learning new ideas.
Tom found his new job interesting.
You deserve a present.
We had no drinking water.
She wouldn't give him a gift.
I haven't finished that job yet.
Fill this out, please.
His brazen act of defiance almost cost him his life.
How do I get out of this mess?
Tom went into the kitchen to get some coffee.
Are you waiting for someone?
They hated Tom.
The time will come when you will know the truth.
Even though I ate three bowls of cereal for breakfast, I'm still hungry.
Stupid question, stupid answer.
Nothing will stop his going.
She was panting.
Tom will surely agree.
I don't know how to express my thanks.
We had a lot of problems yesterday.
The train stopped.
Were you happy with the results?
All the lights in the building have gone out.
I had some problems to take care of.
I enjoyed this article.
Never mix business with pleasure.
You look busy.
He's kind of cute.
I'm not going to hurt you.
No one goes there anymore.
I need a volunteer.
I really appreciate your coming.
You're very understanding.
Tom is Mary's fiancé.
I leave this afternoon.
This is a dead-end alley.
I always wear an overcoat when its cold.
Don't make me do this.
He denied it immediately.
Will there be any permanent damage?
No one is allowed to go there.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Here is where it all happens.
Milk is a popular beverage.
I really thought I could do it.
Why aren't you at school?
The shooting has stopped.
I think it's impossible for him to solve the problem.
We want to thank you for coming.
Tom asked us several questions.
You are not supposed to smoke here.
May I help you?
I don't know what this symbol stands for.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
Tell me what has become of him.
I need to talk to Tom urgently.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
Tom felt sick.
You understand this, don't you?
Have you ever lived in Boston?
I think that could be arranged.
Choose either of the two T-shirts.
She is Japanese.
Tom is going through puberty.
They're not my friends.
There are many islands in Greece.
Who ate the last cookie?
I don't want to regret anything.
Gas cookers consume half the amount of energy as electric cookers.
Is there much demand for these goods?
Do you have a reservation?
I'd really like to sleep in.
Tom loves to sing.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
She trusts him.
I'm tired of all your fussing.
That's exactly what I'd say.
She traveled around the world.
These containers are airtight.
I'll be there at five p.m.
Let's clean the entire office next Saturday.
I don't have a cellphone.
Glad to see you, Tom.
Did you talk to your new classmates yesterday?
What he needs most is a good job.
We're out of coffee.
I think I've got a touch of fever.
His house is surrounded by trees.
Don't you know his name?
I can't show up looking like I've been working on the farm all day.
That one usually works.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
They are very big.
I love this town.
Please do not try this at home.
I know somebody who speaks French very well.
Do you know my husband?
Tom has a friend in Boston.
My passport's been stolen.
I am not a witch.
I'm kind of happy.
Will you be much longer?
Is it money you need?
Did she show you the picture?
I got terrible grades this term.
This is getting tiresome.
The warranty doesn't cover normal wear and tear.
After I graduated from college, I spent two years traveling around the world.
I've already read it.
Do you have small change?
Her youngest child is five years old.
She lived to be ninety.
You've been warned.
She apologized for having offended him.
I signed the form.
She lives a few blocks away from here.
I'm not your friend.
How much does she spend per month?
Who's taking responsibility for the loss?
Tom forgot to tell Mary what needed to be done.
Say it in French.
I will speak to him alone.
I lost my way in Boston.
I'm not happy with my job.
I said shut up!
We're not eating.
The doctor advised me not to eat too much.
Anyone who criticizes him is asking for trouble.
I have to pay this bill by Monday.
It was planned.
That would certainly make me happy.
We like to talk.
I've missed out on so much.
I can sleep on the sofa.
I'm so happy to meet you.
It's not healthy for you.
I get up at 6 o'clock every morning.
Tom wasn't badly injured.
What a jerk!
He promised that he would never lie again.
You may disagree with me.
I own this place.
I've never spoken to anyone in French.
Spend your time wisely and you'll always have enough of it.
Do I have a fever?
Let's discuss what happened last night.
He's not stronger than me.
Why didn't you tell me?
When was the last time you took the subway?
People were lined up around the block waiting for the theater to open.
Thanks to him, I could get a job.
Tom didn't wear a suit.
Getting your message across is much more important than trying to say it exactly like a native speaker would say it.
I think it's time for me to study.
I would like to kiss you.
Today is colder than yesterday.
Our kids are all tucked in. Now we can kick back and relax.
Tom is just being himself.
As the train pulled out, they waved goodbye to their parents.
When she was three years old, her father died.
Next time I visit San Francisco, I'd like to stay at that hotel.
Can I borrow your laptop?
War is not inevitable.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
My house is on the outskirts of town.
Wait. I want to show you something.
It was wonderful, wasn't it?
The attraction was mutual.
Aren't you done with this?
Tell Tom what you mean.
I'll start.
I like to write songs in French.
Oil and water don't mix.
I go to bed after I study.
You are the tallest of us all.
Be creative.
About how many days will it take to get there?
You're demented.
You're the only person I know who can help me.
Tom had one of his legs amputated.
Tom showed Mary several pictures of his house.
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
I'm tired, but I'll study hard.
Are you still upset about what happened?
How do you write your last name?
I didn't realize you were awake.
I have absolutely nothing to do.
This will be a very dangerous mission.
Was Tom the one who told you where to park?
The Mona Lisa has an enigmatic smile.
Don't believe this.
I wanted to show you this.
He decided neither to advance nor to retreat.
Did Tom kill himself?
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
I'm not doing that today.
Beware of imitations.
You might as well go kill yourself.
I live nearby.
What Tom said didn't make sense.
I made a list.
My mother seldom watches TV at night.
Tom is down in the basement.
I can't settle for this boring life.
I went rock climbing.
Do you want me to tell Tom?
Why don't you start at the beginning?
He was wearing a long black coat that reached almost to his ankles.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Dry the pants on the radiator.
I didn't feel like going.
I just got a call from my office.
Can anyone believe you?
We'll cooperate.
It was understandable.
He had every reason for doing so.
The result was disappointing.
You're ambitious.
I am tired of hearing you moan and groan.
Take a little nap on the couch.
I want you to leave me alone.
Personal liberty is diminishing nowadays.
He kept reading the book.
I'm taking antibiotics.
I see a rose.
I'm going to cook for you.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
I weigh about 60 kilos.
I'm not like you.
What did Tom order?
I'm at home.
That's not the reason why I said the job wasn't easy.
Can you ride a horse?
They were buying time.
Tom's arm must be amputated.
He ran as fast as his legs could carry him.
You saw the pictures, didn't you?
May I use some of this paper?
We hired a company to get rid of the insects under our house.
My parents were proud of me.
Show me a better one.
I can't believe you're eating what the doctor told you not to eat.
What's that your wearing?
He was accused of murder.
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
This is between you and me.
He promised to write every day.
We're going to stay until the end.
There is more water than is needed.
It is man's destiny to suffer.
Tom has a loose tooth.
You must make allowance for his lack of experience.
I got busy.
Tom has been quiet all day.
Chicken pox is a common sickness in children.
The trees will soon be bare.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
Are you still planning to quit your job?
My uncle now lives in comfort.
We need more people like Tom.
What are you writing?
Do you think it's a good idea to feed your dog table scraps?
How are you going to stop Tom?
The doctor advised me to give up smoking.
She whispered something to him.
As far as I know, he won't come.
I have a feeling you and I have a lot in common.
I have no kids.
Tom didn't give me back my money.
We're not going to make it.
I'm busy now and can't go out.
He stopped to smoke.
Tom said that you wanted to go with us.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
I believe love exists.
I don't want to go to the pool.
Tom is complaining to the manager.
Is it something very serious?
Show me the way to the bus stop.
I read his book.
I can jump.
What did you want to show us?
He went to a single-sex school.
Why didn't you come to the party?
Do you have any books in French?
Which museum would you like to visit first?
It has happened before and it will probably happen again.
I walked alone.
She hasn't done her homework yet.
How many men are guarding Tom?
Why are you so angry?
Don't tell me you stole it.
I am alarmed by your irresponsible attitude.
Give me a hug.
Polish girls didn't want Justin Bieber to come to Poland.
I love you more and more each day.
We noticed the man enter her room.
Please send me your latest catalogue.
You're even more naive than I thought.
Tom became very aggressive.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive.
You don't have to lie.
I found a buyer for your house.
Philosophy is often regarded as difficult.
Have you ever played baseball?
His house is somewhere around here.
I couldn't take money from you.
I was in bed all day long yesterday.
Do these paintings appeal to you?
Getting lost is the least of my worries.
You never know for sure.
Yesterday I helped my father.
Don't stop him.
You're the oldest.
Tom caught a big fish.
You didn't have to say yes.
Tom can't do that.
How come you know all this?
I'd rather die.
Do you know how fast you were going?
We found it in the park.
People once believed the world was flat.
There wasn't much traffic.
The landing was perfect.
I have a ten-year-old boy.
Tom could've protected Mary.
He would sit and look at the sea for hours.
I just got your message.
The path was narrow.
I'm not Tom.
Don't waste your money.
We go mountain climbing almost every weekend.
He caught a large trout.
The beach is empty.
You just have to do as you're told.
I wasn't involved.
I'll come and see you one of these days.
Are you afraid of it?
If you invite him, he may come.
For months, he did almost nothing.
Wine helps digest food.
I'll fix your sink for you if you want.
Do your homework right away.
This isn't an easy task.
Are meals included?
Tom didn't sleep all night.
I'm a doctor.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
Don't hesitate to take the opportunity to propose to her.
With the way my luck has be running, it'll probably rain tomorrow.
You are so childish sometimes.
He still loves her.
She got him to eat his vegetables.
Don't forget your sunscreen.
I'll bring my sister to the party.
He is not a politician but a lawyer.
I hate that thing.
Tom writes better than I do.
Turn left.
We can fix this.
Tom swam with the manatees.
They did not listen.
I went there by bus and train.
How can you be so callous?
I thought you were injured.
Have you ever heard of Nessie?
Did you see the news?
I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?
Can you see that small house?
I remember this place.
I'm not giving up yet.
Let's have a chat.
Tom said he hoped he'd be able to help us.
How high can you jump?
I want to know the reason for his absence.
Is that all you have to say to me?
You could've said something.
The suspect is a black male.
I don't think I said that.
French was the language of diplomacy.
I may try again later.
I wish I could speak French.
You need not have come so early.
Let's meet on Tuesday.
Is that why you're upset?
I only hope we're not too late.
Your problem is you're not patient enough.
I can't keep living the way I've been living.
I just want to be left alone for a while.
Have you ever dreamed of me?
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
I like your attitude.
We're asking you not to do that.
Who should look after the elderly?
Who's hungry?
Don't they drive you mad?
She's a smart and independent girl.
They made fun of my clothes.
Smoking is not permitted on the train.
We did our best to help him, but he didn't so much as say thank you.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
She does not speak English as fluently as you.
I'm attaching three files.
He weighs a lot more than before.
How can it be?
Were you looking at her legs?
Which one do you like better?
I just fainted. That's all.
He will be at home tomorrow.
It's a windy day.
They made fun of my clothes.
We'll never forget what you've done for us.
It's probably a good idea.
I often perform in nightclubs.
Do you really think Tom is poor?
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
I forgot my email address.
We were supposed to protect Tom.
She takes piano lessons once a week.
I have a brother.
He got away.
Let's meet again soon.
She will get well soon.
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
How tall you are!
I'll pay the bill.
Let's go in my office.
He has a tendency to be pessimistic.
Tom pointed a finger at Mary.
Solar energy is a new source of energy.
He showed us his mother's picture.
I've known it all along.
I'll raise my hand as a signal.
I didn't say you were crazy.
The speed with which we forget is just unbelievable.
I do want to see you.
Put on a nice dress.
When did Tom say that?
Don't take it personally.
Who's the boy swimming over there?
Tom put his wallet on the table.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Tom looks very sick.
I recovered.
I want my key back.
Can I have a look at your newspaper?
I find that fascinating.
That was very good.
Would you like to come to my party?
Tom didn't suspect a thing.
He plays very well.
A new hotel will be built here next year.
When it comes to marital spats, there's usually two sides to the story.
We invite you to listen to us again.
He acted as a guide while I was staying in Kyoto.
Tom didn't say anything about where he'd come from.
He seems like a respectable businessman, but he's really part of the Mafia.
We got stuck in traffic.
He is not at all a gentleman.
It's October the third.
I have nothing to say to you.
I am in no mood for joking.
I never thought I'd have so much fun.
I'm not gambling anymore.
He gave an angry shake of his head.
She was allowed to go to the disco on condition that she was back by ten.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
I'd like to hire someone who speaks French.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
Last night, I went to bed without brushing my teeth.
I saw a house in the distance.
I stopped smoking.
I have a job for you.
Don't interfere in other people's affairs.
I made her cry.
A crowd gathered around.
Tom's budget contained a lot of guesstimates.
How can you fix it?
I couldn't lie to you.
I'm sorry, that flight is full.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
He quit.
This railing is not as stable as it could be.
Does Australia have four seasons?
At this rate, we'll have to change the schedule.
He stayed in bed because he wasn't feeling well.
They love their kids.
He is an utter stranger to me.
I'll keep it a secret. Don't worry.
I put my suitcase in the trunk.
His words came to mind.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
This isn't over yet.
They addressed me as doctor.
He said he would give me a call, but he hasn't yet.
Is Tom well?
Thanks for stopping by.
I think we'd better do that.
Are you going to a movie?
Where were you yesterday at 2:30?
I haven't read his novel, and my brother hasn't either.
How's the weather out there?
I can't deal with this problem anymore.
Pour yourselves drinks.
I couldn't attend that party because I was sick.
We often hear French being spoken here.
It's too early for you to come.
He doubts that I'll keep my promise.
I called you.
Your garden needs some attention.
I have a serious skin problem.
He will not be back tomorrow.
Please stop playing with your hat.
The faster we rub our hands together, the warmer they get.
You know what they can do, don't you?
Tom is used to staying up all night.
I think I broke his heart.
I just don't want you to get upset.
He's the one who told me about that.
Please use a pencil to write down your name.
I think you're interesting.
Who's going to cook for us?
I went inside.
He did not want her to leave.
I've got to be more careful.
The rumor that they would get married spread at once.
You're resilient.
Tom speaks French better than his classmates.
She asked him how to turn on the machine.
It's a fort built to defend the town from invasion.
She is a student who studies very hard.
I don't like feeling helpless.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
I had to sip the coffee because it was too hot.
I knew we'd find you.
I think he will come to our party.
She cannot play the piano.
Did the dog bark?
It's snowing there.
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
My little brother can read English.
I saw a house with a red roof.
It's up to you to decide whether we'll go there or not.
To learn a foreign language requires a lot of time.
I persuaded him to consult a doctor.
I'm real careful.
I can't help doubting his honesty.
Are you sure that you want to quit your job?
They said you were fired.
Can this wait until next week?
Since I was tired, I went to bed.
What did you do with that car?
No one said anything like that.
Thanks in advance.
They want you dead.
Tom never forgot.
Forget Tom.
They hid themselves in the shadows.
Do you have a lawyer?
There's nothing to be scared of.
He looked very happy.
They're not all busy.
You look really good.
All Tom does nowadays is study.
He carried six boxes at a time.
I found the story interesting.
Do you have a telephone?
It's better to be a winner than a loser.
Let's be honest with each other.
My eyes are burning.
Tell me when to start.
We both love Tom.
Take care not to catch a cold.
Hurry up! I don't have all day.
What am I supposed to do with that?
After I had done my homework, I went to bed.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
Is there anyone who can pronounce this word?
Is this building open to the public?
That's classified.
Am I still your boyfriend?
You're the one who should pay the bill.
Everyone is hoping nothing bad will ever happen in Japan.
The vase that he broke is my aunt's.
It's an excellent wine.
I'm a little angry with you.
Have you had a thorough medical checkup within the last year?
The coach gave me some advice.
I might be a few minutes late.
Will you help me clean the room?
I don't want to sing.
Tom is three years older than I am.
How many times a year do you go skiing?
The tape recorder was on the table.
What did you do at that moment?
Find out where Tom is.
Who's been shot?
The painting is deteriorating.
She has known him since they were very young.
I've been here for a year.
I know Tom did that alone.
Don't take your eyes off Tom.
My mother is always busy.
Don't forget to charge your cell phone.
You may enter now.
I'll only slow you down.
Keep off the grass.
The system isn't flawless.
Why would I know that?
He prefers football to baseball.
Have you been told about the problem?
Did you foresee this?
His oldest son is not married.
They relaxed around the campfire.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
I like to spread honey on my toast in the morning.
Your shirt is inside out.
At first, I thought he was your brother.
Canada has thirteen provinces and territories.
You may have that opportunity.
I didn't know you had a cat.
He was happily married.
That's not how I see it.
It matters little whether he comes late or not.
We opened this store in 2013.
They can't hear you.
Promise me that you'll do that.
Tom took another bite.
Her husband is usually drunk.
Tom doesn't want to talk to you now.
I think we should call the police.
She is my classmate.
Were you drinking?
I can't think straight.
They even named their boy after you.
I have to take the book back to the library today.
You should read this.
The cat is not dead.
Don't be crazy.
I wish there were a more modern translation of this book.
Tom told me he was depressed.
The path is direct.
She made a scene.
That was a close one.
I wonder if anything happened to him.
Everybody is focused.
How am I supposed to dress?
That boy showed no fear.
Tom changed his diet.
Will you let me know when he comes?
If John phones me, please tell him I'll be back by seven o'clock.
I was too small.
I got tickets for the six o'clock show.
Hurry up. The train leaves in ten minutes. We don't want to miss it.
Tom is sitting at his desk.
Can they see me?
Everything is possible.
I have plenty of time to do that.
Trying to find happiness only makes you unhappy.
Do you let your children drink coffee?
In spite of the fact that she was busy, she came to see me.
Could you cancel my reservation?
I just got some good news.
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your classmates.
I want to know how you know that.
Thank you for not blaming me for the accident.
We're here, too.
Tom does nothing but watch TV.
I wish you had told me the truth then.
No one pays attention to Tom.
It is not his business.
Tom said that Mary was disorganized.
I agree with what you said.
I think they like me.
When will your new novel come out?
Can we cut to the chase here?
A stitch in time saves nine.
I've decided to buy the blue car instead of the red one.
Is that normal?
School begins tomorrow.
I often borrow tools from Tom.
I guess I have nothing to lose.
That is not your knife.
Who took care of you?
My favorite sport is baseball.
She looked at a few dresses and picked the most expensive one.
He worked for a rich man.
It was not until I had a baby myself that I knew what mother's love is.
Tom is three years older than you, isn't he?
We're smart.
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
We need to be a little more efficient.
She became happy.
I paid to have this done.
I am very sensitive to the cold.
She's been poisoned.
Do you live in the city?
It was not easy to convince him.
You'll never be alone.
I am sending the invoice by fax.
That's the answer to all my problems.
Don't fish in this river. It's prohibited.
How often do you wash your sheets?
Why did you keep it a secret?
I want to ask you one simple question.
I am loved by my mother.
Drink up your milk.
I think we should look into it.
I'm glad people saw it.
I didn't want to wait for anything.
Tom hasn't won anything yet.
There are almost no gunfights in Japan.
How long did you stay?
Where did you find this wallet?
The coffee was bitter.
You've been kissed, haven't you?
Why wouldn't you listen to his advice?
I'm different.
It seems very interesting.
Are they coming, too?
Tom loved gambling.
He catches colds very easily.
I wanted to speak with you first.
Can you put the baby in the car seat?
All the guests have gone home.
Don't spread yourself too thin.
Tom doesn't know if Mary is dead or alive.
He hid behind the tree.
I don't mind your staying here.
I think you need to see him.
This afternoon the weather is going to get worse.
You broke your arm.
She advised him against doing it.
I had to get away from here.
I don't think she is happy.
Which cat just gave birth?
He was heartbroken.
It's a fine day.
I want this room cleaned.
Consider the successes that have been achieved by tired, discouraged people who decided to give it one more try.
His niece is attractive and mature for her age.
Serving people is his sole purpose in life.
His theory is difficult to understand.
Tokyo is a very big city.
He does speak well.
Have you ever seen a tiger around here?
We found her alive.
I'm not interested in learning how to fix a broken table.
You know the law.
This chair isn't very comfortable.
You should listen to your wife.
I couldn't stop myself.
I returned the books I borrowed from the library, and I borrowed some new ones.
I hope that he will find his way easily.
I like it when it's snowing.
Say which one you would like.
The universe is endless.
Can you say that again?
I'm new here.
Tom is outside.
Would you say it once more?
Why did you stop?
Don't tell me you're tired already.
I see a pattern.
Are you good at cooking?
What's your area of specialization?
The leaves of the trees have turned red.
I've already paid you.
I don't know what you heard about me.
What time did you eat?
I'll be free this evening.
I think that there is a man there.
That kind of thing happens every day.
He knows what he's talking about.
Do we have to do this now?
It doesn't matter.
I was late.
Call me if you need assistance.
Don't let your feelings show.
All living things need oxygen.
I don't agree with this.
He is always friendly to me.
When did you start writing songs?
Why is it that she looks so sad?
Today's meeting has been canceled.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
What makes you think Tom can do this?
Are you sure they can do this?
I think you should change your eating habits.
What've you done?
This is one of the best schools in the country.
No person achieves success or happiness when compelled to do what he naturally dislikes to do.
Can you do it in one day?
I entrusted my wife with the family finances.
We're not barbarians.
Do you think you'll be here tomorrow?
That's all I know.
Tom wired Mary some money.
His bad leg prevented him from winning the race.
No, I didn't go.
What did you do last night?
He seems to be rich now.
How do you come to school?
Have you ever fixed your car by yourself?
Tom threw away all the old newspapers that were in the attic.
You didn't pay.
Tom won't talk to me about it.
We need a bit more time to prepare.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
I do agree with Tom.
I don't know why you need it.
You understand Korean, don't you?
I fell into the pool.
We think too much and feel too little.
I understand what you mean, but I'm not sure how to translate it.
I want you to leave my family alone.
How could you say such a thing?
I'd say you did well.
You're annoying.
I can't do it either.
Tom almost always ignores my advice.
Will you do it?
Are you seriously thinking about getting a divorce?
I have a large family to provide for.
Is it an action movie?
It's boring to stay at home.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
Are you productive?
Are you injured?
I have lunch at noon.
There's no hurry. We have plenty of time.
I didn't take a shower.
You can't do two things at once.
He is old enough to travel alone.
The concert is just about to start.
Please say hello to your parents.
I've already paid you.
We're here, too.
The electricity is off at the moment.
OK, I'm convinced.
I'm not hungry at all.
The wedding will be held in a 17th century church.
What do you think you're doing?
We can't be killed.
My stomach started growling right there in the meeting. It was embarrassing.
I'm playing a TV game.
Tom loves you all.
Why do you want to commit suicide?
Tom is a world-famous writer.
I want to take it apart.
They sweated.
It didn't work.
Tom seldom eats seafood.
You can't do this to me.
People over the age of 18 can drive cars.
I'm still married.
I had a pretty happy childhood.
I can't win.
Three hours is a long time to wait.
I can prove it to you.
You're awesome.
What did you do last Sunday?
I'm rather busy.
I have no privacy.
Let's open the box and see what's inside it.
I don't have a washing machine.
I thought you'd left.
He is clever at making excuses.
What're you all dressed up for?
I appreciate your support.
This ring is very expensive.
I didn't study at all.
I'll make you a new suit.
Tom has braces on his teeth.
That's a very old saying.
I need this more than Tom does.
His success was mostly due to good luck.
Tom made an exception.
He is something of a musician.
She kept her eyes closed.
I'm not a robot.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
We're from here.
I suppose we could walk.
Let's begin, then.
How does that make you feel?
Why are you asking so many questions?
I guess we were happy back then.
Do you see me?
Tom came back an hour later.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
How many people does it take to change a lightbulb?
A permanent costs extra.
The light went on.
China is an emerging market.
I stayed home all day instead of going to work.
I prefer doing it this way.
Be very careful.
It wasn't mine.
All the stories are interesting.
Maybe we should just give up.
We have to attend that meeting whether we like it or not.
The fog was so dense, we could hardly see anything.
Tom ordered a pizza.
In my opinion, you're wrong.
There isn't enough cake for everyone.
Do you know who this car here belongs to?
This is an important point.
Why did Tom leave so suddenly?
I used to look up to him, but not anymore.
It's not going to take long.
Do you have a question?
Are you happy with that?
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
The apple is red.
Can you verify that this message is from Tom?
The young woman was carrying an infant in her arms.
I hope my dream will come true.
That's never happened to us before.
You can't kill us all.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
If you don't like the service, don't leave a tip.
Tom is adorable.
My life is complete.
I wanted to tell you.
A coke, please.
Something did happen, didn't it?
Suit yourself.
This photo was taken in Nara.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Where is the Chinese embassy?
They were naive.
She was almost knocked down by a car.
I would never allow that.
I let you down.
He uses foul language whenever he gets angry.
Don't say another word.
Do you carry a weapon?
I don't know what could've happened.
Do you buy that explanation?
I do want to go with you.
Someone has to pay the bill.
I didn't want Tom to get in trouble.
You never have any doubts, do you?
I thought that he would come.
The value of a good education cannot be measured in terms of money.
Why did you take a cab?
It's a risk we can't afford to take.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.

Who does your decorating?
What's it good for?
What did they say to you?
She didn't like him.
Step aside.
Tom's mother is a very good cook.
I was invited.
He lost his job.
In terms of the pay you will get, is this a good job?
I lost control.
I don't think I've ever done anything that would cause my parents to want to punish me.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I need to go.
I'm blessed.
I've found a good job.
It's unnecessary.
You have to leave everything.
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.
I did OK.
The U.S. Secretary of State is trying to broker a ceasefire between the warring parties.
This newspaper is free.
What's your favorite pastime?
Agriculture consumes a great amount of water.
I wonder if this is love.
Were you able to solve the problem?
I'll make a phone call.
An athlete must keep in good condition.
You've made Tom cry.
What are we supposed to do?
He took a picture of the beautiful landscape.
Tom and Mary weren't able to eat the spicy food that John made for dinner.
I've had a very long day.
I wish I knew what you're looking for.
We found all the boxes empty.
How much is this ring?
I'm not nervous.
Would you move your car, please?
Is everything ready?
He could not go to college.
I hated you at first.
Perhaps I'll write a book.
Don't you think most Japanese students work hard?
It was a gift.
Can you see that small house?
I want one!
I will wait for a week.
I baked some cookies.
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
What's it like?
Let's go!
I should've just shut up.
She could not get over her husband's death.
If you eat that you will die.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I explained it to him.
I knew Tom would help me.
At the sound of my voice, my dog pricked up his ears.
She was anxious about his health.
I risked everything.
I'm uninsured.
Had it not been for your raincoat, I would have been drenched to the skin.
Tom tried his best to look busy.
Your mother loves me.
Don't be upset.
He's totally dependent on his parents.
Where did the bee sting you?
We'll give you a call.
Is eating with chopsticks difficult?
Give me a white piece of paper.
My father may be sleeping.
Don't dwell on your past mistakes!
You said you were going to handle it.
The police were able to verify Tom's alibi.
Tom would've been very proud of you.
Tom was wearing a brown coat.
When the chips are down, the only one you can count on is yourself.
Those children are cheerful.
The job is almost done.
It's a question of principle.
Are you a teacher? "Yes, I am."
She turned off the lights so she could enjoy the moonlight.
I have to talk to you alone.
We had to make the best of a bad deal.
I can't come over tonight.
You're unforgettable.
Isn't it infuriating?
I had a lot of fun last weekend.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
This book is worth reading again and again.
I'll keep my word, whatever may happen.
I figured it out by myself.
There are some books on the desk.
Your team is stronger than ours.
There are thirty names on the list.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
It's a wonder they're still awake.
Don't let anything else distract us.
His old cat is still alive.
Here is your book.
Be careful not to fall.
Father took his place at the head of the table.
When were you born?
What is the book about?
Any comments are welcome.
I agreed with her.
It'll be easy.
Anything you say can be used against you.
I prefer to walk.
How did you come to hear of it?
What's your favorite podcast?
Take care not to catch a cold.
That can be a problem.
Mary received many gifts for her birthday.
It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
I'd like to know the exact exchange rate for yen.
Don't forget to add me in.
Sit down.
I can't take it any longer.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I'm going to be all right.
I thought you liked it here.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
I just feel so helpless.
I require your advice.
She got to the hotel late at night.
We talked.
You are big.
I'll repair it now.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
I'm kind of confused.
He managed to climb the mountain.
Aren't you dressed yet?
I'm not really worried.
I can't just leave you here.
My brother insisted on going there alone.
Tom has changed his mind again.
You are twice as strong as me.
We'll check.
You have a great imagination.
Tom is sadly mistaken.
They live in a house.
The police held back the protesters.
Shops are quiet on weekdays.
Besides the rain, we experienced heavy winds.
Tom said he grew up in Boston.
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
If I were you, I wouldn't do it.
Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
He slipped out the back door.
That's pseudoscience.
I love hanging out with you.
I cut the article out of the magazine.
An honest man would not do such a thing.
Why were you so slow?
You should look up that word.
Have you decided?
They made Tom an offer.
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner.
Her silence surprised me.
He opened the door.
What happened at that intersection?
That distinction was well-deserved.
Is this your bike?
It's going to clear up soon.
It was very quick.
I will have to study tomorrow.
Why do you have to go?
Tom used to be a journalist.
He doesn't like traveling by plane.
Please treat the cat well.
We spent hours looking for it.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
Why is he looking at me?
I went there yesterday.
I'm very glad to see you again.
Could you call me back later?
Have you arrived at a decision yet?
The train is early.
I'll monitor your progress from my computer.
I didn't want you involved in this.
He can't drive.
The dishes are piling up in the sink.
Please leave right away.
It's really bad.
She had lived in Hiroshima until she was ten.
What's your favorite holiday?
Why are you wearing those?
Are you doing anything tomorrow night?
Make the new guy do it.
It's been raining for almost a week.
What's your hobby?
You never know for sure.
Glad to see you again.
Tom will take a look at it.
We must decide by tomorrow morning.
Did that work?
Tom solved the mystery.
Where did you get on this bus?
Electronic components can be cleaned using pure isopropyl alcohol.
Give me a minute.
What is the speed limit here?
Why's Tom always here?
There was nobody there.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
It's in the garage.
I'm thankful for sunshine.
You look gorgeous in that dress.
I need all the luck I can get.
I strongly advise you to use this.
What am I doing here?
Bad news travels fast.
If you don't want to talk about it, that's okay.
Do you remember anything?
Tom forgot his glasses.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.
Tom can't afford a yacht.
Don't walk out on me again.
Who is your favorite author?
Come by later, I have something for you.
Can I sit next to you?
I'm looking for a job that pays well.
We try to go to Boston at least once a year.
Do you have a car?
I'm your friend.
You don't have to explain.
Let's share this money.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
Tom took a cold shower.
I reckon you should do it.
You're very sophisticated.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
I felt relieved.
She did not answer all the questions.
We're being blackmailed.
I made a proposal.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Tom didn't show up for work yesterday.
Don't even joke about that.
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that.
Owls are active at night.
I don't want to tell my parents.
I thought you might be lonely, so I came over with a bottle of wine.
He finally achieved what he set out to do.
Nobody tells the truth.
What time does the first train leave?
My father is in the garden.
You don't work here.
Is eating organic food worth the money?
I hate myself for not having the will power to quit eating junk food.
You'd better relax a bit.
What have you come here for?
How did you come by this painting?
He quit without notice.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
That proposal may be a way to kill two birds with one stone, but we also have to be careful not to get greedy and spoil everything.
Did that work?
Talk to my attorney.
You're joking!
May I suggest another option?
The public demands answers.
He doesn't need to work.
I'm not feeling very hungry right now.
Does this make me look fat?
Hold your breath, please.
I'm contagious.
I'm engaged.
Tom sat behind Mary.
Take a look.
This is an international community.
Follow that car.
I know someone who speaks French well.
I'm not your teacher.
Why are your eyes so big?
Did you have fun last night?
My friends are all married.
Tom gave Mary a heart-shaped cookie.
Can somebody help me?
The leaves on trees have turned red.
How come you don't know this?
We want more food.
Gum got stuck to the bottom of my shoe.
What is all the fuss about?
Did I make the team?
You'll miss the train.
I wasn't entirely sure myself.
Logic is obviously your strong point.
It's hot out here.
Both of them started crying.
This room has air conditioning.
Where was it that you found this key?
She introduced the lady to me.
We tried to cheer him up.
I quit smoking three years ago.
She laid her baby on the bed.
The toilet doesn't flush properly.
Beware of pickpockets.
I don't know if there is time.
There's no need to be rude.
You're in danger.
Give the money to my son.
His wife is our Italian teacher.
I don't have a car.
Where did you buy these cherries?
I don't want to talk about the weather.
How can they just make up stuff like that?
The police used a battering ram to break down the door.
I feel so helpless.
I advised him to come back at once.
I'd say you're jealous.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
She advised him to go there alone.
Tom banged his head on a tree branch.
Tell me the reason why you want to live in the countryside.
She broke the window on purpose.
I didn't think anybody was coming.
He neither smokes nor drinks.
Let me finish, OK?
Do you know something I don't know?
I was worried.
We were busy.
How does it look?
I didn't want to tell Tom about what we did.
My father is too old to work.
These butterflies are rare in our country.
I eat everything.
They smiled.
He'll be back by five o'clock.
It's too bad you can't come with us today.
I'm stronger now.
Tom is as tall as Mary.
What makes you so sure that this won't happen again?
Tom is older than your father.
Is this all of them?
He fumbled with the keys before finding the right one.
He could always tell which direction the wind was blowing.
He is good at singing.
I feel like I could cry.
Tom doesn't laugh very often.
I will go if you go.
Planes are expensive.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Our company's showroom was a hit with the ladies.
I'm sure Tom can win.
That's alright.
There's no need for you to study.
Be merciful.
Is this Tom Jackson's office?
Do you want to sleep on the couch?
Did you see the sunset earlier? It was really beautiful.
I'm looking forward to going hunting with my father.
Could you come back here tomorrow at 2:30?
Who wants another piece of cake?
I dare say he is right.
Let me know when you’re going to leave.
Keep looking.
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
Is this yours?
She isn't kind to him.
I spent most of the day in bed.
I know that Tom can do that today.
He told me about it.
You're not interrupting anything.
She stammers when she feels nervous.
We're not all that stupid.
The wind blew hard.
I'm not in favor of such a plan.
I think nobody's home.
I want my money back.
People believed her to be dead.
Can you use a computer?
I want to watch you dance.
I've seen all your movies.
What do you do for a living?
I appreciate how you feel.
Tom tried to do it, but he couldn't.
Is this your girlfriend?
You should act more calmly.
The weather is terrible today.
Is Tom's name on the list?
I appreciate what you did earlier.
I think we're going to be fine.
I'd like to run a big stock farm.
I don't get the joke.
I don't want to be killed.
Make up your own mind.
I live upstate.
They had their arms around each other.
Let's go by car.
I am from Portugal.
They want you to resign.
This water is delicious.
The fighting lasted about three months.
He was the first to help her.
I love this company.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
I've never voted.
What makes you laugh?
The blockade by Britain and the other allies was very successful.
Add a tiny pinch of salt.
You passed the test.
I go to my father's place twice a year.
I've always wanted to be a mother.
Mary had a girls' night out.
Why am I doing this?
We had a large audience.
Would you like me to repeat the question?
You wanted this, didn't you?
Will you show me your album?
You need help doing that, I think.
I finished first.
There are no dogs bigger than this one.
We're attempting a rescue operation.
Is your suitcase as heavy as it looks?
Wash your hands first.
I see you are ready.
I don't want to be a burden to you.
Tom is on the go day and night.
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
I'd like you to come back next week.
I'm drinking a beer right now.
It's dangerous to swim in this river.
He might retaliate.
Tom might've fooled you, but he won't fool me.
If it had not been for the storm, I would have arrived earlier.
He is sensitive to criticism.
Recently, they have not been giving her her paycheck on time.
Most of my friends are guys.
I think that I'm not academically oriented.
I'd be happy to sing for you.
I came here to learn.
I feel like I've already seen this movie.
You are not a student.
I have something to tell you. I am your brother.
The price of vegetables varies from day to day.
I don't know how I know.
My pet cat died yesterday.
Tom tried to look through the keyhole, but couldn't see anything.
That's totally justified.
If walls could talk, what stories would they tell us?
Is this seat empty?
Tom is still in the bathroom.
It was unbelievable.
I think we need more time.
They walked upstairs.
There's so much to do.
You are crazy.
Were you one of them?
They will help you to get warm.
Delete his name from the list of the applicants.
I didn't want you to miss your bus.
She slowly closed her eyes.
Mail this letter.
Line up by height, please.
I have to pay this bill today.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
You gotta get more organized.
I was tired, but I couldn't sleep.
I know that it is highly unlikely that anyone knows me.
I had some cash stashed away.
A monument was erected in memory of the deceased.
Thanks for your quick answer.
It's no use trying to persuade her.
It was very cold this morning.
We are teachers.
He'd prefer to go on Friday.
It's never too late.
He came out on top.
You're hiding something, aren't you?
I just had a talk with your teacher.
Where have all these people come from?
There's nothing we can't do.
You're rude.
He's in prison.
I'm your partner.
I will go at 10.
Who are you?
You have three choices.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
She gave us lots to eat.
Tom's parents are both murderers.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
He stood at the end of the line.
I was afraid that might happen.
Do you have plans for dinner?
This book is a whodunit.
You're always wearing the same clothes.
You look European.
I'm really looking forward to my birthday party.
Press any key to continue.
The machine is out of order.
He sent me a letter saying that he could not see me.
We should weigh the options carefully before making a decision.
That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?
Don't you move or I'll shoot.
How long did you live there?
Why are you waiting here?
So, are you seeing anyone?
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen.
Do you want me to be happy?
I suppose that's all right.
We rented a canoe.
This bike belongs to my little brother.
What do you usually do on weekends?
Who's here with you?
How many books do you possess?
She is engaged to a rich man.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
We don't have that.
That boy speaks like an adult.
She doesn't speak Japanese at home.
She is dead.
Will you have another slice of pie? "Yes, please."
Tom likes to climb the trees.
I'll be ready in a second.
I'll be back in just a second.
That's why we want you.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
Don't hold it upside down.
She divorced her husband.
I wish I could play the guitar as well as you do.
That sounds outrageous.
Tom should stay where he is.
Did you enjoy your run?
We're just about finished for the day.
I remember seeing you all somewhere.
You're late.
She looked puzzled at the abrupt question posed by a reporter.
I just want to live a normal life.
We didn't find a weapon.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
I was about to suggest the same thing.
I caught the man stealing the money.
Don't blame the messenger.
I think Tom is smarter than that.
I'll be your teacher.
Tom says he's planning to buy a gift for Mary.
They feared you.
Tom didn't have to do this.
I never want to feel like this again.
I think it's time for me to contact her.
Are you dating anyone?
I went to her house, but she was not at home.
His story sounds true.
I think we should stop now.
I still love you.
Things were never the same after that.
You're the one who quit.
I read the whole book in one day.
I stayed there until he had left.
You won everything.
They're sunbathing around the pool.
I think this tie will go great with that shirt.
Tom looked interested.
I never saw you.
You must exercise more care in writing English.
What do you say?
Where is he running now?
Don't you think Tom will be able to do that?
Germany borders on France.
I got scammed.
I've been very busy since this morning.
I thought I'd lost you.
The soldiers had more powerful weapons.
I discouraged him from going swimming since it looked like it was going to rain.
We'll all work together.
I've forgotten your address.
Quite a few people were present at the meeting yesterday.
Call me before you leave.
I like playing with my dog.
We're successful.
I want what you want.
What shall we buy him for his birthday?
I don't even know why we're going.
Don't interrupt.
Do you like school?
Tom takes everything for granted.
I bought a backpack at the army surplus store.
I'm going to make some coffee. Would you like some, too?
I did something I regret doing.
All men have equal rights.
Now I remember.
How did you happen to see them doing it?
His story sounds strange.
Come on, sing with me.
I'm sorry for calling so late. I just wanted to hear your voice.
I hope you found everything you need.
We need an answer.
I don't know if you remember me, but we met a couple of years ago in Boston.
They followed you here.
Not everyone likes that book.
How long do dreams last?
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Let us finish our work.
I don't mind hot weather.
Tom showed Mary my picture.
Stop stalling and do what I told you.
Is everybody ready?
Half of them are students.
I will go if you go.
Can you turn that down?
What country were you born in?
It's the same every year.
I saw a white dog jump over the fence.
He must be over fifty.
The jurors deliberated for three days.
Tell me which you want.
We weren't given a choice.
Tom had a package under his arm.
What are the other men doing?
What do you feed your dog?
I got dizzy.
Can you try?
You don't have any proof.
Please open your bag.
Is your car new?
I think death is preferable to shame.
Bacteria will not breed in alcohol.
I'm afraid I can't make myself understood in French.
You're putting me on.
We're stuck.
We'll be back here next week.
There are thirty students in the beginner's group.
The house is beautiful.
I need to know who I have to give this to.
He let the dog loose in the yard.
Don't worry. Tom won't let us down.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
Mary has a huge doll collection.
I'd like to go to the movies.
You might get something in the mail today.
Will you please let me go now?
We'll never make it.
My father is absent on business.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Keep your head low.
I don't want to be a burden to you.
Something went wrong with my watch.
Do you think it's going to snow tomorrow?
John is two years older than I am.
You shouldn't eat just before going to bed.
I just wanted you to accept me.
Tom is good at playing golf.
The house is well insulated.
They're going to find you.
You're very rude.
It wasn't me who slammed the door.
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
He scrunched down in his seat so that I wouldn't see him.
An investigation is going on.
Men differ from other animals in that they can think and speak.
I am of the opinion that this is the way to do it.
It is difficult for me to skate.
Let's talk about Tom and what he's done.
Did you give him up?
That war ended in 1954.
Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the bus stop?
We're ready for the game.
They said you were fired.
Can we get on with it?
I don't think I could ever do that.
That's the whole problem.
I will always be with you.
Who do you trust?
You look upset.
Our department is understaffed.
Tom knows that I don't like him.
I'm interested.
Take me to your place.
His speech made no sense to me.
If it rains, the game will be called off.
He is a highly paid man.
We may still get lucky.
This isn't money.
Can you walk with your eyes closed?
You're probably too young to understand what is likely to happen next.
I drink coffee every morning.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
On the whole, the Japanese are conservative.
Few people live to be one hundred years old.
We see each other once a month.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Tom doesn't really know how to ski very well.
He said that he was busy then, but that he would be free the next day.
We had lots of fun at the picnic.
Come meet everybody.
I can't understand what she says.
She is gentle.
She looked him straight in the eyes.
We need to go.
It all happened kind of fast.
Are you sure you saw someone on the bridge?
Is Tom safe?
Are you a cop or something?
Do not read while walking.
You may choose any of them.
What did I just tell you?
I'll go with you.
I don't need to be here.
I beg you to stay.
I respect the elderly.
We agree with you.
May I pay by check?
We'll be working.
Tom has been quiet all day.
I'm getting a lot of complaints.
Used car salesmen are a disreputable bunch.
Japanese gardens usually have ponds.
Could you show me how to do that?
Tom doesn't know where Mary usually goes skiing.
Why are you always so aggressive?
She was born in Switzerland.
I don't know how old I am.
I don't have a lot of options.
The candle went out by itself.
He is probably still alive.
I've always wanted to meet you.
You're foolish.
They won't know we're there.
It is not appropriate for you to do this.
Why did Tom call you?
Don't give up without a fight.
Cheers!
I feel much safer now.
The government was obliged to make changes in its foreign policy.
Get dressed.
A person's face tells a great deal about his character.
You said you were going to handle it.
I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.
Tom looked really tired.
He loves you as much as I do.
You're all right.
An olive branch symbolises peace.
We'd make a perfect team.
She is a selfish person.
Did Tom seem busy?
They exchanged greetings.
I cut classes.
All I know is that he came from China.
My father hates the summer heat.
She has snow-white skin.
I returned his book to him.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
I'm quite happy.
What are your pet peeves?
Tom'll cry.
I want to eat some Korean food that isn't hot and spicy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Which one of you wasn't on the bus?
Let's have a drink.
A judge will issue a search warrant only if there is probable cause.
I used to hate doing this.
He not only speaks French, but he speaks Spanish, too.
I speak a little Spanish.
Tom doesn't like mashed potatoes.
She spends a lot of money on shoes.
Cats like playing in the sun.
Once upon a time, there lived a poor man and a rich woman.
I want a kitchen like this.
The accident deprived him of his sight.
I'd rather do this by myself.
Did he touch you?
You should at least wear a tie.
They almost got us.
The auction ends Monday.
Why did they hire you?
You take me for a sucker, don't you?
You don't have to sing.
This song is familiar to us.
You have got to be kidding.
It is difficult to speak three languages.
I was jealous of you.
You never should've done that.
I'm not here.
Shape up or ship out!
She was out when I called.
She raised her hands.
Be a good girl.
Are you in danger?
I stopped drinking coffee.
The work is actually finished.
The whole class is present once a week.
Are you courageous?
The United States of America is a democratic country.
What's wrong with being naked?
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
Let's divide this money between you and me.
Don't you see what's happened?
Why aren't you studying?
You tried to stop Tom from doing that, didn't you?
They're sunbathing around the pool.
They went there.
Can we help you?
They supported his right to speak freely.
This is an effective remedy for crime.
When did you visit your friends?
She went with him to Boston.
Is there anyone in here?
You don't get enough exercise.
I am leaving Japan tomorrow morning.
Tom promised me that he wouldn't tell anyone.
That's a big step.
Can you do it tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you since two o'clock.
It's cloudy today.
I had dinner ready for you.
I never really wanted to learn how to swim.
Tom isn't a student.
You're unbiased.
You're bad.
I've got a date tonight.
He has mutton chops.
We heard something moving in the next room.
You need to stop saying no to Tom.
Tom refused.
It's hard for an old man to change his way of living.
Shut the door, please.
Things are not what they seem.
Don't forget to write the zip code.
He does it faster than you.
Can you give my brother a job?
Do I look like I'm busy?
What'll they do to Tom?
You liked that movie, didn't you?
This is love.
Isn't that what you were hoping for?
How did you become involved in this project?
I exhaled.
Something is missing.
Give these to Tom.
We went camping in August.
My wife is cooking.
You're not ready yet, are you?
Tom kept his opinion to himself.
He kept his promise.
Tom is a good friend of yours, isn't he?
I will never tell a lie from now on.
I catch the flu every year.
Find a solution.
We should hang out.
Tom is angry with us.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Why are they always fighting?
The problem is that we have no money.
What's your favorite sandwich?
We got your message.
I'm yours.
What are your conclusions?
If all goes according to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
This painting is worth a great deal of money.
I'm not a liar.
Memorize it.
I got a bonus.
Do you think you would ever consider suicide?
You don't seem to love me anymore.
He had gone there to help garbage workers strike peacefully for better pay and working conditions.
I think we all should have been more careful.
Hang on just one moment.
You've told me that already.
I'm a real man.
We'll probably be away for a few days.
I like butter better than cheese.
How long have you waited?
They all thought that Tom was crazy.
How did you learn to speak French so well?
Are they dead?
See you tomorrow.
Are you through with the newspaper?
They resolved to work harder.
Are you ready for Christmas?
I feel like a drink.
The photographs are the only proof we have.
Why should I go?
Who do you know in Boston?
My mother cannot drive a car at all.
I studied hard when I was in school.
The roses were from Tom.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
How much is this tie?
She got up at seven in the morning.
Show me some respect.
We both love you.
I can't do this without your help.
Tom didn't answer his phone.
I want to make sure there is enough.
It's convenient to live so close to the train station.
What does that gentleman do for a living?
The murder charge was reduced to manslaughter.
Don't use his real name.
I think Tom believes everything Mary says.
When did you go to work?
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
Come along with us if you like.
Are you quite certain about it?
Nobody is perfect.
Jupiter is a planet.
His health gradually changed for the better after he went to live in the countryside.
I don't think Tom wants to see me.
I did nothing illegal.
Where did you get it?
It was too hard.
Could you please tell me again who your father is?
If everyone pitches in, we can do it.
Do you remember what Tom was wearing yesterday?
May I pay with a credit card?
I think it's worth the risk.
They don't want the truth.
Rather than cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
It was just a passing infatuation.
I was careful to not leave any evidence.
Where are the other three?
Let's take it step by step.
I did say that, but I didn't mean it.
I will give him another chance.
I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, we'd have been friends.
I guess it's possible.
Shut the door tight.
This coffee tastes great.
It was a pleasure working with you folks.
That's why I sent for you.
We've run out of water.
What is your idea?
You might want to have someone look into that matter.
Where did you learn all that?
New Year's cards provide us with the opportunity to hear from friends and relatives.
OK. Go ahead.
I appreciate the support.
I've already paid you.
Some flowers bloom in the spring and other flowers bloom in the fall.
He'll know the secret sooner or later.
What's your opinion on this?
Tom didn't want to testify against Mary.
Everyone's a winner.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I went for a walk early in the morning.
He forgot to lock the door.
I'm not very good at writing songs.
She put on her sweater.
Having a small flashlight in your pocket may come in handy.
What's this song? I've heard it before, but I can't remember the name.
You look sick.
Can you sing us a song?
A whale is a mammal.
I'm unconvinced.
I was afraid I'd never see you again.
I just wanted to talk.
What did he say again?
What do you think now?
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
Who built it?
Half of the apples are rotten.
Those who want to remain may do so.
I couldn't wait to get started.
I think I did well.
Do you remember what you were watching?
Tom's French is almost perfect.
I can't remember the melody to that song.
This is a Japanese doll.
We have a few questions for you.
He is to come here at six o'clock.
They are the ones who want to go.
I want to make it right.
You're a prisoner.
Get there early.
Who's going to be there?
I will take such action as seems necessary.
How many guards were there?
I'm not going outside.
The police eventually arrested Tom.
Tom is a very good salesman.
Am I that predictable?
She's open-minded.
I won't obey those orders.
Choose any dress you like.
I read your letter to my family.
Maybe we should keep looking.
Do you live alone?
Some of the girls laughed.
I see a queen.
I think this is delicious.
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
These are animals.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
I am interested in swimming.
I came from China.
I didn't tell them.
Sometimes the first symptom of cardiovascular disease is death.
The meat is expensive.
He scolded her.
Could I have some more coffee?
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
How often do you shave?
She writes to me once a month.
What are the neighbors doing?
Do you not like them?
Your problems don't concern me.
What are the five senses?
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
At least I'll die happy.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I'm not worried about anything.
Tom seemed distracted.
It all seems so strange.
This tooth is loose.
The fact that I lost my temper made matters still worse.
We left Boston at 2:30 yesterday.
Tom takes his teddy bear with him wherever he goes.
Where's everyone?
They're bringing him in for questioning now.
We still have a few left.
Do you have something for me?
A mere glance is not enough for us to tell one from the other.
This is the book that I told you about.
I want to get married and I want to have kids.
Stop!
She gave it to me.
We saw you.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
It was where Tom said it would be.
I didn't know what to say to him.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
I thought you were smart.
Why do you always seem to want to argue?
I got up very early this morning.
If I'd had the money, I would've bought that.
Somehow or other I found his house.
I don't know if we're going to be able to do that.
Those who don't want to go, don't need to go.
I got fined.
It's about five miles.
Look what I found in the woods.
My cousin isn't the kind of person who'd ever break a promise.
I will come tomorrow without fail.
Stand where you are!
He has no real friends.
Is there any danger of radiation?
How many times have you lied to me?
I've lived here my entire life.
I don't know which of you is crazier.
Make it smaller.
You deserve a present.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
I'm not the only one with a child.
Don't trust him.
She is in a hurry because she is late.
What do you know about this place?
Carry this for me.
I do not feel like doing it.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
Send for a doctor at once.
They'll kill you.
Your life is in danger.
May I drink alcohol?
I'm in love with you, Tom.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
I just got bitten.
He gave his seat to the old man.
Can't they do anything?
She can't be over thirty.
When I was your age, I had a job.
You should not have done it without my permission.
The murder happened between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.
The spinning top skidded across the floor.
I can assure you that you are wrong.
Tom will be delighted to see you.
They have wine.
We just have to do it.
It happened here.
I wasn't very athletic when I was young.
You are free to go out.
I had a lovely night.
You're arrogant.
Help me and I will help you.
You're particular.
I nodded.
I thought he was an American but he turned out to be an Englishman.
None of us will help you.
You seem to know everything.
A true friend would not betray you.
The new birth policy is aimed at achieving zero population growth.
I never realized how awful living all alone could be.
That is not a tiger.
We must escape.
You're not alone.
Where did you buy that shirt?
Tom is really busy, isn't he?
According to the newspaper, it's going to rain today.
After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath.
You're not very funny.
I had to climb over the wall.
If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand.
The river which flows through Paris is the Seine.
It rained nonstop.
Happiness isn't the destination, happiness is the journey.
I really hope things work out for you.
You don't know where it is, do you?
I never spoke.
I'd like to get to know you better.
Evidently, it's going to rain tomorrow.
I tried to cheer him up.
I can barely stand his behavior.
Tom began to suspect something wasn't quite right.
We want justice.
We are doing business with many countries.
Don't worry about your dog. I'll take care of him.
She made it clear that she couldn't make it in time for the meeting.
He has a son and two daughters.
I don't want to tell Tom.
Tom said that he thought Mary could probably do that.
I only eat kosher food.
How's your business going?
I don't know why it's taking so long.
I'm not as happy now.
I could see it was you.
I had trouble doing that.
School begins at half past eight.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
He complains of not having enough time to read.
Why don't you quit?
She despises him.
I'd like to know if they have arrived.
It's not mine.
I think you're cute.
What did the boy say?
You'll be safe.
I could not keep the tears from my eyes.
You're very helpful.
Not all the students were present.
I did that.
Forget him.
I feel sort of dizzy and I feel like throwing up.
She can't swim.
Everyone quieted down.
I need to ask you a silly question.
Tom puts gel in his hair.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
There's no one in your bedroom.
He didn't have a single pen.
I guess I could wait a little bit longer.
I played with my brother.
She has a round face.
I'd like to graduate next spring.
I like your car.
It is fine today.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
She's a supermodel.
Hand me that magazine.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Tom was absent yesterday.
The shirt that I've just bought is very nice.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
I've just arrived. I haven't even unpacked my suitcases yet.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
That's something I like.
It was that dog that bit my hand.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
The job is practically done.
I just assumed you'd be here.
I never thought Tom could do it.
I'm grounded.
Don't worry. There's nothing wrong with you.
It was a resounding success.
I'm used to working all night.
It seems like there's no money left.
We're very different, you and I.
The older we grow, the more forgetful we become.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
He is studying hard so that he can pass the examinations.
How long have you been out of prison?
This watch is a real bargain.
You can trust him. He'll never betray you.
I will give these tickets to whoever wants them.
That is my own affair.
He's smoking more than ever.
I'm not that crazy.
What do you feel most proud of?
I wonder if she will marry him.
I want Tom fired.
He is crazy about jazz.
Tom complained about the high prices.
I did all I could.
What he said was a slight exaggeration.
Is something wrong?
Have you read today's paper?
I wish the fedora would come back in style.
This picture reminds me of when I was a student.
They were standing still with their eyes wide open.
Tom often sings when he's in the shower.
Were you looking at him?
Was that really worth it?
I will have spent all this money in three months.
Do you want me to show you how to do it?
I'll open it.
Defend yourself.
I don't know if I should tell you.
We were able to see the sunset from our window.
You're starting to scare me.
I have three chickens in my house.
I feel dizzy.
Anybody wanna grab something to eat with me?
He is used to eating in a rush.
Why did you turn off the TV?
I'll be there at six.
I don't have anything to read.
Can you make it safe?
He put his tools away after he had finished.
What do you call that?
The coffin was loaded into the hearse.
After a storm comes the calm.
He waited for him until 10.
It will not be long before he recovers from his illness.
Yours is not bad, either.
I struggled.
I didn't flunk.
This racket belongs to me.
She has never gone abroad.
How long have you known about this?
You aren't ready for this.
How did you get into my house?
I warned him of the danger.
I didn't really miss Tom.
This box contains five apples.
She speaks English with a foreign accent.
You need to be careful.
They won't be here long.
I didn't know Tom had died.
You are hopeless.
I want to know where they hid the money.
Tom will be wearing a tie.
He was stunned.
I need to finish reading my book.
I'm glad you're my friend.
I hope you're happy.
We're really married.
We must continue.
I can't remember how much I paid for it.
She advised him to go there alone, but he didn't think that was good advice.
Tom was throwing rocks at my dog.
I can't see what it is from here.
I hope to see you.
I've already written to Tom.
Get out of my bed.
That's why I sent for you.
Why are we poor?
Keep your shoes on.
Tom saw something.
Bring me my cane.
You should have seen it!
People have short memories.
You look surprised.
I was robbed of my wallet by the man sitting next to me.
This chair is too low for me.
I know what to ignore.
I'll tell Tom you called.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
He's attracted to black women.
She looks beautiful in that dress.
He has no more than 1,000 yen.
This medicine must not be placed within the reach of children.
You have a good lawyer.
You're kind of cute.
He had a mad crush on you.
Our fate is in your hands.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
She saw herself in the mirror.
The chances are slim to none that you'll win the lottery.
I think we should follow Tom.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
This should be clear to everyone.
It's still too early to talk about this now.
Do you have a copy?
Did I hear you right?
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
Excuse me.
I do not like this song.
Stop acting like a jerk.
Where are the toilets, please?
They admire each other.
I'd like to go to France.
I'd like some time alone, please.
I never wanted to compete with you.
I hope that your brother is better.
Tom lived the high life until the money ran out.
Nice seeing you!
I want the other one.
I like walking at night.
Even his servants despised him.
I'll take it inside.
You're Tom's students, right?
I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
Would 9 o'clock be all right?
Tom says he's in good shape.
I'd like to talk to you.
He asked for some money.
You're not that old.
Do you like waffles?
How serious is the problem?
The police stepped up their efforts to catch the rapist.
We are responsible for your protection from now on.
I want to drink a cup of tea.
The bridge is being repainted.
How can you tell an Englishman from an American?
It's too late to turn back now.
I know Tom is about to cry.
Have a donut.
Thank you all very much.
I want to know what's going on.
Tom wants Mary to keep him company.
He played a key role in the movement.
The nurse is not here.
We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.
Can a case be made for late-term abortions?
Why did you lock the door?
I still can't believe I'm going to be on your team.
He was kind enough to lend me money.
We're not so sure.
Go kiss someone else.
What were you and Tom talking about?
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
Do you see what I mean?
We don't want them to be uncomfortable.
I want to share this with my grandchildren one day.
It really depends on when.
What foreign languages have you studied?
She went to the museum by taxi.
The cost of living in the United States was rising.
You're not aiming high enough.
She is an efficient and reliable assistant.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
Now eat your supper.
May I have this book?
I'm so bored right now.
My bicycle has a flat.
The kettle is boiling.
Tom hates driving when it's foggy.
Tom is now in danger.
I knew Tom was lying to us.
Tom wouldn't like Boston.
He's washing your car.
She hired him as an interpreter.
This one is a lot easier.
Tom is a preacher.
Let's hope for the best.
Quit bothering me.
It was a false alarm.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Leave us.
I thought Tom wouldn't win.
I'll pray for you.
One word is enough for a wise man.
Knowledge is power.
I am very glad school is over.
Everyone looked puzzled.
Tom wanted to be a writer.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
What's your phone number?
I will get you a bicycle for your birthday.
I got so wasted last night.
Everything's very cheap.
What were you doing, Dad?
This is the house where I was born.
Aren't you going to report it?
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
My opinion differs from hers.
Tom would've been very proud of you.
You don't expect me to face Tom alone, do you?
Where is your father?
All of the students stood up together.
There's something I have to ask you.
I'm sick of your complaints.
I can't remember the combination.
I hope things will change.
We had an unpleasant experience there.
I'm not a doctor, but a teacher.
Tom is talking.
There's a lot of traffic today.
I live in the city.
What a smart guy!
What's the spookiest thing that has ever happened to you?
Nobody believes that anymore.
Call the police!
Tom sat at the kitchen table.
Advances in science don't always benefit humanity.
It's about time.
My father quit drinking.
He's addicted to heroin.
Tom really should've given Mary more time.
There's no answer.
I'm not sure he wants to talk to me.
Tom abandoned his family.
That's a generous offer.
Where are your friends going?
Nice to meet you.
Look here.
Do you watch the news every day?
What sports do you like?
That's stupid.
Get out of here immediately!
This tie goes well with the suit, I guess.
I don't know how to drive a car.
He left Japan at the end of the year.
She advised him to talk about his life in the United States.
Would you please turn on the TV?
Tom wanted me to learn French.
Tom is studying French.
Can I offer you a drink?
They made him work.
You're very generous.
I think you're funny.
In addition to about 30,000 yen, the wallet contained his driver's license.
Tell me again how much money you have.
We must try to protect the environment.
Do your homework before you watch TV.
Don't call me when I'm at the office.
What did you buy?
I don't feel like eating sushi.
I didn't even know Tom had a girlfriend.
You're the reason I came.
All I can do is work in silence.
What would you like to be called?
We both want the same thing.
I think it's time for me to ask for his advice.
I'm very concerned about her illness.
Everything will work out on schedule.
I wasn't born rich.
Be careful!
We tried to cheer him up by taking him out.
I've done the right thing.
You can't give Tom that.
That was a very good try.
Tom doesn't want to eat lunch now.
They handled it well.
The game will be held rain or shine.
You're making a big mistake.
She asked him if he knew where I lived.
I know Tom is sensible.
What should I do in the meantime?
She moved out of her parents' house.
They all cheered.
Are you sure we've never met before?
I could hardly endure the pain.
We share the housework.
We were bored.
I wanted to study French.
I want us to make it happen.
I just can't take it.
I'd like a second opinion.
I want something more.
He plays the piano better than me.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
That's mine.
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
Everyone was screaming.
Tom is much better today than yesterday.
The poor are getting poorer.
Do they have a computer?
Over 300 people were arrested.
Have you considered that?
What did you do this time?
I'm tired now.
You don't sound too sure.
The young adapt to change easily.
I thought you were broke.
I've got nothing more to say.
He is still alive.
She said nothing that would make him angry.
I am so sorry.
I hope your parents like me.
I want you to dance with me.
He was suspended from school for a week for bad conduct.
Everybody liked Tom.
Where did you put the television guide?
Horses are easily spooked.
Don't you want to be in love again?
I'll be waiting out front.
Tom's suicide doesn't change anything.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
Did you get the flowers I sent you?
I hate the weather here.
I can't tell you how angry that makes me.
There's a hole in the bag.
Can you come over and talk?
Can I see you again?
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
An argument may be logically sound without being true.
She is, indeed, a lovely girl.
They live on the 12th floor of this condo.
The sushi at this shop tastes good.
I'm not supposed to help you.
Is it cheaper to call after 9:00?
I have a feeling you might want to see these.
Price isn't an issue.
My hands are stained with paint.
Did you win the case?
Don't touch the computer.
You're tough.
When was the last time you traveled by train?
Did you take it?
I usually wake up at six o'clock.
We live close to the station.
Tom was appointed superintendent.
This won't be easy.
The company asked the bank to loan them some money to buy new machinery.
These books are ours.
Could you get me some cough drops?
I'd never do such a thing.
Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news.
He was too tired to walk any more.
We were concerned.
His hands feel rough.
He has powerful connections in the publishing industry.
I had second thoughts.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
I thought you'd be older.
I see Tom.
I may have to work part time.
When is the intermission?
You seem very busy.
You're spoiling the mood.
The more chocolate you eat, the fatter you'll get.
Why do you want to go out with me?
Someone is coming.
When will you come home?
She was absorbed in the video.
The red lines on the map represent railway lines.
The new tunnel is twice as long as the old one.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
Why did you get so angry?
Don't open it, please.
Many people feel that gold is the most secure investment.
She did her best to help him.
He likes swimming in the summer.
Why does love make us so happy?
My son is going to leave for France next week.
I'll go in.
She advised him to take a long holiday, so he immediately quit work and took a trip around the world.
Tom wore a straw hat.
You should've phoned.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
I figured out what the problem is.
My doctor told me that I needed to lose some weight.
Get off my car.
Who stole the apple?
What do you have in mind?
Did you also invite your friends?
I can't believe I actually said that.
Protesters tried to disrupt the meeting.
Let me pay for your coffee.
I will be more careful.
Are you happy right now?
Tom's prediction was accurate.
Why are you always so aggressive?
Are you being followed?
I got confused.
Can you fix this or should I call a plumber?
You really are something.
We weren't invited to the opening ceremony.
I want you to run to the store for me.
The neighbor's dog is always barking.
She bought a shirt for him.
Believe me, that excuse ain't gonna fly.
What could they possibly want us to do?
You seem busy.
We got up at four in the morning.
They love that song.
That was a nice speech.
Tom called Mary at about 2:30.
I don't have enough.
Get Tom to help you.
You don't have to apologize.
The delegates voted immediately.
You're not as good as you think you are.
Have you been listening to me?
They say that he's still alive.
I don't have any pencils.
His eyes betrayed his fear.
Have you seen my purse?
Let go of the bottle.
I hate that you have to leave.
Are you enjoying yourself?
I was disgusted.
What do you think I was doing?
This is perfectly normal.
One of your neighbors complained.
Don't tell anyone this.
I have enough money to buy it.
I hope I can hold on to my job.
Tom gave Mary a box of chocolates, and then ate all the chocolates himself.
You're not really a millionaire, are you?
He finished his dinner because he didn't like to waste food.
Do you remember the town he was born in?
It's too early to get up.
There's nothing else I want to buy.
It'll soon be time to leave.
I know where to find you.
We only have enough food and water for three days.
I'm ready to make amends.
She complained of the room being too hot.
Do you have a part time job?
Let's never lose hope.
Where did Tom buy it?
We don't want to pressure you.
At first, it is difficult.
Although I grew up on a farm, I don't know much about agriculture.
Where's the pan lid?
I've been given permission to inspect this equipment.
I thought you'd never get here.
Tom blamed Mary for the project's failure.
You have to allow for the boy's age.
They live in a commune.
Get on a horse.
These are completely different opinions.
I don't know how long.
He has not been able to attend school for a week.
She gave me a fake phone number.
He combined two ideas into one.
All I want now is a hot shower and a good night's sleep.
You're always anticipating trouble.
I'd like to live in New York.
Be polite, but firm.
I don't know if I can stay.
She complained to him about the food.
Maybe that's true, but it's irrelevant.
How does that sound to you?

Enjoy your day.

I have the same number of books as he has.

I really wish you hadn't done that.
Just try it out.
The children were fed first.
I'm not miserable.
I never thought I'd say that.
I want to take you to dinner.
This room is empty.
You've been drinking, haven't you?
Just do it.
I'm pretty sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
Is he looking at me?
You said you were going to handle it.

Please stop laughing.

What are you doing?
She achieved her goal.
It's merely a joke.
Be polite to everyone.
You can't stay in here all day.
Tom says that he'll never do that.
This is the last straw.
You must stay.

Hang your coat on the hook.
She is a chatterbox.
Did the storm cause any damage?
My sister is playing with dolls.
There's nothing more I can tell you.
What are you trying to imply?
I have a picture of an airport.
Tom is not a lazy boy. As a matter of fact, he works hard.
I have a bone to pick with you.
He is about thirty.

What do you want to be?
She invited him to her party.
Please be serious.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
I'm embarrassed.

Perhaps the train has been delayed.
I wanted you to understand what you're up against.
This typewriter has been used a lot.

I've been waiting years for this.
There is a Catholic church very near here.
I like this answer.

That's what I'm counting on.
No matter how hard you may try, you won't succeed so easily.
This is depressing.
Our school is on the other side of the station.

There will be a lunar eclipse tomorrow.
The boy pressed his face against the shop window.
I got home first.
Nobody answered the door.
What time did you wake up?
Tom is driving without a license.
I know you feel lonely.
You don't have to speak.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
I wanted to hit him, but he ran away from me.
I guess you didn't quite understand me.
I remember my mother teaching me the alphabet.
Let's do the homework together.
Someone tried to kill me.
You must wait a while.
This is a gift.
I can't force you to do anything.
You have a tendency to talk too fast.
They can't stop you.
I didn't shoot anyone.
Some diseases are caused by a defective gene.
I just wanted to say hello.
We made a lot of noise.
I don't think it's a wolf.
Did you think of that?
I want to talk to you about this report.
Tom lacks empathy for others.
I'm happy for you both.
Would you mind if I drank the rest of the milk?
I think it's not a good idea to let children drink wine.
Bring me something to eat.
She gave him a lot of money.
I'm sure.
You don't have the guts.
It only works on Windows.
Come down here.
You can tell me the truth.
Finding a solution that worked was a process of trial and error.
I wasn't involved.
I never asked for it.
He wants only the best.
I'm very sorry about the mistake.
I don't have your courage.
I'd love to talk to you.
At last, I caught up with my friends.
Tom was first one to leave.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
I did my part.
I continued reading.
What did they hit you with?
I know nothing about it.
Is this enough?
Hey, what are you doing here?
That remains a big problem.
She is hostile to me.
Does he go to school on foot or by bicycle?
Have you heard anything about the organization?
Right now, I feel like talking.
Nobody suspected anything.
What's the problem today?
He didn't agree with us about the matter.
We were late because of the storm.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
I don't want you to leave.
Are you new?
It was a beautiful wedding ceremony.
I know Tom did that well.
We're still not sure.
He was not a good speaker.
The bus will be here in five minutes.
I liked that movie.
After he said it, he was ashamed.
Tom can speak three languages.
I want to speak to a lawyer.
I practiced speaking French with Tom.
I can't give it to you.
Did you feed the dog this morning?
She did not listen.
Nobody knows my country.
I'm not totally convinced of that.
I moved here yesterday.
Tom shrugged.
Do you have my money or not?
You're embarrassing me.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
He is washing a car.
Should I have my tooth extracted?
What do you think I did?
Sales have dropped off at every big department store.
That's illegal.
It went OK.
That was close.
A heavy snow kept us from going to school.
My grandfather likes to walk.
What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?
Don't get me involved in this.
I've dreamed about it since I was a child.
What time is it now?
I want to go back to doing what I was doing before you interrupted me.
Where did he do it?
She refuses to abandon her career for marriage.
Do you have any money?
Where were you born?
I guess we could.
If I were you, I wouldn't buy that.
A few years ago, there was a huge scandal.
Tom doesn't understand French.
How many people are likely to show up?
The girl wearing the blue coat is my daughter.
I don't know how else to explain it.
First of all, I must say this.
They make toys at this factory.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
I'm not so lucky.
I've decided not to quit.
Whose beer is this?
He says he won't come.
I want you to be a bridesmaid.
He is a man you can rely upon.
Tom will always remember you.
I'd like to have a room with a nice view.
You have to go.
Was anyone else injured?
I am trying to learn English.
They say he's very rich.
He lit the candles.
Where do they come from?
We have less than five minutes to evacuate the whole building.
I'll take care of the cat.
What have you done?
He is not what he used to be.
Whenever he comes to this place, he orders the same dish.
You're a very good football player.
If I'd known that Tom was in the hospital, I'd have visited him.
She mistook me for my sister.
Nobody can get along with such a person.
I need to sleep now.
Remain seated, please.
Don't you always do what's expected?
Why don't we take some time to think about it?
They all chuckled.
That wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm blind in the right eye.
I am an only child.
What do you think I've been doing?
Do you have a fishing license?
I'd like you to tell me what happened.
You were there, right?
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
I didn't win.
Let's eat out for a change.
They live in peace.
I'll help you do that.
I thought you wouldn't mind waiting for me.
Let me know what you're up to.
Will you help them?
Finally, I finished a painting.
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you.
Tom is not my friend anymore.
Why are you looking at me?
I was told you were an expert.
You had better prepare for the future.
It may snow in the evening.
Maybe it'll snow.
Don't drink out of my glass.
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
Well, it's worth a try.
Have you ever been married?
I wasn't expecting this.
He is very angry.
What did he want to know about me?
You're very emotional.
You're over-analyzing.
It was a revelation to me.
Do you know how to cook meat?
I agreed to do it.
When does it end?
That key doesn't fit the lock.
Was I wrong?
Don't think about it.
I asked Tom to stay out of it.
Did you write down the number?
I want you to have my land after I die.
You can't quit now.
I talk to myself.
Why would you say that?
As a matter of fact, she is my sister.
The sun sank slowly below the horizon.
Our cat is in the kitchen.
How is your name spelled?
I'm sneaky.
I need you to leave now.
The world's rainforests are currently disappearing.
You shouldn't have done it.
Just tell me this isn't going to get me into trouble.
I felt powerless.
He broke his arm playing soccer.
Could I use your phone?
Tom finally decided to try jumping over the stream.
I almost feel sorry for you.
He was right to give up smoking.
Meat is expensive nowadays.
How did we get into this situation?
Why are you calling Tom?
I'm beginning to feel stupid.
Don't judge people by appearance.
That's not a bad decision.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
Would you like something to eat?
How do you know what's real?
We're hot.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
You shouldn't drink so much coffee late at night.
I don't want to do that without you.
I haven't had a vacation in years.
He is looking for a job.
I just saw a huge owl.
It rains a lot in June in Japan.
Keep your cigarettes dry.
We ought to be ready for whatever comes.
I think that it's going to rain soon.
Let's shake hands and be friends.
The dog is called Spot by the family.
What do you know about him?
This book isn't as heavy as that one.
Tom has been up all night.
I never felt this way before I met you.
He speaks English well.
I don't see the appeal.
What are you crunching on?
She gave him all of her money.
I've studied French for years.
Don't pay attention to her.
I don't know what I owe you.
He solved the difficult problem.
Tom took off his belt.
They needed to trade with them for food.
He can't read it.
I have an idea for a movie.
It was rather difficult for me to make out what he was saying.
I turned to him for advice.
Do it quickly.
There is a windmill on the hill.
We have to do this the right way.
That is the house where he lives.
He's short and fat.
I grew up around here.
Look up the word in the dictionary.
There's a book here.
Did you sleep all right?
Place it wherever you like.
Tom knew where he had put his keys.
It seems that he has something to do with the matter.
It is difficult planning meals for so many people.
We have to find another way to do that.
You should've started without me.
I'd like to get a copy of that report.
The station is three kilometers away from here.
I didn't know.
Don't get mad, promise.
You're very rude.
If there is anything you want, don't hesitate to ask me.
We're contented.
What happens if that happens?
I put it on your desk.
They didn't choose me.
I'm sorry, my father's not here.
At last, we got to the lake.
He cracked up.
It's what we've always dreamed of.
I have a solution.
This dictionary is by far the best.
Tom is playing catch with his son.
We don't have any choice.
I'm sure this can wait.
I don't want you to be hurt.
What I'm telling you is true.
Go away before they see you here.
You should've seen that movie last night.
Take care of yourselves!
Our dog seldom bites.
You don't have to lie.
I must brush up my English.
Bring that here.
I feel very guilty.
He has a good memory.
Tom pushed the raft into the water.
Tom rocks.
How are you connected?
This river runs through my village.
She wrote me a long letter.
Do you understand what's going on?
I never drink at home.
I gave you fair warning.
Well, that could be helpful.
My mother is constantly forgetting people's names.
Would you mind if I went home early?
I can't teach you anything else.
I'm not finished.
Everybody started talking at once.
I'm not denying that.
You're my kid's teacher.
Mary has nobody to talk with, but she doesn't feel lonely.
I do not like science.
Did you come here by train or by bus?
Bring it back when you're done.
Tom comforted Mary.
I'm here if you need anything.
You hate Tom, don't you?
How does he go to school?
I've thought a lot about this.
I've only just come back.
I did not mean to disappoint her.
There's no food left.
You need to save the princess.
Where did you find that dress?
I should've done this sooner.
You'll have to cook more food.
What an extraordinary woman.
He succeeded in spite of all difficulties.
Exercise outdoors.
She expressed her thanks for the present.
I belong to a swimming club.
I am looking for a job near my house.
I've got a sweet tooth.
I had a sandwich for lunch.
Would you like to have lunch together?
We're not open.
My dad is the best dad in the universe.
How about playing golf tomorrow?
I'm used to the noise.
Tom brought the cup to his lips.
I recognized her the moment I saw her.
This region has completely changed.
You need to leave.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
It is life that teaches us, not school.
Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can.
Have you finished reading the book?
I'm afraid I cannot make myself understood in English.
What did she say?
I suppose you want to use my office.
We haven't laid off any employees yet.
Practice makes perfect.
You shouldn't make fun of others.
I didn't eat everything that she served me.
Didn't I tell you not to do that anymore?
As a matter of fact, I do speak French.
I walked along the river.
Why are you scared?
I tried.
I felt excited.
That's the last straw!
Let us out of here.
It will take some time before he understands it.
The ice will crack beneath our weight.
They should've known that this would happen.
They had once helped each other.
We all like you.
We have enough water.
I can't bring myself to do such a thing.
How far are we from the airport?
That bus stops in front of my house.
There was nobody there.
The failure depressed him.
I'm interested in Japanese history.
I don't believe any of this.
Why do people hate Tom so much?
This is a sign.
That door won't open.
What did you eat for lunch today?
We must keep our hands clean.
I have a cat named Cookie.
Can you tell me what this is?
He came home at ten.
One million people lost their lives in the war.
You're not that old.
This reminds me of someone.
Tom brought that.
What a beautiful place!
He's an Englishman.
They say amniotic fluid has roughly the same composition as sea water.
You don't have to respond.
She had her tooth pulled.
I bet I can prove it.
Is it always hot like this?
We had to pay ten thousand yen in addition.
Nobody really cared that Tom didn't help.
The boat capsized.
What are you going to do with that?
You can't be happy all the time.
The last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain.
Anyone can do it as long as they try.
She invited us to her birthday party.
What time is your plane scheduled to take off?
It's a big decision.
I'm going to work on that.
Tom went to school to learn how to tune pianos.
I hope to see it again.
Let me help you put on your coat.
I don't want you to feel alone.
There was a brief silence.
She handed him his jacket.
I guess we're finished.
He worked harder than ever.
Is there a problem?
I usually only eat fruit for breakfast.
Have you finished the work yet?
Who's going to eat all that?
I'm looking forward to seeing your father.
Does anyone have a tissue?
She is good at playing tennis.
Tom is a mystery.
Don't threaten me.
We're not going to be able to call you.
Tom said he knew Mary.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
My whole body was one big bruise after the rugby game.
Don't you think it went great?
These flowers are dying.
I'm sorry about last night.
Please help yourself to the cookies.
I'm sure we can manage that.
If you don't keep the silverware polished, it'll lose its luster.
Your order is ready.
I strongly agree.
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
At what time does your class end?
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
We could tell Tom was scared.
I must renew my passport.
She is on friendly terms with him.
I want you to talk.
This is my father's.
I wanted to get my mind off work.
Tom went to Boston for a week.
I neither drink nor smoke.
In the polls, both parties are on par.
Drivers should be aware of the traffic rules.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel a lot better.
Why don't we go out and get drunk?
You should always do your best.
What do you plan to do?
From time to time, I think about my mother who is no longer living.
He is far from perfect.
He is considered one of the greatest scientists in our country.
All of my brothers died in the war.
Will you tell me?
I have a book in my hand.
Get out of my life!
She has a bicycle.
I use this.
A lot of guys around here hate you.
We were concerned.
It's time to make up your mind.
I reviewed the file.
Tom has nowhere left to go.
I want to talk to you about this report.
It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
It didn't end well.
What did you mean by that?
I thought you might want this back.
I arrived here yesterday.
The point is, why didn't you tell me?
You're a wonderful guy.
We're divorced.
You have three choices.
I want to talk to you about this report.
You're single.
Do you feel like eating?
I promise this will never happen again.
It is an endangered species.
Give that back to me, please.
Why didn't Tom tell us what to do?
Where are Tom's keys?
I'll go first.
What makes this one special?
I hope the police catch whoever did this.
Please come on time.
You told me that you were here yesterday.
He has two cats.
No one is unbeatable.
I'd like to help Tom, but I don't know how.
What would life be without hope?
Tell us what happened to Tom.
I heard voices.
I'm not lying.
If a brain can do it, a computer can do it.
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.
In addition to English, she speaks French fluently.
The hard work paid off.
We're not terrorists.
You should've come a little earlier.
I'm not wearing that stupid costume.
I hear the phone.
He's the laziest person I know.
I caught him cheating on the exam.
Could you call me tonight, please?
Don't think about it too much.
I'm so happy you're here!
These books are mine and those books are his.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever held in my arms.
We were up all night talking.
Many people also considered him a madman.
You must respect your elders.
I think it's sad to not have any friends.
He lied to me.
The drunk driver damaged a tree.
The plot develops rapidly.
It would be a sin to waste it.
Tom doesn't need to do that. Mary will do it.
Who sent you here?
I had my brother put this room in order.
That is where you are wrong.
That's none of your concern.
No one will know.
We're all on the same team.
Many countries have problems with poverty.
Actually, it was quite simple.
Studies say that true happiness comes from giving back, not from material things.
There is one less.
Where are you from?
Would you give me a hand here?
What kind of meal did you eat?
The skin is the largest organ of the body.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
I couldn't stand the cold.
If it happens to rain, the garden party won't be held.
Don't you care?
You're contradicting yourself.
Relax a moment.
Keep driving.
I'm dedicated.
I know that Tom is cold.
Well, tell me what you know.
I'm not that lucky.
Tom had no idea Mary liked him.
What did you hear?
The old man was almost hit by a car.
It's a pity that you can't come.
Why don't you stop worrying and get some sleep?
I hope we didn't wake you.
Once you have made a promise, you should keep it.
I had an inspiration.
It's morning here in my time zone.
I have to do it by myself.
He inherited the business from his father.
I hate to be a nuisance.
Tom was unshaven.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
I called and pretended I was Tom.
They said you were fired.
I wish I could play the guitar as well as you do.
Two men are trying to figure out what's wrong with the car.

She wouldn't let him in.
It snowed all weekend.
Wait until tomorrow morning.

You're preaching to the choir.
I was almost hit by a car.
Commit these words to memory.

That's only the tip of the iceberg.
This is too spicy for me.
I'm unarmed.
We're surrounded.
I need you to go home.
It says on the label to take two tablets.
I'm leaving on Monday.
You're no fun.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I'm afraid not.
I didn't say you were crazy.
It's your turn to wash the dishes.
Smiling sadly, she began to talk.
While we were on holiday, a neighbor took care of our cat.

I don't have any sisters.
I'll shut up now.
You should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.

Maybe I should do it.
He's a married man.

Don't put me in the same class with them.
Say hello to your father for me.
I resent that implication.
I know you don't like me very much.
This product is intended for private use only.
Manuela's dresses are very elegant.
They were all busy.
Are you home?
I know what Tom was doing.
Hardly anyone thinks that we are sisters.
Tom's famous.
I don't think any of us should go.
She called to tell him that she'd be late.
Tom kissed Mary and then went to work.
I miss you. I need to see you. Could I come over?
She disliked him.
Let's get out of the taxi.
Maybe I'm just crazy.
The locals are very hospitable.
I would like to eat there.
How did you become involved in this project?
That jacket is way too big for you.
Aren't you annoyed by that?
Why is everybody shouting?
He doesn't seem to be aware of the conflict between my father and me.
You must not give up hope.
I chopped the onions and put them in a casserole with butter and oil.
I'll be sitting here while he's singing.
I no longer believe it.
It would be better to be blind than to see that.
When did you start writing songs?
It has a flaw.
Tom has been waiting for over three hours.
I don't like paying taxes.
I've always liked baseball.
Would you like some salad?
Nobody's going to hire you.
He soon grows tired of a thing regardless of how much he liked it to begin with.
Tom is already on the bus.
You said it wasn't going to happen.
She believes her son is still alive.
I'm certain that he'll come.
I try to help Tom every chance I get.
Keep it in mind.
I'm glad I don't have your job.
I wrote it.
He was a great poet as well as a doctor.
That was the hardest job of my life.
I appreciate your support.
The museum is not open on Monday.
I have an older brother.
What makes you think that isn't true?
Follow me. I'll show you how to get out of here.
You're safe.
Are you doing anything special for New Year's Eve?
She's very emotional.
Let's try this.
It's a matter of pride.
The door opened and there she was, standing in the doorway.
I'm definitely impressed.
The Seine flows through Paris.
Thermometers often go below zero.
What if something went wrong?
Everyone was there.
Those who want to remain may do so.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
We hope to return next year.
How did you come by all this money?
Tom always makes me laugh.
What's the point in doing that?
Tom knows you're here.
That's an old wives' tale.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
It isn't new.
The children have already gone to school.
We know him.
The bed is very comfortable.
Who are these men?
Can we trust Tom to do that?
My brother likes horror movies.
Will you give it to me?
I should've paid more attention in class.
Please speak in a louder voice.
You aren't superstitious by any chance?
The best hairdressers are gay.
Most souvenir shops are filled with worthless knick-knacks.
I remember reading this novel before.
I'm confused enough as it is.
What did the other guy look like?
I can go next week.
He is nothing more than a coward.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
I can ski.
An accident may happen at any time.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
Would you come here a moment?
I just moved in yesterday.
You must be more careful to avoid making a gross mistake.
Make sure you get a good night's sleep.
Stop crying like a little girl.
God can be found everywhere.
Who's he?
This is your fate.
I did that voluntarily.
In brief, he was wrong.
I think Tom wants to sell us something.
Would you like one?
He sprained his ankle.
I fell into the water.
I ran into a tree.
Why is it so difficult to master French?
The fire that broke out last night was judged to be caused by arson.
Let's ignore that.
Tom is having lunch.
Don't open that door for anybody.
I'd like you to come with us.
That was very good.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
Today was a good day, so I'll sleep soundly tonight.
I'd like to visit Australia someday.
He twisted my arm.
That's a woman's job.
They all objected to his proposal.
I rang the bell.
She looked around her room.
You can't pay someone to sleep for you.
I didn't mean to pry.
It's a polite way of saying no.
I don't care who we give it to.
You are very insensitive.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
I moved back with my parents.
I think Tom is drunk.
I'm the one who brought the subject up.
I love this album.
If Tom had had something to throw, he'd have thrown it.
I saw a stranger enter that house.
We want to hear it.
This will be a good souvenir of my trip around the United States.
I really appreciate you picking me up.
I can't swim at all.
He's bound to notice your mistake.
That can't be legal.
You're not helping.
How are you?
You should stretch properly before exercising.
After eight months, he eventually started dating girls again.
I don't understand what you are saying.
What's the nature of your emergency?
I didn't take anything.
That's my car.
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
I can't believe I just shot myself.
That's what you all say.
He's very ill.
He seems to have missed the point.
A man's body dies, but his soul is immortal.
She is no match for me.
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions.
Am I fat?
I was afraid of getting lost in the dark.
I was really mad at Tom.
None of this is your fault.
The reception was warm.
I know that you can swim.
My computer won't boot up.
She has an advantage over me.
I can't feel anything.
She will be here tonight.
He's had many unhappy experiences.
I just banged my head on something.
I have bad eyesight.
It seems that they're bored of married life.
Can you give me a discount?
My best friend is in Rome now.
He fooled her.
Please speak louder so everybody can hear you.
Please turn down the volume a little bit more.
Have we understood each other?
Is this what you're looking for?
He is making cookies.
I'm thinking of learning Korean next semester.
My computer was down yesterday.
Nobody knows the future.
I stole a gun.
He's an author.
They saved us.
Let's take a breather.
At what age do you want to get married?
The police have few clues to go on in this case.
We still need your help.
Get it out of here.
He looks confused.
My mother faints every time she sees a mouse.
Mary and Alice wore matching outfits.
Is there something in particular that you want to study?
I've finished writing the letter.
I'm not convinced at all.
How dare you say such things about Tom!
They all thought Tom was crazy.
You are trusted by every one of us.
This is his.
Our neighbor has broken a rib.
Let's sit down and discuss it calmly.
The committee consists of five members.
In Japan, we still sometimes see someone use an abacus, but not as often as we used to.
Tom's stoned.
They did a good job.
It was snowing when I woke up.
When was the last explosion?
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
You need help doing that, I think.
What makes you think I'm hiding something?
Don't throw that away.
I won't stay here alone.
He went out for a walk with his dog.
What drives you?
I could eat this for every meal.
I owe my success to you.
I want you to analyze this.
You are no longer welcome here.
We have to talk right now.
The cat played with the toy mouse.
We don't have any sheep.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
You think I'm scared, don't you?
I'll let you know if I find anything interesting.
I wanted to have children.
I almost forgot to do my homework.
Mary wants to become a teacher.
If you do this, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
I don't quite understand what you are saying.
The trouble with you is that you talk too much.
This'll only take a moment.
Have a drink.
As soon as he saw me, he ran away.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
They fled in all directions.
Eat meals slowly.
She is lucky.
Don't just whine, do something!
English is spoken in many countries.
I can't do that.
He didn't want to sell the book.
I had him paint the gate last week.
Are you still interested?
After the hurricane, their house was a wreck.
I can't find anything.
You've never had a girlfriend, have you?
I got caught.
Is there something I can get for you?
A cry arose from the crowd.
She might have met him yesterday.
Don't forget to write to us.
I don't drink anymore.
Who did you speak with?
The drowning man shouted for help.
Can't you ride a bicycle?
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
The cops want you.
They spoke briefly.
They don't deserve my money.
I thought you were my friend.
I wake up at 7 o'clock.
He seldom, if ever, laughs.
I know what you are thinking.
Let me bring you up to speed.
Why are they leaving?
My parents know about it.
We climbed the steep slope.
He is a gentleman among gentlemen.
What does he say in his letter?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't do that.
He tried to persuade her.
Tell Tom I don't have his money.
I have finished.
I'm pregnant.
This job has no future.
Just get to work.
I don't need your praise.
I'd like a shot of tequila.
It's true that he saw a monster.
I feel bad for her.
I like history.
Let's proceed.
We looked at each other.
That might not be a good idea.
He explained to my son why it rains.
I've been impressed with Tom's work.
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?
Two small bottles, please.
Due to the fog, traffic is temporarily suspended.
Don't swear in public.
I can squeeze you in.
Put the rope in the box.
Tom said Mary told him that.
Tom shot at Mary with a crossbow.
Tom lived in Australia in 2013.
That's what smart people do.
I almost forgot my passport.
I am ready to follow you.
The website is down.
He has spent ten years in jail for murder.
Adjust your tie.
He did it without me knowing.
Who are you going to believe?
She spends over a third of her time doing paperwork.
Let me help you with that.
It is imperative that we find another way out of this situation.
I saw it coming.
I swept the floor.
Didn't you read the manual?
When was that?
What's the best sleeping position?
When do you plan to start?
You seem a little nervous.
The bad weather's preventing me from leaving.
I can't allow this.
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
We have to get away from here.
I hear that Mary is very pretty.
My father has a blue and gray tie.
A dog was running.
I think you must be mistaken.
Tom likes his life.
I like English, too.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
I didn't think anyone was home.
We're running out of gas.
It's starting to snow.
I have to earn a living.
My dad was a coach.
Have you read the leading article in today's paper?
I meant it as a joke.
You need to study more.
It's just a matter of time.
You're the only person I know besides me who is actually interested in this kind of thing.
About how many books do you have?
Could we discuss this later?
I've got exactly 13 dollars in my pocket.
I was thinking of getting one.
May I ask a few questions?
If it rains, we will go to the art museum.
Show me where it happened.
Her father became an invalid as a result of a heart attack.
I wish our classroom were air-conditioned.
Don't pay any attention to what people say.
We can't be sure, can we?
How can anyone be so stupid?
He died an unnatural death.
The water is refreshing.
Did I hurt you?
He is afraid of making mistakes.
This road connects Tokyo with Osaka.
We can see his house over there.
It'll take some time to get used to living here.
Who's your friend?
That company hires people without regard to race, religion, or nationality.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
You need to lie down.
It's not what you think.
You are difficult and incorrigible.
Bee stings can be very painful.
Do you have plans for this weekend?
Nobody knows why he turns down my help.
Are you afraid of getting hurt?
Have it your own way.
We'll keep in touch.
You can come along if you want.
Tom always asks for permission before he borrows my bicycle.
I don't think I can do this alone.
I deserved it.
He is something of an artist.
If you want me to help you, all you have to do is ask.
I don't care what you do with your money.
There aren't the shoes I bought last week.
Is that weird?
They want peace.
I'm so happy that you're here!
Do you need a ride?
Leave my stuff alone.
Bring me the flute.
I do not even know what to say to that.
I cried.
Can you call him?
What kind of person would do that kind of thing?
Are you ambitious?
Aren't they adorable?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Is your dog mean?
Don't drink too much coffee.
I can't wait.
Hand over your weapons.
Your father is tall.
She crouched down by the gate.
The mystery of her death was never solved.
I will pick you up around six.
Could you please have a look at this?
You look great in these photos.
The trip will take at least a week.
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
You should not despise a man because he is poor.
I hope you had a good time at the party.
Have you finished breakfast yet?
That's how I planned it.
I've decided that we won't go.
Keep still.
I'm an artist.
I'm a programmer.
Your secret's safe with us.
I need some time to think.
Does he go to school by bus?
She wasn't able to talk to him.
Never tell anyone.
You should have gotten up earlier.
Tom is a window cleaner.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I don't want to wait until tomorrow.
I won't deny that.
He rang the doorbell.
I'm thinking of becoming a nun.
No one is in the bathroom.
I expect him to help me.
They have nothing in common.
I can see much better with these glasses.
Tom was getting agitated.
What do you make of all this?
You're killing me.
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
You weren't there, were you?
Are you here alone?
I'd like to help you.
That work was done very quickly.
Stay right there.
I suddenly saw myself reflected in a window pane and it startled me.
I like it when it's hot.
I'm really not interested in history.
I took that picture a week ago.
I've got news for you, Tom.
You cannot prevent him from drinking.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
He's waiting for you at home.
What's taking so long?
Is this love?
My bicycle was stolen.
There's something I have to do.
It was terrifying.
If God had meant for us to be naked, we'd have been born that way.
I love to go to the movies.
This makes absolutely no sense.
Do you go to church on Christmas Day?
He is not kind to her.
If you're going to apologize, you should do it right away.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
They sailed along the west coast of Africa.
You're very funny.
Stay down!
We ask the teacher questions every day.
He is always late for school.
You should apologize.
It's awfully expensive.
I had a good idea.
Tom won't admit it, but he's secretly in love with Mary.
You're very wise.
Tom leaned over the bridge.
Can he see me?
Why are you imitating me?
He asked if I like Chinese food.
What are you writing?
He showed her the way.
I'm not going out in this weather.
I spent ten dollars on a book.
I don't want you to be upset.
You may go.
What age was she when she first drove a car?
I've always liked soccer.
Why do you care so much?
I'd like to apologize for the way I handled the situation.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
We really had nothing to lose.
It's hard to do that.
I didn't know you were unhappy.
Tom's a beginner, but he catches on fast.
Tom got weak.
You haven't told me your name yet.
If you are hungry, why don't you eat?
We woke up very early in order to see the sunrise.
May I watch TV now?
She is graceful.
Stay in the house.
Don't forget the drinks.
She was very worried about her husband's health.
I want to dedicate this song to him.
Tom has already gone to sleep.
Are you sure it was Tom?
He writes letters to his mother.
You two are really kind.
I would like to thank you for your cooperation.
For a long time, I used to believe the same thing you do.
This is a great book.
I don't believe it.
Someone knocked on the door.
Tom knew nothing about Mary.
Could the situation worsen?
They rushed towards their mother.
You can depend on it.
I got dumped.
I need you to check on something.
I totally believe you.
I really mean it.
Tom and Mary arrived in Boston at the same time.
I think you know that's impossible.
I know Tom will be fair.
In case of emergency, call 119.
I listened to the radio this morning.
We have tried everything.
Our school is larger than theirs.
They'll eat those.
These are my students.
I had a great time tonight.
He has a butler and a cook.
There's something I need to do right now.
All donations are tax deductible.
I hope Tom says no.
I saw the boy in brown shoes.
We need to do this right.
I love to travel.
Our son died during the war.
I don't want to waste your time.
I recommend that restaurant.
Is Tom left-handed or right-handed?
Tom said that he'd wait for Mary until 2:30.
I need an assistant who speaks French.
He did not eat anything yesterday.
I gave you a book.
What'll we do if Tom is late?
I didn't realize it until much later.
He's a little rusty.
I have no idea what Tom said to Mary.
How many times have you been there?
I'm more than happy.
The place is almost deserted.
We had to shut the window because of the mosquitoes.
He gave me all the money he was carrying with him.
I wasn't informed.
There are many more people than I expected.
She asked him where he lived, but he was too smart to tell her.
For a moment, he thought of going after the man.
I told Tom how Mary had been injured.
We heard the door close.
He gave no explanation why he had been absent.
What did you expect?
I can't give you the answer today.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
I know him by sight, but not by name.
Are you going to buy the car?
This is amazing.
Turn on the light, please.
It's for you to decide.
That applies to him too.
Don't be mean.
You don't have to answer.
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
I hope you have insurance.
He got into bed.
I will go, rain or shine.
Our plane was about thirty minutes late.
I'm not sure Tom is ready.
She's the girl of my dreams.
I looked away.
I am out of time.
It's so exciting.
I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
Tom compared a picture taken of Mary three years ago with one that had been taken recently.
Why aren't you listening to me?
You must be a good cook.
My parents caught me smoking.
Things would never be the same.
Would you like that?
Could I see you a minute, please?
Tom knew Mary understood what they needed to do.
We look after him.
You may take the book.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.
Children should be taught not to tell lies.
Is that not clear?
I'm all right.
Tell me it's not true.
What were you doing about this time yesterday?
What's your boyfriend's name?
You have to see it to believe it.
He was lying asleep in the sun.
Tom is going to regret it.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
Daddy, I can't walk any more. Could you give me a piggyback ride?
Is that a possibility?
He went shopping.
I saw him cross the street.
Tom always dresses in black or some other dark color.
They left the movie early.
Please feel free to ask me any question.
These are serious difficulties.
I had difficulty getting a ticket for the concert.
You're the teacher.
Mary is young enough to be your daughter.
Your mother died yesterday.
All my friends are getting married.
Black absorbs light.
I love sunsets.
They're all guilty.
I can't decide what to eat for lunch today.
I didn't want you involved in this.
Don't open the door for anybody.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
I'm so proud of you.
I didn't take your money.
I'll send you a copy of that picture as soon as possible.
Rain prevented us from taking a walk.
My son isn't the only one who enjoys eating her cooking.
You don't have to explain.
Might I ask your name?
The old man spent most of his time looking back on his youth.
We're not ready to do that.
Tom hates you.
You can tear the box open.
I'm as shocked as you are.
Is that a trick question?
Have a good weekend.
Any book will do provided it is interesting.
Does Tom love you? "I think so."
The ATM is out of order.
You have been warned.
We have many purchases to make.
You remind me of a boy I used to know.
The room was empty.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
My feet are cold.
We never go to bed before midnight.
I think we all know the rules.
Do you have a crowbar in your toolbox?
Would you be so kind as to lend me your book?
You need stitches.
You have a lot of work to do.
You are curious, aren't you?
Your birthday is drawing near.
I just want you to be OK.
Drunk driving is a serious problem.
He was about to start.
We have to get to the hospital.
I can't read French, nor can I speak it.
I thought Tom had agreed to do the job.
Tom sat at his desk.
I believe it to be true.
I'll stay here until ten.
We haven't caught the thief yet.
I'd like to help, but I've got an important meeting to attend.
Tom is going to have to stay in the hospital for another three weeks.
Whatever happens, you must keep calm.
He thought the matter over for three days.
I'm going to see what I can do.
He's behaving oddly.
I guess I fell asleep.
You'll be dead someday.
I don't see any bruises.
Where's the phone?
I couldn't hear anything you said.
Do you have some milk?
I know it was you.
Nothing was funny.
I thought you were trying to be funny.
Why don't you slow down a little bit?
The windows are open.
He made an important discovery.
We work every day except Sunday.
Curiosity killed the cat.
It was a test.
Get away from here.
He was caught in an ambush.
I assume you're angry.
She managed to learn how to drive a car.
We're ready to go.
Tom rubbed his forehead.
Let's buy half a watermelon.
Girls are crazy.
He took an oral examination.
Tom thinks that's not a good idea.
We're resilient.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Tom doesn't even know I exist.
I'll be fine.
Look! Two boys are fighting.
When will you come back? "It all depends on the weather."
I had to do this today.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
He secretly showed me her photo.
Do the new neighbors have any kids?
My brother is good at mathematics.
I hope everything went well.
His name is known to everybody in this country.
Medical marijuana is legal in this state.
Light the candle.
Does Tom have to be present?
No one arrived.
Jeans go with everything.
There are students in the library.
Tom couldn't tell what the problem was.
Where are we going tomorrow?
Don't be upset.
This is a DVD.
Are you looking for somebody?
There's one thing that is bothering me.
You never give up hope, do you?
Do you have blankets?
I saw you in the park yesterday.
You're creative.
We're going to need water.
I'm hoarse from yelling so much.
You will be able to play tennis better soon.
Tom was third.
Don't open the door.
Tom eats chocolate every day.
This is why he got angry with you.
All my friends like Tom.
It occurred to me spontaneously.
Just because something is more expensive doesn't mean that it's better.
I don't like your sense of humor.
Is it clear now?
Who does this dictionary belong to?
How's your sister today?
The game will be held even if it rains.
I'm only doing what needs to be done.
Don't be lulled into a false sense of security.
Trying to find happiness only makes you unhappy.
Allow me to accompany you.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.
Her sister is not going to America.
I was hit on the head.
We saw you.
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
We'll meet again someday.
Use this.
Everyone smiles in the same language.
The water is deepest here.
I don't think that that's fair.
Everybody is sore.
He tried to approach her using every possible means.
You are twice as strong as I am.
Is she your sister?
I've never ridden a horse.
Breathe in deeply.
Tom loves you. I know he does.
When I grow up, I want to be a king.
Who has come?
It's not in my contract.
I want to have a job that I love.
They jumped into the water.
Do you have anything to eat?
We're overreacting.
I guess that's OK.
Don't make me leave.
Accidents will happen.
Here or to go?
Who told you the news?
Mother was very busy most of the time.
You look terrific.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Where are my trousers?
I thought you were older than me.
Are you surprised?
Why would you want to do something like that?
It was a pleasure meeting you, Tom.
What is it about?
That's all that happened.
Which is your target?
Tom has a soft spot for Mary.
I thought it was true.
I really should finish this right now.
I don't watch TV.
Tom died from a drug overdose.
I'm going to change my shirt.
Do you play any instruments?
Have you ever gone to Venice?
Patting me on the shoulder, he thanked me for helping him.
I always try to stay optimistic.
I think something may have happened to Tom.
Was Tom in Boston yesterday?
Put it on my bill.
It all depends on Tom.
I didn't think I should drive.
Here's your milk.
They are all very busy.
Did you have a nice summer?
I think this will work.
Do you think Tom is dangerous?
Give me your car keys.
I ruined everything.
It's a very big difference.
Which one will they choose?
He had breakfast all alone.
That's just what you needed.
My heart beats fast each time I see her.
I really need to take a shower.
When I visited my hometown this summer, I found the city different from what it had been ten years ago.
He is one of the American presidential candidates.
None of his students could solve the problem.
I never wanted this.
I'm sorry I shot you.
This house has two bathrooms.
Where is he?
Men are physically stronger than women.
I can't let you do that.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
This is extremely confidential.
Tom saw that movie last summer.
Let me handle this.
The heat is on the administration to come up with a new policy.
He drank straight from the bottle.
It makes sense to pay off your credit card balance every month.
She is busy at present and can't speak to you.
I tried to run fast.
Won't you come to my house next Sunday?
I’ll call you before I leave.
You were there, weren't you?
I'll attend.
It almost worked.
If not now, then when?
Stop crying like a girl.
He isn't any older than I thought.
We are going to have a storm.
This door is locked from the inside.
Tom got rid of his old car.
I don't know how to reach you.
I have three times as many books as him.
Buy me a drink.
We all knew about it.
You don't like chocolate, do you?
Grandma is three and a half times your age.
The same thing happens every year.
Am I really that bad?
The mouse was lured into the trap by a big piece of cheese.
A light rain was falling.
Can you read that?
They cleared the road of snow.
They say we'll have an earthquake one of these days.
Once washed, the lining will look brand new.
I bear no grudge against you.
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
Please make certain your seat belt is fastened.
I rescued you.
Why are they so upset?
We're running out of water.
He solved the problem with ease.
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
Keep an eye on the boys. They're mischievous.
These days few people suffer from tuberculosis.
What are your conditions?
He said that he was going home the following day.
Tom said he didn't want to do that with you.
I don't know which button to push.
He's three years older than her.
Would you like to see my new car?
Those dogs aren't as ferocious as they look.
We saw a jet plane fly across the sky.
Our house was robbed while we were away.
Let's not forget that Tom is only thirteen years old.
Where's my driver?
I'm really happy for you.
I'm finicky.
Mary decided never to see him any more.
I understand you.
The soccer game will be played, even if it rains.
Tom fell flat on the floor.
You always were a good cook.
Take this medicine when you have a cold.
I'm naked.
My dog ate it.
She is her friend.
This is going very well.
I know Tom well.
Tom told us not to swim here.
I'm in love with you.
She told me his name after he had left.
Tell us a joke.
Do you still have feelings for her?
I know this will work.
She is certain to be surprised.
Tom told Mary he'd never lie to her.
How many of these are yours?
I just got your message.
She woke him up.
Tom isn't sure he's ready to perform on stage.
I'm not that drunk.
I want my life back.
Where are they sending us?
Where can I find a hospital?
I suppose I could change a tire if I had to.
Try and do it right this time.
I intended to start at once.
Take a bite.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
Tom loved to do that.
Tom is very good at playing the violin.
You are under oath.
Are you ready to go out?
You make it look easy.
The potato is native to the highlands of Central and South America.
Nobody is here.
The settlers accepted the Indians' help.
In 1978 a peace treaty was concluded between Japan and China.
He's got a boy-next-door look about him.
Where are your books? "They are on the desk."
I just want to rest.
She sat next to him on the bus.
Those people are political allies and will help each other.
I bought it in a thrift store.
Don't say a word to anyone.
Tom may not come to our party tonight.
We need to find what's inside these boxes.
Do you have a flashlight I can borrow?
I'm only three years older than he is.
I have lots of Canadian friends.
This computer runs on batteries.
You're not listening, are you?
We all need to stay together.
Can you give me another pillow?
Why did you come early?
Did you see anybody else in the park that night?
Do you like music?
Tell Tom where he should go.
Will they go on strike again? "I'm afraid so."
I was the only one not invited to the party.
He will come tomorrow.
I don't want people to hate me.
You look young for your age.
After my leg heals, I'll be able to move around again.
I asked him if he knew my name.
He asked me if I were happy.
It really is amazing.
I'm devastated.
I was born prematurely.
Why couldn't I be the one to help you?
I met him in the crowd.
The soldiers were ready to die for their country.
I used to drink a lot of cola, but now I drink only water.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Could you describe to the jury what happened?
Cheers!
I'm happy with that.
We should hang out sometime.
I've taken care of everything.
He nodded to me as he passed.
He's playing with my cat.
Don't give up like that.
Have you met the Jacksons?
Some of the dogs are alive.
I can understand why you don't like Tom.
I suggest you get going.
One person more or less doesn't make much difference.
That was our plan.
I made the wedding cake.
Have you lost weight?
I've finally gotten over my cold.
He told me his life's story.
Is it a social problem?
I tried to save you.
I'd like to see that.
Forget it. It's too risky.
We have enough money.
Take Tom outside.
Tom walked to the parking lot.
I don't want to open the window.
What are you hiding?
I'll allow it.
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
I think it's time for me to leave.
You're a jolly good feller.
The reason is very simple.
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
I thought this present might be from you.
My son likes to play with cars.
Are you ready for the trip?
You don't know how much I love you.
I knew that Tom knew when I wanted to do that.
This grocery store only sells organic food.
How much is that?
No one makes chicken soup like my mother.
Keep this window closed.
This is the guest room.
I thought you'd changed.
Is there any difference between your idea and hers?
What are you up to?
I was in bed by nine.
Look up the word in your dictionary.
You should not go alone.
When did you get your first tattoo?
I approve of your plan.
She feels bad today.
Tom kidnapped Mary.
This smells great! What are you cooking?
I think I'll stay here for a few more minutes.
It's difficult to transplant an old tree.
Thousands of people there were arrested.
I can't put up with him any longer.
This tea is very hot.
It makes no sense.
It's really hot today.
If you were in my place, what would you do?
He is guilty of murder.
Are they brothers?
Your courtesy is appreciated.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
The train leaves in 5 minutes.
Don't be so silly.
You have to pay 10,000 yen extra on holidays.
It'll be invisible.
You're not a teenager yet.
It was just hype.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
Where's the washroom?
You can't help yourself.
Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
What's that?
They all stood up at the same time.
Don't lie. Be honest.
Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.
You're very sophisticated.
I hope you're not alone.
He's a famous popular singer in Japan.
Tom wasn't a bright student.
How old is he?
I didn't have enough money to buy everything you asked me to buy.
They couldn't help us.
I'm pleased with their performance.
I understand that it's not fair.
I never imagined myself going home so early.
That's not what it means.
That's the reality.
Help us.
Please don't forget to mail the letters.
Many parents think there's too much violence on television.
This soup is too spicy.
He can no longer wait.
Tom wants to borrow my car tomorrow.
Why are you acting like my mother?
I am sure of her success.
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
I only eat meat about three or four times a month.
I want you to get in your car.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
Take mine.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
I had two copies of the book.
I refrain from drinking.
Do any of you have anything to say in connection with this?
I buried it.
I am lazy.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
Can you think of any better way to do this?
He is as great a poet as ever lived.
Tom doesn't like scrambled eggs.
This dress looks good on you.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
Please speak more loudly so everybody can hear you.
I think I have a gum infection.
This is my business address.
I just want some souvenirs to remember this place by.
Tom prefers dogs to cats.
What did you write?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Where are they meeting?
What did you expect to happen?
Don't tell me to go home.
Tom isn't used to driving a left-hand drive car.
It is not necessary to bring a gift.
I thought I knew all your secrets.
He flew a kite with his son.
I thought I was alone here.
We have a reservation for six-thirty.
Will you drive me home?
Can they see me?
When do you intend to start?
We couldn't go out because of the snowstorm.
I have a twin.
He went to bed at eleven last night.
Stop badgering me.
The government explicitly declared its intention to lower taxes.
She went to rehab and straightened herself out.
He blames his failure on bad luck.
He is standing on the hill.
Have you ever known them to come on time?
Of us all, Tom was by far the best swimmer.
I was terribly worried.
Tom is a black belt in karate.
The children go to school in the morning.
Now, that's an idea.
His request was equivalent to an order.
Did you stay home to study for the test?
I know everything now.
No one I know wears a tie anymore.
Is it something you can get rid of?
He did all the legwork.
Who was there last night?
Everybody's here.
The use of this type of radio has become widespread.
The king imposed heavy taxes on the people.
People are getting antsy.
It's getting dark.
His story turned out to be false.
He had a problem with the front door key.
That might not be easy.
Trust Tom.
I don't believe in banks.
I think he will object to our plan.
It was chilly that day.
Did you come here alone?
I know Tom was distracted.
This house is abandoned.
Does that suit you?
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
Why don't you talk to me about it?
Why do you say one thing, and then go and do another?
Do you mind if I stay here?
This is my younger sister.
I'm happy, too.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
John and Mary have known each other since 1976.
It's just a formality.
I destroyed everything.
I just wanted to know what time Tom would arrive.
It's not always cold in Boston.
You deserve a prize.
He failed to become a cabinet member at that time.
A good poker player can tell when someone's bluffing.
He slammed his door shut.
What are you learning at school?
Did you watch TV last night?
You're just the person I want to speak to.
You'll never leave this town.
He was proud of his daughter.
I got up late this morning.
French isn't spoken here.
Tom wanted to make more money.
I'll keep your advice in mind.
Honestly, I don't think you have what it takes to become a teacher.
No one is coming with me.
We should do this.
You're totally ignorant.
You look tired.
He will notice sooner or later.
Tom laughed at Mary.
I don't have money, but I have dreams.
You don't have to apologize.
Isn't this simply beautiful?
I highly doubt that.
He speaks two languages besides English.
That's a ridiculous idea.
Now why would you go and do a stupid thing like that?
He hurried to the station.
The truth is that nothing is totally true or false.
I want you to remember this moment.
He went shopping.
He is ready to join us under one condition.
I sell clothing online.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
It's a gross distortion of the truth.
Tom didn't choose the same thing Mary did.
I don't know what to believe.
Let's go back to the motel.
Which do you like better, summer or winter?
Burglars broke into our apartment and stole my wife's fur coat.
He made no reply.
I thought this present might be from you.
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
I don't think I can do that.
You were great.
I don't like this sweater.
We have families we have to take care of.
I did it against my will.
I want you all to myself.
It's very dark in here.
I am well acquainted with the subject.
He's definitely not coming.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
You aren't ready for this.
I didn't tell anyone about it.
Tell Tom to do that later.
I ran ahead to warn everybody.
The stakes are high.
He'll be there in ten minutes.
The police officer put handcuffs on the suspect.
Which is longer, this pen or that one?
I didn't kill anyone.
Always tell the truth.
We can do so much more.
Did you see the accident with your own eyes?
I really don't want to go.
You are very kind to show me the way.
Why don't you put some clothes on?
I don't understand what you are talking about.
I don't like the way you're acting.
You ran a red light.
If the car is gone, he can't be at the office.
He plays the piano better than I do.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
That meal was simply divine.
In recent years, science has made remarkable progress.
Her dream is to become a nurse.
I don't understand at all.
The problem will resolve itself eventually.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Doctors removed the bullet.
Look at that picture.
I guess you'll need some help.
Who likes beans?
I can't go in there.
It is not so difficult as you think.
Behave yourself.
You've done it!
Press this button to start the machine.
The cook put the food in the dumb waiter.
Tom's name is on the envelope.
The election results were extremely close.
He seems to be happy.
They want to kill me.
It hasn't been done before.
Daddy, let's see if you can out-stare me.
Leave me alone!
He got the job by a fluke.
Tom didn't mention any of this to me.
I think we should call Tom.
Tom wants Mary to know he's not planning on asking her to marry him.
You don't have to lie.
I thought you were taller.
Get out of the way.
A sensible man wouldn't say such a thing in public.
I'm not afraid of anyone.
I sure miss my friends.
What's wrong with them?
He crushed the box.
He told me that Poe's novels were interesting.
It's bedtime.
Tom and Mary know the truth.
The light came on suddenly.
I'm not talking to you.
Didn't you know I was from Boston?
I suspect you're right.
Do you want me to show you how to do it?
On hearing the news, she turned pale.
There's no need to hurry.
Nobody will help you.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
The boat sank to the bottom.
Shanghai is referred to as the Paris of the East.
I checked the time on the clock.
We look up to Tom as our leader.
I met her by chance.
I'm willing to apologize.
Our car broke down on our way there.
It's your duty to finish the job.
Your daughter's on drugs.
I dunno if it's a bug or what, but this software doesn't work right.
Nothing has been decided.
I don't know if this is true.
My parent's house is comfortable.
She died.
They moved in just the other day.
Hold on a minute.
What is old age? First you forget names, then you forget faces, then you forget to pull your zipper up, then you forget to pull it down.
I have to start somewhere.
Raspberries are very expensive.
It's worth a try, right?
There were a lot of girls at the party.
I don't feel like dancing.
How long does it take by bus?
Tom didn't need it anymore.
They gave a piece of cake to Tom.
I'm 100% sure of my decision.
It's getting colder and colder.
The prophecy came true.
All I want is for you to be happy.
Why are you speaking in French?
What are you doing out of bed?
Get in the car.
You seem distracted today.
I can't be friends with Tom.
Tom forgot to salute.
I don't regret that decision.
All I have is books.
How long may I borrow this notebook?
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
Marriage is a lottery.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was no question about that.
Tell Tom that I'm angry.
Let me know when you're done.
We won the battle.
Do you eat fish?
He looks suspicious.
What was it that brought you to me?
How do you know they're looking for us?
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
They kept talking all the time.
I live in an apartment.
I have time, so I'll do it.
This is not about money.
Smoke filled the room.
I can't stand getting beaten.
I could fix that easily.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be able to finish the report by 2:30.
Love hurts.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
She has gone abroad.
She explained the matter to me.
This program is a rerun.
Can you sing us a song?
There you are.
You're putting me on.
We've considered your proposal, and we've decided that we aren't able to reduce the price.
I want to know that what I'm doing is right.
I don't know why it didn't work.
Please do not smoke here.
Did I do something wrong?
Can you help me a little?
Do you have to do this every time?
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
People like him because he is kind.
Let me carry your suitcase for you.
Autumn is my favorite season.
I went to the hospital yesterday.
Tom left his keys on the table.
This is impossible for me.
What's your favorite smell?
I know I'll be able to do it.
You're stubborn.
I brought you some cookies.
He is not as tall as his brother.
You didn't need to hurry. You got here too early anyway.
I am wasting my time.
They are artists.
The dove is a symbol of peace.
Would you mind leaving the room?
I'm not sure I can trust him.
Not many survive this disease.
I didn't get any of that.
I missed supper.
I'm crazy.
I ran as quickly as I could.
I liked your comment.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm drinking orange juice.
I'm done with all of that.
I wonder if you ever think of me.
I dozed.
I think Tom should learn to speak French.
I thought I could trust you.
He was playing football with an empty can.
He says that he enjoyed it very much.
Stop talking.
Tom never cooks.
They did not keep their word.
I never for a moment imagined that I would win.
It could be anybody.
I'm sick of it.
There's been a lot of rain this month.
We had no secrets.
It's hard for me to live on my small income.
It doesn't look like anybody's home.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
The law doesn't apply to this case.
Opinion is divided on this point.
I could never forgive myself if I did that.
If you have something to say, say it to my face.
I want to do it for you.
You're annoying.
The city fell to the enemy.
I've always wanted to be a father.
Warn Tom.
You shouldn't drink stagnant water.
Could you turn off the TV?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
Roll down the window.
I have a solution in mind.
He is likely to win the game.
You're probably too young to understand this.
It won't stop bleeding.
Hey, you! What are you doing?
Can that be achieved?
The old woman was nearly run over.
I don't know why you don't like him.
We don't know what they want to use it for.
I'm afraid we won't be able to help you tomorrow.
What's the weirdest thing that has ever happened to you?
Why don't you take your coat off?
I stayed home because I had a bad cold.
Think about your future.
I bet you're talking about Tom.
They're lucky to be alive.
I've always been here for you.
I woke up at 6:30.
It's an intriguing theory, but I don't see how it can be tested.
I'm as curious as you are.
She is two years older than you.
I see you are ready.
I think it's time for me to change jobs.
I was outraged, too.
May I have a program?
This book was very interesting.
They should have the right to decide for themselves.
Does anyone know you're here?
I've seen enough.
Please take me home.
I will fight.
Does this bus go to the center of town?
He cheated on me.
He is not old enough to vote.
He made her a new coat.
I never want to see you again.
Are you telling me that I can't go?
Have you ever driven a sports car?
Have you considered that?
Our plan worked.
If I'd known it, I'd have told you.
I don't like your coming late every day.
I spent last Sunday reading a novel.
She is an appalling cook.
I'll see you next month.
I figured something was up.
You're very resourceful.
I don't have a gun.
I need some.
Tom got up and walked to the door.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I haven't decided which job to apply for.
Everything is gone.
You're really absent-minded.
Are you a policeman?
I'll give you a book.
You don't know German, do you?
She comes to see me from time to time.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
His speech was not altogether bad.
Forgive me, I'm a bit nervous.
I'm positive.
I'm not paying for this.
They're right behind you.
I got a letter from her.
Have you finished breakfast yet?
I reckon that's a good idea.
Tom said you wanted to talk to me.
He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.
That's how he discovered the comet.
She lives in the village.
I squeezed the juice out of the oranges.
Go back to your seat.
Tom read the story out loud.
You should have seen me.
You should protect your eyes from direct sunlight.
She had no choice but to accept her fate.
Can you make a salad?
Try to stop me.
Generally speaking, little girls are fond of dolls.
Write in ink.
Tom lied to the cops.
Water power turns the wheel.
I liked it a lot.
The children are cold.
Why are you lying?
This winter is warm.
My wife showed excellent taste in decorating the room.
All the flowers in the garden withered.
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Tom should've worked harder.
I don't mind at all.
She thanked him for his help.
I know why Tom doesn't do that.
Perhaps that's true.
Blue is my favorite color.
I'm as shocked as you are.
He saved me from danger.
She keeps her diary in English.
I have no time to explain this in detail.
Why are you all so happy?
I must be leaving now.
Turkey was stronger than Greece.
Where's the admission's office?
If the alarm rings, walk, don't run.
I've asked you this question before.
She kicked the door.
Can you spare a buck?
These shirts are selling like hotcakes.
Tom didn't take off his hat.
I want to know what's going on out there.
How very curious!
Show me what you have in your pocket.
He lost his sight in the accident.
Have you tried one of these?
There are two zeros in the number "2010."
I'll give you a prescription.
Is that a bird?
How come you didn't come to the party?
He was buried in this graveyard.
Can you think of anyone more suitable?
English is taught in most countries.
I went by bus as far as London.
Whatever you do, don't blink.
I need some good advice.
Tom will like it.
I think we should try it.
She could feel her knees shaking.
The rainforests are disappearing at the rate of tens of thousands of hectares a day.
I wanted to talk about it.
I was thinking about getting married.
Would you like to drink anything?
Did I hurt your feelings?
I did everything you asked.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Did you put it somewhere?
The answer is no.
That diamond ring cost an arm and a leg.
Express your idea clearly.
How often do you brush your teeth?
Tell me which one you want.
We understand you perfectly.
I don't remember anything happening.
Have you read this yet?
Don't be crazy.
Tom asked Mary several questions.
Would you do it?
Leave me alone.
I like summer, but I can't stand the heat.
I don't like what he said.
I made sure of that.
The box is too heavy to carry.
It's too dangerous for you to stay here.
They're amazing.
This is correct.
I can't explain the difference between those two.
She can speak French.
You shouldn't have done that.
I know what it's like to be poor.
We were just about to call you.
I can't give you anything.
She held him tightly and never wanted to let go.
We have different points of view.
What happened? Why are you crying?
Did you come here alone?
If you don't eat breakfast, you'll probably be hungry during the morning and won't be as efficient at work as you could be.
I think Tom has been punished enough.
Give me one good reason.
Everyone is looking forward to watching the game.
He accepted my idea.
That's exactly what we need.
What are you going to do tonight?
That's what's wrong with you.
Don't you tell me my job.
I talked to everybody.
Don't worry about me.
Do you mind if I use your phone? "No, please go ahead."
I think Tom may be hurt.
He will not agree with us.
I haven't read any of his letters.
Does this cap belong to you?
I thought you would come.
We'll talk at dinner.
I thought you could use this.
She was sick in bed yesterday.
The fugitive crossed the river.
Mother gets up earliest in my family.
Did you make it by yourself?
Tom is a common name.
I stayed at a cheap hotel.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
We're still vulnerable.
I was bored, so I wandered around town.
This is what happens when you don't pay attention to what you're doing.
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday.
How did you get here so fast?
We must speak.
The place was packed to the brim last night.
You must be careful not to make him angry.
What just happened?
Come and see me when it is convenient for you.
I didn't know you were awake.
She thought for a few minutes.
I'm not going to back down.
I'm being paid to do this.
What do you see?
Tom knows a girl named Mary.
He's two years older than Mary is.
What a hypocrite!
You've been busy, haven't you?
We're all bored.
Your English has improved considerably.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
You have a lot of nerve!
The sun is rising.
Did you have a good summer?
Let me go.
A passing car splashed water on us.
You must not give up.
She was determined never to talk to him again.
She has fallen in love with me.
Tom can't come today.
I'm glad to be of some help to you.
I don't need a reason.
I'm going there alone.
It's best to put covers on paperbacks.
How many days are there until Christmas?
What is all that stuff?
Why did Tom want it?
You've got a big day tomorrow.
Welcome to the club.
There's a big problem.
What time does the club open?
He was not aware of the danger.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
That was unexpected.
Does she play piano?
The child had no overcoat on although it was very cold.
Tom is a lot busier than I am.
Take this table away.
What's that stain?
She talks a lot.
Tom found it fairly easy to follow Mary without being seen.
Are you telling me you've never studied French?
Tom left just before Mary.
Did Tom stay?
You must not give up.
I felt sorry for you.
You're too polite.
Look at that picture.
They look confused.
They're downstairs.
They were not pleased.
Who took part in the contest?
I need thread to sew on this button.
Tom is a French teacher.
Does he have any brothers?
Do you fancy a drink?
I can't do it.
I know the boy.
We're not going to do this anymore.
We'll follow.
I hope we didn't wake you.
Do you think the situation can improve?

I ran downstairs.
Did you really give Tom a key to your apartment?

You're so beautiful in that dress.
Keep the window closed.

You aren't like the others.
They'll take me away.
Do you mind if we come in?
I didn't mean it.
I have my doubts about Tom.
Would you like to hear more?
Tom is far from satisfied with Mary's work.
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
Would you like to have another beer?
Why don't you go talk to him?
Are you seriously thinking about driving all night?
He's at her side.
Eat a lot of vegetables.
Nobody wants to do that.
Isn't that awful?
I'll take in the washing before it rains.
He took over the business from his father.
He was busy when I called him up.
He flew to Paris.

Tom was taken by surprise.
He loves her. She loves him, too.
Taste this.
I've just arrived at the station.
Tom wanted Mary to wait for him at the library.
I can't believe I just said that.
You recognized him, didn't you?
Search everyone who comes into this room.
He went on reading the book as if nothing had happened.
Tom has a really good sense of direction.
There's no choice.
I really want you to quit.
He came into my room.
She did not eat anything until she was rescued.
The more you play, the better you'll get.
No doubt he will pass the examination.

Aren't you sick of eating fast food?
May I be honest?
We're quite alone.
The whole class took the test.
They arrived in England a week ago.
They did it in front of the staff.
It's not really that relaxing.
I thought you were bluffing.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
What do you think of this red hat?
I'm going to go now.
He's so thin that he looks like a skeleton.
Put on the hat.
She is good at imitating him.
What exactly went on here last night?
I'm not comfortable.
This is not natural.
Now it's time for the weather forecast.
She was advised by him to lose weight.
That's why Tom left.
Did you like the movie?
We discussed what to do.

I hope you don't mind.
Lend me as much money you can.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
It's been ten years since he died.
She was crying.
He did his best.
It's a lot more fun than I thought it would be.

She is guilty of stealing.
That's not our only problem.
Everything happened all at once.
I guess it's impossible for me to learn how to play the oboe.

You've been infected.
You are hearing things.
Guess what I want to talk about.
You can't make us stop.
This letter is addressed to you.
His watch is ten minutes slow.
A cold wind was blowing on his face.
Bacteria are everywhere.
He was too busy to notice it.
Don't go back to sleep!
Are you motivated?
I think you know what I'm talking about.
You spend too much time in front of your computer.

I know you want to make me happy.
Let's wait here until she comes back.
Tom wanted to be paid in cash.
I gave up all hope of survival.

These shoes fit my feet.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
Do you want a ticket?

I would like you to stay with me.
Had she known the results, she would have been shocked.
I'll go wherever you want me to go.

Is this radio yours?
Nobody knows who killed Tom.
Tom, this is for you.
It was his car, not mine, that broke down yesterday.
I should thank you.
He made no effort to apologize.

Atomic energy can be utilized for peaceful purposes.
We saw it.
He managed to escape through a window.
I think it's time for me to get my own place.
He, and he alone, must go.
What do you like to do in your free time?
I moved into a new apartment.
The doctor told her that she should take a rest.
I brought a book.
I play tennis all the year around.
I really have missed you.
Doctors were called to the White House.
This morning I missed the 8:30 train by five minutes.
This hotel belongs to my brother-in-law.
I think we need to find out who Tom plans to give that to.
He did not get up early in the morning.
Tom only mentioned Mary twice.
Would you please lock the door?
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
You're the oldest.
I can't stand it that she's suffering so.
Bread is half price today.
I gave her her dictionary back.
I suppose he's got a point.
Are you sure this is the right address?
You shouldn't cancel the meeting.
I feel like I've been cheated.
You let me down.
I'll lend you the tools that you need to do that.
I was not conscious of her presence.
I'd like to see your ticket, please.
We need to leave.
Those glasses suit you.
Get back in the house.
I love collecting stones at the beach.
She can't be over thirty.
You should come over this evening for dinner.
She is wearing a blue dress.
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
This isn't sugar.
Tom gave them a general idea of what he wanted.
Actually, you're right.
He stood against the wall.
You have no choice.
Get Tom to help you.
It's a good start.
This clock loses three minutes a day.
That's how it is.
Don't call Tom at his home after 2:30.
After the rain, there were puddles on the street.
Do you want me to come back?
She advised him to drink more milk.
I was deeply affected when I heard of his death.
I coughed up blood.
I can't invite all my friends at once.
Somebody laughed.
That's my money.
This is no time to be funny.
This is residential property.
What are the rules of engagement?
We heard gunshots from next door.
How would you define normal?
I wish I were rich enough to buy a car like that.
Are they really serious?
It'll probably rain tomorrow.
His brother goes to school by bus.
I met him in January.
Please do what we asked you to do.
It started to snow.
I'll drive Tom home.
I can ride a horse.
You don't scare me.
I am all alone in a foreign country.
I needed help.
Tom left town.
I was so hungry that I ate it.
He was exposed to danger.
She looked at him angrily.
Everyone knows the law.
I have nothing further to say.
Who is it? "It's your mother."
All of you did good work.
Tom is afraid of heights.
Are you guys still together?
Get lost!
Excuse me, do you have the time?
It's very kind of you to invite me to your birthday party.
Three of the attackers were killed.
Is this serious?
The tunnel caved in because of the earthquake the other day.
It was not my intention.
I have a lot of things to do.
Call me if you have any problems.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
I just don't want there to be any bloodshed.
I've got some money saved up.
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
He always borrows money from me.
Tom didn't come to school today because he had to go to a funeral.
All of a sudden, all the lights went out.
Where are they taking you?
Why are you with me?
You don't have to tell me this.
He knows how to make a radio.
I need three volunteers.
Tom went home for the weekend.
Are your parents with you?
Can you look at me?
I hope Tom will be very happy.
You're really gorgeous.
I wish I could live in a house that nice.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
I still enjoy that.
Tom is writing a book.
I will need your help.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom is like that.
She extended her stay by five days.
That movie was terrible.
I couldn't hear Tom.
We have exams right after summer vacation.
I don't like coffee.
Your dog always barks at me.
I want to know what I'm buying.
He gave a tip as a sign of gratitude.
Do you plan to go abroad?
Stay with us.
Look, I'll show you.
He whipped out his sword.
I talked to everybody.
They need investors.
Did you know this was coming down?
I assure you that an error like this will never happen again.
Was anyone arrested?
I found that restaurant by accident.
I like fresh air.
There must be a logical explanation for this.
I should've expected this to happen.
I'm glad to hear it.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
Tom didn't like the concert very much.
No one I know writes letters anymore.
I waited for ten minutes.
There's a rumor going around that she got a new job.
You need to learn how to be assertive.
She apologized for having offended him.
Do we have to speak French?
It's now fairly common.
We both are friends.
Here's a towel you can use.
I am grateful to you for your kindness.
I didn't want you to know.
I know lots of songs.
Your life depends on it.
You didn't miss a thing.
I'll let you get back to work.
You're not allowed to swim here.
I could really make things hard for you, you know.
You really annoy me.
There's no entertainment for young people around here.
Tom had a difficult job.
I'll show you the way out.
Why is this door open?
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.
I was daydreaming.
I have trouble sleeping at night.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
He often sits for many hours reading books.
He asked us not to make any noise.
Are you falling for me?
I spent my vacation at the beach.
This word is derived from Latin.
He tried to gain her affection.
She threatened to set our house on fire.
I don't need your protection.
I don't know where that is.
Your prophecy has come true.
Somebody came to see me while I was out.
It's a waste.
Which wine goes best with red meat?
I have connections in the government.
I'm an extremely humble person.
I do that more than once a week.
Tom is at school today.
They were talking about you.
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
Many Peruvians have the habit of chewing coca leaves.
What're you all dressed up for?
Don't go in that building.
Compared to our house, yours is a mansion.
I felt depressed.
You intimidate Tom.
She advised him not to drive too fast.
Can you supply me with all I need?
What's it all mean?
Thank you for teaching me how to do this.
You're lucky to have a job.
Don't you want to talk to Tom about it?
Let me pay for it.
That was not an earthquake.
It's time to get serious.
You're thirty thousand dollars in debt.
My grandparents had a house in Boston.
I have to complete a paper on the Japanese economy.
He passed the examination.
Yeah, you're right.
Tom is hiding something. I know it.
Children should not be spoiled.
We said nothing.
I made a mistake.
There are three problems.
It's already seven.
Don't make me do this.
Everyone kept quiet.
It's time for us to get ready.
I'm going to the supermarket to do some shopping.
I think Tom is selfish.
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
You're sloshed.
We all stood up at once.
Please be honest.
What precisely does that mean?
You should've turned left.
I knew this day was going to come.
You have to come with me.
What museums would you like to visit?
It was a mistake to refuse his assistance.
Tom can't swim as fast as Mary.
There is nothing like a walk.
I'll be at home in the morning.
Take an umbrella. It's likely to rain.
You need a key to open the box.
Hey, where are you?
Last night's game was exciting.
Tom looks intrigued.
Which way is the beach?
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
It's on the eighth floor.
I enjoy cooking, but I don't like the cleaning up afterwards.
There are 31 days in December.
I could not afford to buy a bicycle.
Be honest with me.
I saw the man jump.
Tom was accused of doing sloppy work.
He made it known to his friends that he was unwilling to run for the election.
Come early so we can discuss the plans.
I've warned you before about this.
English is useful in diplomacy and tourism.
She is currently in danger.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Do you want to touch it?
I don't know Russian.
Let's focus on that.
She cleared the dishes from the table after dinner.
Maybe Tom won't go to Boston on this trip.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom told me to treat others with respect.
Tell me this isn't true.
I will survive.
Are you pregnant?
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
Tom fell in love with a pretty girl.
What can be the meaning of this?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
My dad died when I was thirteen.
Of all the films I rented, this is the only one worth seeing.
You seem confident.
I support him.
You shouldn't talk when the teacher's talking.
He studied the way birds fly.
Will the weather be good tomorrow?
You'll be hearing from us soon.
I thought this pair of shoes would last longer.
He is preparing for the test.
This is my CD.
Tom won't be back for a week.
Does your wife know?
You aren't as short as I am.
I'd rather not answer that question.
There are twenty-four hours in a day.
Nothing is more important than health.
Where's an ATM?
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Are there still enough chairs for everyone?
Please do not write in this library book.
I only have eyes for you.
I just want to check something.
He is having lunch.
I have another idea.
Would he like that?
It's a change for the worse.
Bring me today's paper.
She would not change her mind.
I wish I had a roommate to hang out with.
Who did you vote for in the election?
Do as you like.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
Tom got very mad.
We took an examination in math last week.
Pleased to meet you.
Come whenever you want to.
It matters.
Are you serious?
Don't smoke.
My coat is missing three buttons.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
Do you own a computer?
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
You can do it if you put your mind to it.
I like your scarf.
I'm a little curious.
That seemed to help.
It's kind of fun.
Don't make me leave.
I agree with you completely.
How much milk is there left?
I didn't know he drank so much.
No one takes me seriously.
Have a look.
This encyclopaedia is convenient for looking up things.
Tom and I keep in touch.
She wants to dance.
He found his father lying in the kitchen.
We're here with our children.
I'll be thinking of you every day while I'm away.
Stop shouting.
She must have worked very hard.
The car is blue.
How much is this?
How much did it cost us?
There's no one to look after her.
I'm looking for a job.
I'd rather be a bird than a fish.
Deal us the cards.
I think you must be tired.
Enjoy your stay.
I will leave as soon as the bell rings.
He felt ill at ease.
Tell them that they're wrong.
That's not what I heard.
I know where you live.
You've been cleared of all charges.
What's your favorite web browser?
I've never been able to talk to Tom.
How much did the tickets cost you?
I did everything in my power to protect her from you.
Would you like me to tell the truth?
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
I love your son.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
Don't blame it on her.
The street is wet.
Our cat is missing.
He said that he had a lot of money.
I'd be unhappy if that happened again.
I can solve this problem.
I was fired.
How fast can you do it?
Is there anybody here you don't know?
Is that a fox?
Have you fed the dog?
I'll call you as soon as I've finished.
I'm prepared.
He cried with joy.
Please give me a piece of bread.
I bet you didn't know that.
We're wasting precious time.
That's the fastest train in the world.
You may open the window.
I have a part-time job working as a Santa at the mall.
Tom didn't talk about it.
They have plenty of water.
Are you talking about this?
Don't be afraid.
I walked alone.
I studied English for four years with a native speaker.
I forgot to write the address on the envelope.
Tom is the youngest of the three boys.
We're plastered.
What's in the bag?
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
She cannot play the piano.
He cried as if he were a boy of six.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Isn't that what you're trying to tell me?
I've decided to stay in Boston.
The traffic light turned green.
It's a scam.
I'm no match for Tom.
Tom isn't a bad guy.
I'd like to take a couple of days off next week.
Why do you want to go to Boston?
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
Is there any salt left?
He exhaled loudly.
I'd like to buy eye drops.
Are you happy?
Just go in and tell the boss you want a raise. "That's easier said than done."
Let me deal with this.
I don't want to talk.
I work every day except Sunday.
Yesterday I bought a book.
She has a pretty doll.

Unfortunately, she lives abroad.
My hens laid fewer eggs last year.
The policeman arrested the thief.
Tom tried to kiss Mary.
Your secret will be safe with me.
Since it's written in easy French, I can understand it.
How are you?
You are a doctor.
I still have the book from last semester.
Tom said he'd rather not see that movie.
You have been busy.
I'm used to driving a truck.
Playing the piano isn't easy.
I can't go to the restaurant with you tonight.
I don't think anyone noticed what we did.
I don't think that's a coincidence.
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
I've got to get to work.
I'm surprised to see you.
Please tell me your name.
The Jacksons have three dogs and three cats.
It began to rain cats and dogs.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
I was tired from doing my homework.
He asked for food.
I'm in love with you and I want to marry you.
Hey, we aren't done yet.
What made you change your mind?
What's the weight of your suitcase?
Are you close to your parents?
Are you busy?
I'd like to hear what your opinion is.
You never gave up.
I wasn't ready for what was about to happen.
The parking lot in front of the bank was completely full.
My room is always neat.
I am grateful to them.
Judging from the look of the sky, it will clear up in the afternoon.
A field of grass can be quite beautiful.
I'll sue you.
I ate your piece of cake.
The earth is where we all live.
We chose a hotel near the museums.
She seemed to have been ill.
Do you recognize that girl?

We heard the door shut.
My mother is busy preparing supper.
Who would buy this?
You speak a bit too fast for me. Could you speak a bit more slowly, please?
The taxi picked up two passengers.
I'm surviving.
I remember seeing her.

That's just common sense.
I want you to know that I believe you.
Let's keep this a secret, OK?

He has two cars.
The streets were covered with snow.
Tom tried to talk to us in French.
The dog was out of breath.
Guess who won.
She heard him sing.
Where are your people?
It was the calm before the storm.
I don't have a choice.
You're smashed.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
You must get off at the next station.
He wants the money.
Could you tell us what happened next?
Would you do something for me?
I spoke loudly so that everyone could hear me.
We all wish for happiness.
I don't think Tom knows how to dance.
I knew what Tom meant.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
Thank you for your purchase.
What she lacks in charisma she makes up for with hard work.
We're just like brothers.
I'm sorry, I'm busy right now.
I got to know her through one of my friends.
Are they coming back tonight?
Does she play the piano?
We're close to a solution.
You know what they say.
A doctor was sent for at once.
She quickly went up the stairs.
I enjoyed myself a lot.
Please write your date of birth here.

I am about as big as my father now.
Let's be happy.
My mother always gets up earlier in the morning.
We can't fail.
I understand your position perfectly.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I don't really care how you do it.
It's obvious.
We have two daughters and one son.
We lost sight of them over half an hour ago.
You'd like Tom.
I will work.
I'm trying to talk to you.

This message is for Tom.
You're very astute.
Tom hugged Mary.

I need you in my life.
Tell us all about it.
I don't think he'll come.
May I call you tomorrow?
I'd love to do it.
Would you sing us a song in English?
At the moment, I have a pretty good job.

They were not impressed.
I can't help the way I feel about you.
How much do you spend on food every month?
I would like to ask a question.
Tom asked Mary to get him a cup of coffee.
Turn on the light. I can't see anything.
Tom has begun to look for a job.
It may be true.

Who was here?

I'm headed back into town.
Do you think Tom knows?
How did you two meet?
It's insanely complex.
Her skin is smooth.
I don't need to know.
I will do as you say.
Are you sure you just want water?
I think it is about time we changed our ways of disposing of waste.
I'll never speak to you again.
Don't be upset.
It's my job.
Hurry up, and you'll catch the train.
Thank you for your kind words.
What's the next station?

If you were in my place, what would you do?
You are a good cook, aren't you?

His sister looks young.
I remember that vividly.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you.
You don't need to worry about that kind of thing anymore.
They'll eat those.
Do you live alone?
I know you love Tom.
You're just a boy.
Do you need a ride?
They had cleared the obstacle from the road.
Father is coming home tomorrow.
You haven't aged a day.
Tom has written a book.
I thought hard.
He walked across the garden.
Thanks for the cup of coffee.
Do you want another piece of pie?
Make an effort.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
They're right behind you.
You don't seem very satisfied.
The storm developed into a typhoon.
Do you have any idea how important your test grades are?
I think that's a great idea.
Have a drink while you're waiting.

We weren't at home yesterday.
Let's end this.
Are we being charged with something?
You are good.
I love horses.
Maybe that's the real problem.
I hope you found everything.
I asked the stranger what his name was.
Your efforts came to nothing.
My dog sometimes eats grass.
She is my girlfriend.
Several people are already waiting.
They both laughed.
Tom takes the trash out every day at six o'clock.
I sent it to you two days ago.
They told me to stay in the car.
Tom knows where the others are, I think.
We reached the top of the mountain.
I think that he is right.
I'll stay a few more days.
I want you to run to the store for me.
We all understand.
Do you know of a good motel in the area?
It's mine.
Am I approved?
You have no idea how important you are to me.
Do you know when she will come?
It's incredible.
What exactly are you looking for?
I thought you were serious.
We don't have to go.
How did you lose your arm?
A square has four sides.
This is my choice.
They're going to find you.
We're very different.
You're Germans, aren't you?
He seems to be rich.
She must have forgotten all about the promise.
You should go to mass more often.
Do you get it?
I can't find the right words.
I go to the movies once a month.
We have illustrated the story with pictures.
The police are after you.
It's the biggest house in the neighborhood.
I hear you were grounded.
It's a strange situation.
I assure you Tom will be perfectly safe.
That small star is brightest.
You put in too much pepper.
I have been living here for a long time.
Did I embarrass you?
Can I buy only the lenses?
He left his keys in the car.
Do we have to do all that?
Who's volunteering?
It was hard.
It is too expensive for me to buy.
She's about the same height as you.
That's the one thing I'm sure of.
You're all happy.
I really appreciate your coming.
I have an account at that book shop.
I really should be going.
We're all on the same team.
Would doing that be easy?
It might rain before evening.
There's been a death in his family.
That's really great!
Many languages use English words.
Everyone's watching.
My left arm is asleep.
Prices are lower in Kobe.
What kind of information are you looking for?
Half the apples that Tom gave me were rotten.
I have a large bedroom.
I told Tom why I wanted to do that.
Have you ever seen a spider spinning its web?
This is the only one I have.
I know Tom is downstairs.
She asked him to open the window.
Don't be so impatient.
He is a bad person.
Would you like some help?
You think I'm stupid, don't you?
Why are you interested?
We can see many stars tonight.
I do sympathize with you.
Look at me when I talk to you!
I may be wrong.
I care about all of you.
I've got everything I want.
Will you all be here tomorrow?
A car cut in.
You're not the only woman here.
Tom cooks for us every day.
There's no point in waiting.
I'd like to speak to the manager.
I'd better do something before the problem gets any worse.
How certain are you that he's a criminal?
What is your problem?
The English Channel separates France from England.
I can't just kick Tom out.
Go straight down this street and turn right at the third light.
Do I have to take this medicine?
I think you're completely right.
You're quite smart.
She put some of the ointment on her hands.
He fled when he saw me.
I've only got one left.
Let's make it three o'clock.
Let's not be enemies.
Can you shut the door on your way out?
You made a fool of yourself.
Mind your own business!
Who moved the furniture?
We have tried everything.
Where do I go then?
Let's take a tea break.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
I'm decorating the classroom.
I hid myself behind a curtain.
I love reading.
You didn't warn me.
I'm on duty.
How did that happen?
We stayed at a nice hotel.
You need to move on.
I can do it if you give me a chance.
Please give me a break.
Draw a circle.
In a way you are right, but I still have doubts.
Don't ever think otherwise.
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
Can I see, too?
Did anyone see you come in here?
She sued him.
I'm feeling hungry.
You can't buy it anymore.
What can I give you in return?
You're silly.
When I was a child, I used to go to the seashore every summer.
I got here last night.
We are not Americans.
Don't worry about things that aren't important.
This and no more.
I took a picture.
I'd buy that.
He hit on a splendid idea.
It's getting cold here.
We ran around the park.
I cooked him dinner.
I know what you're doing.
He has a good reputation.
You don't have to lie.
There's an answer to everything.
We were impressed.
Who do you think you're talking to here?
You ought not to miss it.
You don't have to talk.
I have to make sure everything is OK.
You are twice as strong as me.
There are no drugs here.
I don't know why I keep doing that.
This book is interesting.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
I'm feeling dizzy.
I'll have it done before 2:30.
Close the window before you leave.
They're all waiting.
That was what I was going to say.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
I don't want you to worry.
He knows better than to marry her.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
The antelope ran away.
Tom's dog stood up.
I'm still thirsty.
What foods are you allergic to?
You are a good person.
You are not at all wrong.
Bring a camera.
Tom wants to buy a house in Boston.
They said there was not enough time for a full investigation.
Who sent you here?
I miss college.
How did I let this happen?
What's the matter with you?
Tom searched the room.
I can't wait to go.
I lost your phone number.
Just leave me alone.
That's an incredible story.
I have to show you something.
I may be able to come to your office Monday afternoon.
You've brightened my day.
You can't know that for sure.
You'll come back, won't you?
Do you find that washing machine easy to use?
She had changed so much that I couldn't recognize her.
I don't expect you'd remember.
I was entirely ignorant of the matter.
I've always considered you a close friend.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
Tom is in a hurry to do that.
They were members of the middle class.
Tom sent Mary a text message.
I'm happy, too.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Father isn't at home.
The army is in the north to protect the border.
She advised him to come back at once.
I want to hear who won.
Enjoy it while you can.
I wonder who they are.
Are you American?
What's the name of the company you work for?

I couldn't hear anything.
Why would I be nervous?
I want to go out.

I might have mentioned it.
We better be going.
I think you're interesting.
I don't want the ring.
They're awake.
We can't attend.
What's this room?

You should go home now.
Rest is important.
She's busy now and can't talk with you.
I'm glad you could be here.
Don't be too dependent on others.
She struggled to get up.
You cannot live by love alone.
What more could one ask for?
She advised him on what books to read.

It is difficult to get him to do anything on the spur of the moment.
I think that was the plan.
I'm easygoing.
Where is your luggage?

They stopped talking.
Aren't you going to take your coat off?
Everybody will be tired.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer.
Just tell us the truth.
I'm sick of hospitals.
After reading his books I feel I can construct a house.
They crashed.
They're smiling.
I thought I heard you.
How much money do you have on you right now?
I know Tom is a cat lover.
You must do as I say.
Tom salted his eggs.
How can I pay?
He strayed from his group.
When will the world come to an end?

Are you almost finished?
I plan to reply to his letter right away.
Can you make out the meaning easily?
You're very clever.
I should've gone home.
Shall I have him call you when he gets back? "Yes, please."
He is no more a fool than you are.
I'm sorry I'm such a big disappointment to you.
You won't be the first.
Stop squabbling.
They laugh at him behind his back.
You'd better hand that over.

Tom is playing.
He was shot to death.
I'm on my way to visit a friend who's in the hospital.
See what I mean?

She always gets up at six.
I share his opinion.
I liked walking alone on the deserted beach.

He's a community leader.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
This material stretches easily.
This is a company car.

It's not a conspiracy.

All the members of the committee hate one another.
I need you to tell me what to do.
Tom was reading a letter written in French.
I'll miss your cooking.
Tom told me he used to be rich.
I can't do that on my own.
I think you should think about the future.
Can't you help us?
One thing I've always wanted to do is learn to fly an airplane.
I suggest that you talk to Tom.
He called her bad names.
Tom doesn't want you to get hurt.
It's dangerous to go there alone.
Who'll pay the bills?
I think you did very well.
Will you entertain the guests while I get dressed?
You shouldn't always do what everyone else seems to be doing.
This suitcase is too heavy for you.
I went to the wrong address.
It's the only way.
Is this made in Switzerland?
I was very reluctant.
Did anybody else see it?
I'm sorry that I can't meet you tonight.
Tom likes to work in the garden before going to work.
Tom parked the car behind Mary's house.
She risked her life to protect her child.
I'm a member of the team.
I persuaded her to make herself comfortable.
The old lady lived in a three-room apartment by herself.
I have no desire to hurt you.
Aren't you dressed yet?
I don't know how to do it.
Tom can handle this.
Why are you so secretive?
Are you for or against his idea?
Do you study English?
I know these students.
Why didn't you just take the money?
Are you doing all right?
I'm busy, so I can't go.
She says she has no intention of having a baby until she's in her thirties.
Tom risked his life for us.
Did you do this all yourself?
We need to start working on the problem.
I know Tom is a specialist.
We were unsuccessful.
Can you pitch?
Who invited Tom to the party?
Your mother and father are dead.
Sunglasses protect our eyes from the sun.
Some things just can't be explained.
I know you did that.
He slept with the window open.
Maybe Tom doesn't like me.
Let me go.
My father believed that anyone who could not make a living in Japan was lazy.
She had her hair cut short.
This is hers.
You must not stay in bed.
I don't know why Tom didn't do it.
He committed suicide.
Did you watch the game?
Unfortunately, I don't have time today.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
It isn't always easy to know a good book from a bad one.
Tell Tom I'll be back.
I'm wondering if I love her.
Do it the way he tells you to.
Please remain seated.
I was watching a documentary.
I heard Tom say he needed to find Mary.
Are you old enough to drive?
He hid himself behind a large rock.
What would you do, if you lost your job?
My alarm didn't go off this morning.
All of my kids want to learn French.
Can I go swimming this afternoon?
An elderly person was resting under a tree.
I understand your dilemma.
The police compared the fingerprints on the gun with those on the door.
She read one poem to him.
He has short hair.
I just didn't want you to think I was stingy.
She made jam from the apples.
I was kicked out of high school.
Tom enjoys telling jokes.
All of us stood up.
I just got out of jail.
We are men.
I know we're a little early.
We are badly in want of water.
She's rather clueless.
That's a complex question.
I don't spend much time studying French.
We were truly surprised.
Yes, we can go.
You may as well leave at once.
I feel a little awkward.
I like your frankness.
You must quit drinking.
Tears filled her eyes.
We have something in common.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
We're not the champions.
It was very windy.
I don't understand opera.
I found that restaurant by accident.
We have three options.
She always says no.
This picture must've been taken in 1964.
This table is heavy.
The meeting has already begun.
This is the best party I've been to all year.
It's great to have you back.
Is that my hat?
I don't feel like going to the movies tonight.
You're full of surprises.
Let's pull an all-nighter.
We appreciate your help.
The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food.
You're on the list.
Do you want to know why I lied to Tom?
The police covered the body with a sheet.
I'll be praying for you.
I hate you.
I want you to go to your room and pack your things.
I worked as a piano tuner for many years.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
The beach is swarming with people.
I'm giving you one more chance.
He made up the story.
You were my friend.
I'd like to thank you both.
Tom eats a plant-based diet.
I am at the end of my patience.
My sister is a good typist.
My watch is different from yours.
What is for dessert?
She took two weeks' leave and visited China.
Why are you so tired?
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
You don't belong here.
I didn't even think that was possible.
Are you up for it?
He looks just like a skeleton.
The children have everything they need.
We should probably ask Tom first.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
Whatever you do, don't let Tom help you.
What do we have to lose?
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
I must have made a mistake.
Tom and Mary have recently moved to Boston.
Are you in a hurry?
Don't kid me!
What a great country!
Is this the key your uncle is looking for?
Tom doesn't want to drive.
I think I've had one too many.
Can I buy you another beer?
Are you getting tired?
It works well.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
I want to thank everyone who helped me do this.
You can smoke in this room.
Abandon ship!
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
I'm suddenly tired.
She has two brothers, who work in the computer industry.
A slight cold prevented me from going to Ibusuki with my family.
Who is he talking to?
You swim well, don't you?
After that incident, he never drank again.
It's time to get serious.
I find it difficult to believe that.
I never asked you to do that.
I thought everyone was busy.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
It's too good to be true.
Do you wash your hands before meals?
My bike is nothing like yours.
Where ever did you buy it?
He learned golf by watching others and following their example.
Tom is no longer married.
Do you think this is some kind of game?
He's fluent in Japanese.
I was too stunned to talk.
Were you the one who rung the bell?
It's your decision.
When I grow up I want to be just like you.
He's a meth addict.
The stars are shining.
She helped cook lunch.
Tom doesn't really like Mary, even though he says he does.
We take it for granted that he will succeed in his business.
I can't wait all day.
Tom started shaking uncontrollably.
Tom is over 80 kilos.
Tom left his briefcase on the subway.
Start reading where you left off.
What wonderful weather!
Tom has ants in his pants.
Tom struggled to climb to the top.
I've got bills to pay.
We take that very seriously.
All three were killed.
I still don't know what to do.
I hate to put you through this.
Can I ask you for a favor?
I don't know how much time we have.
They were very kind to me.
The doors were closed.
The snow is melted.
It was cheaper than I had thought it would be.
Are those for me?
I'm bored and don't know what to do.
What a perfect day!
Tom is extremely generous.
I think you might eventually change your mind.
She sympathized with those unfortunate people.
This house is for rent.
This book will give you a clear idea of the American way of life.
I can't see well.
I am writing a letter.
I have all the money I need.
I run five miles a day.
He became financially independent.
You understand this, don't you?
I'm really not interested in history.
I'd like to get started.
Because her parents got divorced, the girl had hardly any contact with her father.
I will go out if it is fine tomorrow.
Tom took the sheets off the bed and put them into the washing machine.
Can you help me find it?
How many fish can you keep in your tank?
What was her name?
His brother was nasty to me.
It was very windy yesterday.
Don't try to pull a fast one on me!
How do you think you're doing?
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
Does anyone here speak Japanese?
I forgot to feed the dog.
You should rewrite this sentence.
He studied military history.
I can't come up with a good excuse for being late for the dentist.
You are new students.
Don't underestimate your own strength.
I can show you the pictures.
I'll be at home.
Nobody answered.
Why do you let people treat you like that?
Do you know who that guy is?
He's now a college student.
Can we afford all this?
You don't have to explain.
Who was that woman I saw you with?
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
I looked for a place to crash.
I've got two books.
Who is that boy running toward us?
I'm cooperating.
He is in business.
I don't want to listen to you.
He did what I wanted right away.
Are you frightened?
The old church on the hill dates back to the twelfth century.
I've just arrived at the station.
The food is cold.
Tom doesn't take vacations.
Where is the bathroom?
She admitted that she was wrong.
They were better than I expected.
Jump as high as you can.
I don't understand what you mean.
He trimmed his beard for the wedding.
That's the best thing that could happen to me.
What's your favorite sport?
We aren't that poor.
I was born in Kyoto in 1980.
I have a lot of work to do today.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
Was that another joke?
Your English has improved a lot.
I didn't feel like cooking.
It's not just a theory.
It's just a placebo.
Did you reserve a room at the hotel?
I go to any party I am invited to.
I'm not that cynical.
They had a boat.
I hope we can fix that.
I miss my family and my country.
I'll bring you something to eat.
I got punished for doing that.
Today is my sister's birthday.
The thief used a screwdriver to break into the car.
He's fresh out of college.
He's a creationist.
Tom is a decent sort of guy.
Don't you have any good news?
It was so still that you would have heard a pin drop.
Your name is Tom, right?
My mother spends a lot of money on clothes.
We're not allowed to do that.
It's based on a true story.
You're not welcome here.
She looked after her sister, who was in bed with a bad cold.
There's no need to hurry.
It was a stupid idea.
I'm all out of ideas.
Do you feel any better?
They told me it was your fault.
Are you seeing anybody?
I had to see you.
I was watching television when the telephone rang.
That's a very good point.
You're very brave.
What is the name of that bird?
We won.
He never turns up without making a fuss.
The beaches are less crowded in September.
His father doesn't play golf.

Tom heard a loud explosion.
It's raining hard.
Everywhere you look you can see damage caused by the earthquake.
Are you dyslexic?
I'm sorry, my father is out.
I have to speak with you immediately.
Seen from a distance, the big rock looks like an old castle.
My primary concern is your safety.
Please be careful.
I can't get involved.
I don't know who I'm going to choose.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
I ride a bike to work.
Keep listening.
This is not our problem.
They'll tell you the truth.
We're here to protect you.
I just don't know what to do.
I've got plans for you.
He has no conscience.
I've always loved you.
You take the money.
Are you ready to begin?
He gave up hope.
She would often play tricks on me.
We have to do our best.
Time is money.
I live here now.
I think it's time for me to get my own place.
I opened an account at a nearby bank.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
Let's leave the matter as it is for the present.
Tom stopped it.
That's exactly my point.
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
Nobody asked.
It's a bit too complicated for me.
Why did you leave the room?
How long are you going for?
Please give me one of these.
I'm starving.
The bathtub is dirty.
Do you know where my keys are?
Let me have a look at it.
You can't pull it off.
I was afraid you'd say that.
The storm caused a power outage.
I hate to eat alone.
My sister is engaged to him.
We've run enough for one day.
How do you want your hair cut?
I can't slow down.
I think that will be all for today.
The floor must be kept clean.
Every time I look at this picture, I think of my father.
I'll try.
Are you mad about something?
I don't like that woman.
This is child's play.
I knew you'd be mad.
Where are they?
Don't stay out all night.
Washing dishes is something I don't really enjoy doing.
Why don't you meet me out front in a few minutes?
Do you know where they come from?
Can you help me translate that into French?
All three were killed.
If you are to know a nation, you must learn its history.
You mind if I join you?
I'm vegetarian.
Are you seeing anybody right now?
I was not pleased.
You don't seem tired at all.
Do you believe Tom is innocent?
I'm here to protect you.
I can't do this alone.
It's easy to see why.
Stop crying like a little girl.
I felt a little stiff.
I am learning to play the guitar now.
Now that you know the truth, perhaps you'll feel better.
We can seat you soon.
I'm getting pretty tired of driving every morning.
I like this store.
The Jacksons moved to Boston.
Tom is voting.
I'm glad you're coming.
I got soap in my eyes.
I don't have anything else planned for today.
Don't tell my wife.
Where have you been all week?
Between you and me, Tom's idea doesn't appeal to me very much.
May I have a glass of wine, please?
Tom is nervous and excited.
Don't feed the dog.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Frankly speaking, it's difficult to understand why you want to go.
Tom understood exactly what Mary meant.
Maybe we were too optimistic.
I know your brother.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom was here?
Tom is happy.
She must have visited England last summer.
We weren't tired at all.
This is not negotiable.
I gave up smoking six months ago.
That's not the point.
I'm afraid we'll lose the game.
If you get enough rest every night, you'll feel much better.
Don't make me do it again.
I should have told someone.
It is a very sad tale.
I could never hurt you.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
I want you and me to be happy.
I have no problem with this.
I have to tell you something.
It was a very difficult story to write.
Tom needs to be more careful.
Has something happened?
This is giving me a headache.
I want you to do this right.
I'm not able to speak so fast.
Put this book on top of the others.
I'll leave the decision to you.
I want a martini.
I need you to do me a favor.
I don't know exactly how to do this.
I can't stand up.
I'd like to know exactly how much money is in my account.
Nobody does that.
Step forward.
You look happy.
Monopoly is a popular game for families to play.
They smiled at each other.
Tom said he'd rather not go to Mary's party.
Cheer up!
Is Tom at home now?
Come over here and sit down.
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.
Tom often makes the same mistakes.
The police officer put handcuffs on the suspect.
Everyone loves their father.
They're similar.
If he were here, what would he say?
Will it be much longer?
We're not living together.
He never asked me.
Be watchful.
What do you want to drink with your meal?
How can I get rid of all those fallen leaves?
I think we need to find out why Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Quit hassling me.
This is permanent.
I don't like any of these hats.
Invite whoever you like.
Can you excuse me for a minute?
Do you realize what you're doing?
I told myself to stay positive.
Tom found the leak.
Who is your favorite author?
He hates air travel.
A car was coming in this direction.
I don't get it.
Guess how much that cost me.
Let's ask.
Fingernails grow nearly four times faster than toenails.
I'm taking an exam in January.
That's the eject button. Don't touch it.
I'm afraid she won't accept my explanation.
We'll both go.
He broke the law.
Tom said Mary isn't depressed.
Is it really necessary to do that?
We don't have a pool.
Do you really want to go there?
Please follow the school rules.
She got into hot water when her boyfriend called her at work.
You shouldn't keep them waiting so long.
Who's taking responsibility for this mess?
He was burning up with fever.
Tom may change.
I tried to warn everyone.
We found the front door locked.
You still haven't told me who he is.
It was a wise decision.
These light bulbs can't all be bad.
Do you have any money on you?
Everyone's been contacted.
This invention will make you very rich.
Bilingual dictionaries are allowed.
How's your old lady doing?
Do you think Tom is sick?
You should follow your teacher's advice.
He saved us all.
Tom's rather busy just now.
She asked me how many languages I spoke.
Do you like this?
My motorcycle broke down on the way.
She is my daughter.
Classes will resume Monday.
Currently, he's our best batter.
They're treating me like a child.
He began to work to get Congress to reduce taxes.
Hey, open the door.
He is in trouble.
Do you want to make me happy?
It's not right.
Did you really think today was my birthday?
It is Tom's ambition to go to the moon.
Now that you are eighteen, you can get a driver's license.
I hurried.
Tom has been called away on business.
I just assumed you wouldn't mind.
I like your shoes.
If a burglar came into my room, I would throw something at him.
I had the same thing happen to me last month.
She took me for my brother.
He loves you very much.
Your plan didn't work.
Are you allowed to go?
You're not good at this.
Tom offered me a piece of cake.
When does he come?
I hate secrets.
Frankly, I'm not that impressed with his idea.
Can you wake me up at 7:00 tomorrow?
I don't know that word.
I am not always free on Sundays.
The body converts extra calories into fat.
Is that a bullet hole?
She would not follow my advice.
I've got to figure out what I'm doing wrong.
She made the same mistake again.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I'll go get the proper forms.
As soon as the dog saw me, it began to bark.
I'd like to meet Tom as soon as possible.
Have you ever been arrested?
I can see you're frightened.
Who ate the last donut?
He had no friend to help him.
I can't do anything until this project is done.
I'm aware of all that.
The school year is almost over.
The hawk caught a mouse.
That old man is, so to speak, a walking dictionary.
What are you so happy about?
I'm as tall as you.
Let's sing a happy song.
Can you explain how this machine works?
That's pretty strange.
Do you recognize that woman?
Who do you think that guy is?
Have you noticed anything suspicious?
You have a regular pulse.
Are the police going to arrest me?
I was just trying to be friendly.
What more do we need to make us happy?
How long have you lived in Sanda?
Do you think parents should punish their children when they lie?
You always sing.
It's a waste of resources.
I thought you might want to come along.
I wanted everything.
I have very good eyesight.
I like mathematics.
He is a good tennis player.
Everyone else waited.
You can't help me.
Tom wanted to know where it happened.
I will explain it to her.
I'm sort of an extrovert.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
That's not important, is it?
Blood spatter analysis plays an important role in determining what has happened at a crime scene.
I know her by sight, but I've never spoken to her.
Who's here?
Take a chance.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I'm terrible at math.
Don't try this at home.
She is looking for her car keys.
I always try to eat healthy food.
They slept in the same room.
It's really unbelievable, isn't it?
Draw a line on your paper.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
I knew something Tom didn't know.
Father bought me a new bicycle.
Tom was bitten by a dog.
That's not funny.
I am so exhausted!
The noise kept me awake all night.
The sea level is rising.
Today, I got up very early.
Where ever did you buy it?
It cost less than fifteen dollars.
He swindled her.
Her occupation is teaching.
This is risky and dangerous.
Mom, could you read me a bedtime story?
Can you tell us what the bank robber looked like?
I agreed to help him in his work.
You should do something with your hair.
She's teaching us French.
Stay sharp.
I'll call you back later.
I enjoyed myself.
Next time I'll come earlier.
I got up about five.
You seem upset.
He stopped to think which way to go.
Please speak in a low voice.
Did you do this?
Be merciful.
I haven't seen you in ages.
I'd heard you'd changed.
Anybody here?
I just knew I couldn't do that.
The telephone doesn't work.
We'll get a keg of beer for the party.
Can I have some of these?
Who's on duty today?
It's just blood.
She wouldn't speak to him.
Give it a shot.
The table is green.
It's quiet.
Did you hear my son play the violin?
Where's my car?
I didn't think you were needed.
They decided on the date and location of their wedding.
I'm amazed by the rate at which industries grow.
That's not what I understand.
Do you plan to go overseas?
Is Tom supposed to be doing that?
I have to go on a diet to lose weight.
I have no idea who he is.
The urban-renewal project is now well under way.
They canceled.
You were perfect.
She cleaned her room in a hurry.
I thought Tom would be at the bar.
Can you make out what he is trying to say?
Do you want to go fishing tomorrow?
What's the magic word?
I'm strongly opposed to a compromise.
I stayed home because of the rain.
I know you want to go home.
They have wine.
Didn't you read the book?
I will continue.
Tom washes his hair almost every day.
I didn't say I liked it.
Did you hurt yourself?
I'm a singer.
Had you been drinking?
How's your mother?
I have no experience.
How is this possible?
I can do this all night.
I did OK.
You're not bad.
No security system is foolproof.
Are you all right?
We're being attacked.
We have to go shopping.
It was astonishing.
I thought I was going crazy.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
Are you from around here?
I've never had a friend like you before.
This mall is so big that I can't find the exit.
She tasted the cake to see if it was sweet enough.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
I need to lose a few pounds.
Why did you say such a thing?
I had him wash the car.
Tom tried to stay quiet.
You bet I'm angry.
Are they new?
My sister showers every morning.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
They want me to organize the party.
You are seriously ill.
I just want to be perfect.
Go get a drink of water.
We felt the house shake.
We are concerned about our planet.
He talks as though he knew everything.
Help! I can't swim.
It is wrong to cheat at cards.
You're not normal.
I spoke to my uncle on the telephone.
I don't suppose anything will happen.
Isn't that enough for you?
You're being very unfair to me.
One of us will attend the meeting.
That's right!
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
One of my dreams is to one day see the aurora borealis.
The back wheels on that tractor have ball bearings the size of my fist.
Quite a few shingles flew off the roof during the storm.
I thought we had a good time.
I'd like to file a complaint.
I'll never be happy again.
Why should Tom sing that song?
I wouldn't like to work in a hospital.
Why don't we just sit here and talk?
I asked him if he knew my name.
It'll break.
You may not like this book.
Tom was stoned.
An athlete must keep in good condition.
Everybody started to leave.
She sat there in silence.
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
You were perfect.
You'd do the same for me.
We ran out of food.
We were obliged to give up our plan.
What does it look like?
The early bird catches the worm.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
Do you want coffee?
Can you please help me for just a minute?
I feel perfectly fine.
I don't think it's good for him to go alone.
Trust no one.
Spiders scare me.
I immediately thought of you.
It was a good day.
She demanded to see the manager.
You could have drowned.
Anybody want a lift?
Is this man threatening you?
Let's leave her alone.
I am going to watch TV this evening.
Have I changed that much?
You need to sober up.
You're a bodybuilder, aren't you?
We're on the same side.
Tom has a surprise for you.
You're such a liar.
She visited her husband in prison.
Tom hurried out of the building.
You can't know that for sure.
I don't think that's possible.
What is it made of?
May I have a signature?
Tom was in the passenger seat.
There are many different kinds of beauty.
Why didn't you come to the party?
I'll be with you in five minutes.
I owe you an explanation.
What's the title of the book?
Are you excited?
I haven't gotten rid of my bad cold yet.
This watch cost 70,000 yen.
She likes jazz, and I do, too.
He did the opposite.
Do your parents speak French?
Let's pretend this never happened.
The math homework proved to be easier than I had expected.
None of this makes sense.
I have rather a busy afternoon in front of me.
I said nothing, which made him more furious.
How much are you being paid to do this?
It was time to leave.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
The dolphin and trainer communicated much better than we expected.
I informed her of my arrival.
Best of luck to you.
Did you see anyone?
This is my office.
On Mondays, he's always at home.
I hear you know how to speak French.
You're the best.
Doing that will only make things worse.
She leaned on his shoulder.
He says that he enjoyed it very much.
Don't spend too much money.
Boy was I naive.
I am wondering if I could be of any service to you.
You have caused me to lose my temper.
I'll marry you.
What if I'm not lucky?

I did just like you asked.
I felt the earthquake.
I had a stroke last year.
Your father was right.

You're with friends.
Could you please tell me again when the meeting is supposed to start?
Do you know where to go or who to ask for information?
I promise you I'll keep you safe.

I don't want you to be hurt.
He goes there every day.
He left the window open.
Have you got a match?

That's crazy.
Is it my turn?
Get out of my room.
English is studied all over the world.
I work with him.
Tom did a very stupid thing.
I'll go to Australia next week.

All I want is money.
He is not always in the office in the morning.
I'm glad to see you're OK.
I want to thank everybody here.
Why didn't you come to the party?
What are you saving up for?
You want to get out of here, don't you?
I'm available.
I will get you a bike for your birthday.
I wanted something to eat.
Please don't think of it that way.
I thought we could do better.
He is reading a book. Let's leave him alone.
What a beautiful sweater!
That brown one is mine, too.
Don't tell anybody.
They say this old house is haunted.
He is a man of noble birth.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
I bought new sunglasses.
He is, without question, the best man for the job.
I have six mouths to feed.
Is there a treatment?
Men can not exist without air.
Is that your dog?
Nothing but peace can save the world.
Do what you like.
I slept like a baby.
I don't even know where.
Nobody's busy.
We're inside.
I cut the article out of the magazine.
We have a colleague in Spain.
The people I work with are all very kind.
I don't know what I want right now.
I don't know English.
Do you work on Monday?
He can swim like a fish.
Clearly you're not interested.

They're gone.
I want one.
She is not anything like her mother.
I had my bicycle stolen.
What's your husband's name?
How do you say that in French?
Tom said some men had attacked Mary.
Come run with me.
What's your favorite food?
Why don't you admit your mistake?
Tom refused to let Mary in the house.
There were many things that we simply didn't have time to do.
The garden needs to be weeded.
You're actually wrong.
Do you understand what's going on?
We can rely on Tom.
I'm on my way out.
Stop frowning.
I don't normally do that.
You don't have permission to do that.
He did the opposite.
Get ready for some action.
I don't want you to change.
I don't think I can walk any faster.
There are a lot of fish in that lake.

No students were absent.
Are you close to your family?
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
My English teacher recommended that I read these books.
I was really quite stiff.

A lot of time was wasted.
Tom left his kids at home.

What's the meaning of this phrase?
Where's that coming from?
Do we need to bring our dictionaries to class tomorrow?
Don't you think that's a bit weird?

I want to make you smile.

What's it look like?
I made him cry.

I broke up with Tom.
I have my fingers crossed.
That's no excuse.
I was absent from work yesterday.
I don't think your name's Tom.
You worry about your weight too much.
You're very skeptical.
We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.
I couldn't stand looking at it.
I will show you around the city.
I can't believe this is taking so long.

I've just finished lunch.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
You'll have to drive.
He can't be older than me.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
I slept on the bus.
You were late for work.
I gave up on the idea of buying a house.

We'd better do that before 2:30.

He's a big boy.
He's a freelance journalist.

Leave this to me.

I can be there in an hour.
Let me give you an example.
I would buy it, except that it costs too much.

So, what do you mean?

I'd like an aisle seat, please.
He is playing there.
A problem immediately arose.
The radio is a bit loud.
Could you tell me how to use the telephone?
He resigned.
Couldn't they have picked a better time?
I forgot to lock the door.
Be sensible.
Help yourselves. There's plenty more in the kitchen.
I have no idea how I got here.
I asked Tom who his French teacher was.
When did they build that?
I am reading a letter.
Do you know her?
One more person will be joining us later.
What you need is a friend.
Tom walked across the room and opened the window.
Tom goes to school.
I think we're all a bit crazy.
Please write it down.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Tom was wearing his pajamas when he opened the door.
I can't answer your question.
Do you mind if I ask a few questions?
Tom ran at full speed.
Never tell a lie.
Didn't I show you my new Mustang?

Do you think we should abandon ship?
He sounds angry.
The room in which the exam was being held was very hot.
They despise you.
Tom says he has no trouble falling asleep.
You might be correct.
There's a lot of chit-chat.

We have three boys and one girl.
You shall have my answer tomorrow.
Take whatever you want.

If that were true, what would you do?
See you all tomorrow.

That's all we can ask.
They're free.
The bicycle by the door is mine.
She won't call this evening.
Is anybody there?
Get the kid to bed.
It's impossible to change it now.
Tom has a secret weapon.
I don't recall you saying anything about that.
I visited Australia a few years ago.
Join us.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
Tom and Mary have canceled their appointments.
Why are you jealous of me?
It is getting warmer and warmer.

I seldom eat dairy products.
It's easier to learn a new language when you are young.
No one is working. Everyone's watching the World Cup.

It's about time for dinner.
How many trees are in your orchard?
Can you do that?
I think Tom told you the truth.
Listen to me carefully.
She advised him to use a bicycle.
I can respond to his question.
I don't think you should quit your job.
The moment he saw me he ran away.
We can fix this.
I live here alone.
It was very dark.
You touched my heart.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
You're not as good as you think you are.
You won't need me.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
He hung a picture on the wall.
Put it down.
Okinawa is the southernmost island in Japan.
You said you were happy.
She has a good command of English though she was brought up in Japan.
Can you do that?
Many people think I'm crazy.
The distance is hard to estimate.
I love this place.
Go straight on down this street.
You still haven't told me what your phone number is.
That's going to cause some problems.
I really didn't want to bother you again.
She didn't want him to stay any longer.
They don't make them like they used to.
They paid separately.
You can't get rid of me.
She is a reliable person.
I bought a new bag.
That dog tries to eat just about anything he lays his eyes on.
Did they say what happened?
The fog is getting thicker.
Tom doesn't want to take that kind of risk.
He is roasting coffee beans.
They invited me to the party.
I'm already rich.
Tom is at his parents' house.
He doesn't love his girlfriend.
Did you read everything?
He'll be sure to smell a rat if I'm with you.
Tom knows what he's talking about.
My mother gets up early every morning.
You look tired.
I didn't think you'd believe me.
I smell something burning.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
Tom is still not satisfied.
The door remained closed.
The door is locked at nine every night.
I am no match for him.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Was there enough money?
I like winter.
I miss you when you're not here.
We never voted.
She cooks well.
I got the gist of what he was saying.
I saw a cottage in the distance.
Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news.
I know exactly what I'm asking.
I had a mental breakdown.
Now that he has gone, we miss him very much.
Tom is probably not busy right now.
I accompanied her on a walk.
OK, I think I got it.
Is Tom always like this?
She kept on working.
You need to go.
This is too much.
Tom didn't have anything to say.
She gives him the creeps.
Will you please put that in simpler words?
I'd like to have more time to talk with you.
I require your assistance.
We're all prisoners.
He's gone into hiding.
Do you fish?
He is far from happy.
Tom got out of the bath, dried himself off, and put his clothes on.
I've had enough of this.
Tom said he isn't used to this kind of food.
What makes you think I'm going to go to Boston with Tom?
I want a book.
The bus stopped, but no one got out.
I wish I could be the man you want me to be.
Where did that come from?
They plotted against the government.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
You're talented.
He won't talk to her and she won't talk to him.
I won't be able to eat all this.
Tom only does that when he's tired.
This was Tom's idea, wasn't it?
Take it easy!
I'm really proud of it.
It wasn't a surprise.
Tom asked Mary about her life in Australia.
I wish Tom would spend more time at home.
It is none of your business.
I really wish I knew how to do that.
I came here hoping to see Tom.
They got a warm reception.
Can I borrow your pen for a few minutes?
If it were true, what would you do?
You can count on that.
I believe I am in the right.
The soup was too hot.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
You're scaring me.
Tom is a great drummer.
I hardly know anything about you.
They fell into each other's arms.
I told her once and for all that I wouldn't go shopping with her.
That's fun.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Would you mind if I have a look?
I asked him to make four copies of the letter.
We're doing well.
Do you see them?
Isn't she a doctor?
His father is conservative and old-fashioned.
How did you and Tom first meet?
A good night's sleep will do you a world of good.
The experience soured his outlook on life.
I used to think that only bears hibernate, but the teacher said that turtles do as well.
Tom asked Mary who had given her the picture.
I like to eat.
We have a traitor among us.
Tom called me almost every day while he was in Boston.
I don't really know what you mean.
Do you have something to say to me?
Boston is one of the cities that I really want to visit.
Did you kiss anybody?
You don't have a clue.
Go outside.
When out at sea, to keep the fish that is caught from spoiling, it is immediately refrigerated.
I don't care how long it takes.
I used to go to church on Sunday.
We're ready to go.
That's a very nice suit.
She moved my clothes.
The alarm rang and everyone had to evacuate.
I'm not advocating that.
I can't figure out how to register a new domain name.
Crossing that desert is dangerous.
I'm too tired to do that right now.
Isn't it about time you guys buried the hatchet and let bygones be bygones?
It is time to shut the gate.
I'm being serious.
Why don't you give up?
If you don't study harder, you'll fail for sure.
What did they bring me?
I am glad to help you.
Will it stop raining soon? "I'm afraid not."
I envy him.
You should work in the interests of humanity.
They're doing it right.
It's going to rain soon.
He has nothing against it.
They'll stop at nothing to achieve their political goals.
I want you to be my partner.
Do you want me to leave?
I don't love her anymore.
What do you think they want?
I will sit here until he sings.
I called him up.
Were there any problems?
Did I forget to mention that?
I once knew a girl that snorted every time she laughed.
I stuck my hands in my pockets.
He has a large desk in his small room.
There's a huge mark up on imported electronic goods.
You should be more careful.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
No one knows his address but Tom.
Is that what you want me to say?
I already know how to dance.
I just got back three hours ago.
She advised him not to drive too fast.
There are a lot of places to see in Hokkaido.
There are frequently earthquakes in Japan.
The students burned their textbooks.
I said it in jest.
I thought that I told you to stay behind.
I'm not ready.
How did she know my name?
I'll be glad to.
I may not have time.
Our team lost all its games.
This is a serious setback.
It's too risky.
He put on an air of innocence.
Thank you, I'd love to have another piece of cake, said the shy young man.
I had my photograph taken.
It has been three months since he left Japan.
I wanted you to have a little fun.
Do you see that house? It's mine.
I am at home.
Tom and Mary came to an understanding.
Did you do your homework by yourself?
It's convenient for me to see you at ten tonight.
I wanted to help you.
Your idea is not entirely crazy.
Please sit down.
Did you sign the contract?
I apologize for my rudeness.
He lives in his car.
I never did that.
He's friendly with everyone in his class.
I'm a big boy now.
You're courageous.
Some of them have committed suicide.
He is not as lazy a student as you think.
When do they need me?
I'd appreciate it if you'd come with me.
Are you pointing at me?
It was last year.
They said you were fired.
I didn't apologize.
What narrow stairs!
I remember seeing you before.
Few students use pencils these days.
We'll drive.
I have a bit of time to relax.
Hey, what's this?
Is this why you've come back?
English is not my mother tongue.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
Classes begin at 8 o'clock.
You're wonderful.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
I rescued you.
Is the Orient too foreign for you?
We were always together.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
Have you known him for a long time?
It's just your imagination.
Do you think you can manage to keep things going until I get back?
Tom has been watching TV all day.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
Am I talented?
I failed the written test.
Merry Christmas!
I want to write a letter.
There's no need to speak so loud.
He wants you to come home.
They have black hair.
My watch has been stolen.
This isn't a hospital.
I know how to drive a car.
Snap out of it!
There are a lot of beautiful songs on these records.
It needs to be repaired.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
He explained it in detail.
Tom has done it enough times.
Thanks for saving my life.
I didn't understand a single word.
Dancing is not a crime.
Can I count on your loyalty?
Can you think of anyone more suitable?
It was really funny.
He has more money than can be spent.
Why are you so hard on yourself?
You look uglier than usual.
Take my hand.
They cut down the tree.
I was just joking.
Rinse with warm water.
Are you tired of living?
Tom looks sick.
Hey, don't do that!
I'll see you in the morning.
She wore glasses.
Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking.
Did you try this key?
Could you do that for me?
We were mesmerized by the pulsating glow of the embers.
I am expecting a letter from her.
I got this as a wedding gift, but I've never used it.
I'll be grateful to you if you can do that for me.
Tom just got dumped.
Were you here last week?
He has a nimble mind.
I think he'll never return.
This price is reasonable.
Tom will pay for what he did.
That's a waste of time and money.
Which is larger, Japan or England?
Take mine.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
Do you want some coffee?
I don't care about any of that.
We must do something.
Tom earns good money.
Can you tell us how that'll work?
I was choked by smoke.
Don't force us to do that.
I'm not sure if that'll help.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
It is safe to skate on this lake.
The dog followed me.
We're going to do it again.
Your prophecy has come true.
Words failed him.
What are you doing with these dolls?
I had a seizure.
Green doesn't go with red.
She can never keep a secret.
I can't answer that yet.
There are a lot of children in the park.
How are you connected?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
I mopped the floor.
Where's my money?
Were you disrespectful?
They worked like bees.
She ordered a cup of tea.
That guy's a friend of mine.
Where's the restroom?
Where's the catch?
I was disappointed.
What are we supposed to do?
You like olives, don't you?
Tom is too young for that.
Don't move till I get back.
I've already rescheduled my appointment twice.
She spent all afternoon cooking.
The plane flew above the clouds.
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
Do you have medical insurance?
I know the song.
I figured I might find you here.
Tom had a rough day.
I always drop in at her house when I go to Tokyo.
Don't raise your voice at me.
Little lights were blinking on and off in the distance.
Birds are flying above the trees.
All people can become friends, even if their languages and customs are different.
How much were you paid to say that?
Tom injured himself when he jumped out of the window.
I do not have the courage to ask my boss to lend me his car.
Why don't we go and see a movie?
Visit us tomorrow.
You're very understanding.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
He will always love her.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
He gave me his office telephone number and address.
I never would've given up.
I am the same age.
I don't know who these people are.
You can't pay too much for good shoes.
He went to New York on business.
I'm right in the middle of doing something.
We met in Boston.
They want to tell you their story.
Do you like dancing?
Are you thirsty?
How's that going for you?
All in all, we had a good time at the party.
I need more.
I'll take good care of Tom.
You have a wonderful voice.
I may have made a mistake.
I took Highway 58.
I know I should've done that.
The police recovered the stolen money.
Tom also has a brother.
Please keep in touch.
I trust the room will be to your satisfaction.
Why would you want to share this type of information with people you hardly know?
I don't believe that anymore.
Did Tom eat?
Why don't you lie down for a while?
Is it Tuesday already?
He has learned to be patient.
Give a tissue to Tom.
Can I turn off the TV?
We must do away with these old rules.
I'm humming.
You should assume that Tom already knows about the problem.
I flunked out of school.
I hit the jackpot.
I'm the second oldest of three children.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
I should've put on some sunscreen.
I just want you to tell me why you lied.
Anybody in here?
Summer doesn't last very long.
Do you really want to talk about that now?
Tom was accused of stealing.
I know you considered me a close friend.
I love your hair.
Do you really believe those stories?
Get me out of here now.
I'm not very patient.
It's not as big a problem as you think.
Do you play any sports?
Tom doesn't have the will power to quit smoking.
Please add my name to the list.
My birthday is coming up.
That's why I came.
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
That is not my line.
Where is the toilet?
Tom wasn't wearing his seat belt.
Just do what I say.
I'm glad that I still live here.
I'll apply for the job today.
Get down from there.
The price of eggs is going up.
What do your children usually eat for breakfast?
Tom said he tried to kiss Mary.
I don't see a problem with that.
It's funny.
I think it's time for me to ask for her help.
It's Tom I want to meet.
Tom heard a loud noise.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
That was only a figure of speech.
We depend on each other.
What happened last night?
I'm undressing.
Why didn't you call me up?
Let's get rid of this.
I like stories that have sad endings.
What's the purpose of your visit?
They relaxed.
They canceled the festival.
You can get a loan from a bank.
If you're not listening to the radio, turn it off.
Our studio is still located on Park Street.
I'm the one who's been lied to.
Is anything missing?
The experiment seemed to be going well.
I suppressed a yawn.
I'm completely wrecked.
She was on verge of fainting.
Quit gambling.
My friend gave me a silk scarf.
How did the railway accident at Tokyo Station happen?
We need to remember to put some gasoline in the car.
You may use his library.
My name was omitted from the list.
Can I use your pencil?
Is this seat vacant?
He arrived very early this morning.
Thanks to all of you.
I want to be the first to do that.
I'll never forget.
You don't have any proof.
Mary is Tom's stepmother.
This chimney is made of brick.
You have to get rid of it.
My cholesterol is high.
You were scared, weren't you?
I have bad breath.
On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers.
I think Tom is a nice name.
Tom finished washing the dishes.
I want to hear anything you have to say.
I thought I'd find you here.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
You're not very funny.
Don't you think I know my own brother?
That doesn't seem very hygienic.
Why don't we just reformat the hard disk? You've been having a lot of trouble with it.
This car won't start.
Since it was already late, I went to sleep.
We're surprised.
Don't eat garbage.
It wasn't a request.
Don't you think it might be a bit too expensive for us to buy?
English is spoken in Canada.
I'm aware of the risks.
I felt strong.
I should've never come here.
Get to bed.
Tom disguised himself as a fireman.
A deal is a deal.
They're mine.
I've got to get home.
Take no chances.
I'm quite serious.
I'll keep it a secret. Don't worry.
Do you know where he went?
Where are you headed?
I noticed that I had grown up when I started following my parents' advice.
The meeting was held here.
I don't have the number.
I showed him the way.
Tom was sure of it.
I figured you might want this.
Are they satisfied?
They arrived at the hotel.
I want to be a teacher.
Things are starting to take shape.
Subtlety never was your strong suit.
I've learned to expect the unexpected.
My camera is different from yours.
Who's that person?
Something wasn't right.
You can't force us to go.
I'm scared to death.
She abandoned her children.
Will you buy me some bread, please?
I did that earlier today.
I love teaching.
The loss amounted to $2,000,000.
Tom had to sleep in the living room on the couch because Mary's dog didn't let him get in his room.
They did what they were told.
I live in Japan.
Tom doesn't have to come tomorrow.
How many of them are there?
You look European.
We will soon take off.
That seems right.
I'd just like to ask Tom one question.
December has thirty-one days.
I've heard a lot about it.
I saw myself in the mirror.
Can you determine what happened?
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
She appears to have many friends.
I will stand by you whatever happens.
This is extortion.
You promised me that you would take care of them.
Where's your car? "In front of the garage."
Is Tom ill?
I ran into my friend.
She has not seen him for a long time.
You're the most important person in my life.
Tom built his own house.
How many concerts did you go to last year?
Where's the rest of my money?
Everyone started clapping.
I don't have any pens.
I see your point.
Japanese tourists can be found everywhere.
There is a solution though.
She didn't want to sell the book.
Take my word for it.
She called him a fool.
Tom will enjoy doing that.
I'll get my revenge.
I think that's the best answer.
He fainted with hunger and fatigue, but came to after a while.
I could really use a change in scenery!
I'm the one who ought to apologize.
She seems rich.
We were all disgusted.
How old are the kids?
The auto industry is hiring again.
We had an earthquake last night.
I wonder what Tom would do.
She testified that she saw the man.
Please don't make me eat that.
According to some scholars, a major earthquake could occur at any moment now.
We're not rich.
That doesn't seem right.
We're still not sure.
He is a student at Yushu High School.
Isn't that Tom's hat?
Tom doesn't keep his promises.
I did it in a hurry.
At present, he is in Canada.
Don't worry. We'll find it.
I get chapped lips every winter.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I knew something was up.
I feel so pretty.
My daughter's name is Mary.
I was stupid enough to believe it.
How about going for a swim?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
I owe you a dinner.
The door could not be opened.
I'm going to Boston for the holidays.
Go and help wash the dishes.
The ice is too thin to skate on.
You're the only one for me now.
Tom is a businessman.
Tom is not available at the moment. May I take a message?
It certainly feels like it's going to rain.
I will go if you go.
I think it's time for me to call a doctor.
Hold it!
She dyed her hair blonde.
We're doing everything we can to find your son.
This color is a bit darker than that one.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
I knew that Tom knew who was going to do that.
He was wearing a threadbare suit.
You may stay here as long as you like.
It's our third day in Boston.
You won't believe who came by today.
Tom has no insurance.
The young man came running to meet her.
Hey, what happened?
The town has changed a lot since then.
I heard Tom is filing for divorce.
You've been there before, haven't you?
Would you please reserve a room near the Toronto international Airport?
I'll be right there.
I love the flowers you sent me.
He sat down by my side.
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
I promised I wasn't going to do this.
No one respects me.
Do you want more milk in your coffee?
There's no need to exaggerate.
That is no business of his.
Where did you sleep last night?
Let's rest a little.
Let me have a try.
I give you everything you ask for, but you never seem satisfied.
How about having a drink after we finish our work today?
I was warned.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
I'd like to talk about it.
Stop bragging.
This job shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
I'm greedy.
Come and get it.
Nobody would listen to me.
He was not a good politician.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
I wish I had more friends.
No one helped me.
I'll be returning to Boston sometime next month.
You need to focus on your strengths.
Tom was heartbroken when his dog died.
Did you know Tom has a son?
They'll tell you the truth.
She was successful in the attempt.
What would you like to talk about?
How tall you are!
I can't believe we're here.
That should make you happy.
Is there something I can get for you?
You're such a flirt.
Was it complicated?
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Ask him for advice.
I do not trust him any longer.
Are you going to do something about it?
Are you lonely?
They're good friends of ours.
I'll call if I hear anything.
That's good to hear.
Really?
We're in trouble.
Choose books carefully.
Tom thought Mary was kidding.
They said no.
There are cookies in the oven.
Tell me how the robbery went down.
I was glad to help.
Could I talk to you for a second?
I'm thrilled to go.
I love this sweater.
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
I could keep it a secret.
It was horrible.
I know Tom can't win.
If I had known that you were here, I would have come at once.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
You know the drill.
I have difficulty concentrating.
We saw the lady carried away to the hospital.
How did that whole thing happen?
He helped an old lady get up from her seat.
Tom isn't accustomed to working at night.
She looks young, but as a matter of fact she is older than you are.
I've read the first page.
It's about to explode!
I wrote a book about China.
Don't make any noise or you'll scare the birds away.
I don't feel comfortable here.
It stinks.
You're winning.
I remember that.
This cat is Tom's.
I made a sandwich for you.
Do you know what he has done?
I figured you might want this.
I see someone.
The allegations they made were unfounded.
I don't own a guitar.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I like your website.
That doesn't work at all.
I thought it'd be fun to sing a few songs together.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
They're here for me.
What would you like to do tomorrow?
I built this for you.
I can't understand this word.
That car dealership has a reputation for selling lemons.
Tom didn't trust Mary.
She is anxious to meet you.
You're not fat.
I'm just helping out.
Do you think you would ever consider suicide?
I like running.
I think I've seen that guy somewhere before.
I began doing that last month.
It is becoming warmer day by day.
That idea is ridiculous.
How do you pronounce this?
Leave a message.
You're good.
She emerged victorious in the struggle.
I like walking.
I almost forgot to tell Tom about the party.
You can't cling to the past.
Could you spare me a few minutes?
What do these markings mean?
Do you have anything to eat in your pack?
He muttered a curse.
I still do that from time to time.
Which credit cards can I use?
I managed to get rid of him.
Stop talking like that.
I think Tom deserves that.
She is getting prettier.
Is there still any sugar?
He has a very expensive watch.
Let's wait a while.
Tom's wounded.
They released Tom.
Could you give me a leg up here?
This whole affair stinks to high heaven.
I had a really great time tonight.
Once a month, I go to the hairdresser.
I can't lie like this anymore.
Are you ambitious?
We must get together for a drink some time.
It was the happiest time of my life.
Do you love your mother?
The work has been almost completed.
She passed the examination.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
Does Tom have a job?
Will you be at home tonight?
You were drunk, weren't you?
We owe part of our success to luck.
Tom didn't know anyone.
Get these people out of here.
We can't exist without water.
They could not get there quickly.
She is doing her homework now.
It happened on Halloween night.
Let me pay my share.
Tom and Mary worked out their problems.
I didn't sleep at all last night.
Tom elbowed me in the ribs.
Tom is a religious fanatic.
Mary curled her hair with a curling iron.
How do you know what color it is?
Stop correcting me.
His explanation is not clear.
I'd like to say a few words.
Tom threatened Mary with a knife.
Tom fired first.
You needn't have taken a taxi.
I know absolutely nothing about that.
Drink some water.
Please give me a cup of tea.
You'd better do as the doctor advised you.
The shower is broken.
I'm going to go out and take a walk.
I was disgusted.
The car raised a cloud of dust.
Anybody hurt?
We should keep every school open and every teacher in his job.
Wires transmit electricity.
I don't mind standing.
Other scientists are debating his theory about the disappearance of dinosaurs.
What is that big building in front of us?
This course teaches basic skills in First Aid.
We can pay.
Did you have any trouble?
Tom said hi.
I don't have a spare shirt.
I'm not busy today.
We think that he's honest.
Nobody would listen to me.
Is there anything that I can do for you?
You don't have to be so nervous.
Writing love letters isn't easy for me.
Can I say this one last time?
It seemed likely.
How many spoonfuls of sugar do you usually put in your tea?
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
Music is a universal language.
I can't go in there.
Tom doesn't know where to go.
What do you feel most proud of?
He will be really pleased.
My children are hungry.
If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some.
This feels like silk.
It rained so hard that we decided to visit him some other time.
Tom will always be here for you.
Tell me you're not serious!
Look at the picture.
Tom certainly won't get my vote.
I have only half as many books as he does.
I like her. She's so beautiful!
I know your older brother quite well.
Tom needs some rest.
You are probably wrong.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
I borrowed the book from this library.
She looked well when I last saw her.
I think something is wrong.
I like your smile.
You'd better go to bed at once.
I'll buy this.
I owe him 50,000 yen.
I don't know who these people are.
I'll kick your butt!
Was anybody here while I was out?
I think I can do better.
We're looking for an apartment with two bedrooms.
You're the leader.
You can bet your boots on that.
Can I finish?
Which one was it?
You're lucky that you have a job.
It's very likely Tom will do that.
She advised him to see the dentist, but he said he didn't have enough time to do so.
It can be fatal.
Let's find Tom before Mary does.
I heard him go out.
I said I liked it.
Tom wasn't expecting this.
He can play tennis better than any other boy in his class.
What have you come up with?
Every playground has its bully.
I have a favor to ask of you.
I don't think we can do it that soon.
If I'd only read the contract more carefully!
Lie still.
He goes to China in May.
Tom thinks he knows how much money Mary makes, but Mary makes quite a bit more than Tom thinks she does.
I know you've been trying to help.
I'm considering resigning.
She made me cookies.
Here's my phone number.
Don't even say that as a joke.
Why did you come here?
They were even more interested in his beautiful wife.
You must meet with him.
Lightning precedes thunder.
I shouldn't have made you that sandwich.
For me, being a doctor isn't a job, it's a calling.
The doctor she visited is famous.
He often tells us we must help one another.
We're lucky to be alive.
Tell me where the wine is.
Do you feel guilty?
I don't like to run.
This novel bores me.
I'll protect her with my life.
The new students entered the hall full of hope.
No one could solve the puzzle.
Do you read me?
Tom asked us to turn down the music.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
He represented his class at the meeting.
Is there a gas station near here?
There are no stupid questions.
How do you know where to go?
Tom is cruel.
The machine was too complicated for us to find out the cause of the trouble.
She invited him in.
I was happy to see him.
I'm not proud of that.
I'll be careful.
I'd like to be alone now.
He never breaks his promises.
Speak when you are spoken to.
The two men were not related.
Don't worry. It's easy.
I study English after dinner.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you did your best.
That boy won't tell me his name.
You'll understand all of this eventually.
America is a country of immigrants.
Do your best and don't worry.
That's quite meaningless.
I know you've got more important things to do.
Are you sad?
We had to call off the game because of rain.
If you only had one more week to live, what would you spend your time doing?
Tough luck!
Maybe we should talk.
I don't have the money to buy a car.
I decided not to go to Europe.
I think this coat should fit you.
He lay face up.
What did it look like?
I bought that car.
I must help these people.
There are still some problems.
I thought we could talk.
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
Where is the toilet?
War began five years later.
You didn't keep your word.
I took it for granted that she had received my letter.
Your saxophone isn't as old as mine.
He refused to give them the information.
Did you like it?
That kind of thing can happen when you're in a hurry.
I was going to visit a friend.
I know where you live.
Meiji was beaten by Keio by a score of three to five.
It's a matter of principle.
It must be hard to do that.
We went to a movie.
Smoking is bad for your health.
May I give you some advice?
I forgot the password.
He's my friend. Do you know him?
Don't fret.
Does anybody know about this?
Is that your mom?
I forgot to tell you when to come.
I hope you're wrong about this.
He is smelling the soup.
How did you manage to do that?
He won many competitions.
Please teach me French.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
Tom doesn't like computers.
Will you be eating here or is this to go?
What does it mean?
You haven't told me your name yet.
Statistics indicate that our living standards have risen.
You don't know where it is, do you?
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
What time are you going on duty?
I know what the three of you want.
She argued with him about money.
If you were able to go camping with us, I think we'd all have fun.
I didn't know that Tom was Mary's son.
Can you tell me about it?
Both of them are very cute.
I didn't know that you cared.
I didn't want to bug you.
The train arrived on time.
We're deluding ourselves.
He is a DJ.
Get on your horse.
I've got a funny feeling about that guy.
Just say yes or no.
Tom probably should've studied harder.
The fire was on the first floor.
He read a book written in English.
I advise you to be punctual.
Maybe there's a better way to do this.
The primary cause of his failure is laziness.
She's five years younger than I am.
I've done it.
How did it feel?
I wish I could travel around the world.
I was surprised by the news this morning.
I don't want you anywhere near the medicine cabinet.
Why are you so tired today?
Wipe your nose.
The patient's in the hospital.
The students like it.
Do you know how to whistle?
He couldn't come because he was sick.
It looks like l've come at a bad time.
I know him by name.
Tom asked Mary why she had done that.
That's what really scares me.
Take off your cap.
Tom arrived late as usual.
Are you sure that it was Tom?
I cannot fix the computer.
So, do you like it?
I thought I would find you there.
I'm exhausted.
I'd like to believe you.
Let's open the window.
How do you think that makes me feel?
You're the one who planted that tree.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
I'll be present.
I come here every Monday.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
It's an ongoing process.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I think Tom is serious.
Don't you read the tabloids?
I ache all over.
I trusted my teacher.
It's not always easy.
They exchanged greetings.
How much does the shirt cost?
She picked up a stone.
Once upon a time, there was a pretty little house way out in the country.
He could read me like an open book.
Where do you get off telling me that?
What is this animal called in Japanese?
How do you plan to get home?
I never saw her again.
May I cut in?
Tom doesn't like the way Mary looks at him.
You must be careful.
Leave me alone.
He is unmarried.
There was no response.
How are you going to handle this?
Mary looks like her mother.
We spent the weekend with friends.
I need water.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
I think it's time for us to come to an agreement.
We eat to live, not live to eat.
I feel giddy.
Tom closed his eyes before he kissed Mary.
Still, the war was not over.
You've been following me, haven't you?
I don't want to shoot you.
This is one of the basic rules.
I'll believe that when I see it.
I'd like to know the reason why.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
What he said made us angry.
You live in my heart.
A girl with blonde hair came to see you.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
Don't call him names.
I don't see what the fuss is about.
I'm here to win.
We're safe here.
It was a problem difficult to solve.
I believe I was wrong.
Would you like to go dancing?
What is it with you, anyway?
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
Tom can't see anything without his glasses.
I've been alone for a long time.
I'm studying French and web design.
Tom put on a coat.
Crying won't solve anything.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
This sentence needs to be checked.
You're not bruised.
He took a taxi in order not to miss the train.
Aren't they Englishmen?
Are your hands clean?
How about sleeping at home?
I think about her a lot.
Stop resisting!
I think we both know why I'm here.
My heart's beating so fast!
I like this room.
I took the medicine.
I'll bring sandwiches.
Let me take a nap.
What is your idea?
Thanks a lot. I appreciate that.
Have you turned in your report?
He has to study hard.
Get out of here.
I don't like working on weekends.
You can't do anything right, can you?
Have you decided on a name for your puppy?
What are some foods you usually eat with your fingers?
If you had taken my advice, you wouldn't be in such trouble.
She stared at me.
They are no more alike than a cow and a canary.
Our school is fifty years old.
You had a long day.
He selected a Christmas gift for her.
I wish it would happen more often.
Everything remains as it was.
Anything you say can be used against you.
Tell me where she lives.
Grab that.
His absence was due to illness.
How many pens does she have?
I have a friend who's a pilot.
You don't seem to want to come with us.
Please write down everything I say.
Do you consider them dangerous?
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
Don't change a thing.
I think it's time for me to take a break.
Try it once again.
Let's do it!
Bring it back when you're done.
Tom is good at telling stories.
From the day after tomorrow on, everything will be completely different.
Friendship is the most precious of all.
I remember seeing him once.
I explained the rule to him.
Could I have a knife and fork, please?
Don't tell anyone.
Tom returns home tomorrow.
They're cold.
They are in class.
I forgot you were listening.
Why do you say one thing, and then go and do another?
Do you have a car?
I wish you'd never been born.
Please stop talking.
Be careful. That knife is sharp.
This happened more than three days ago.
Get on the bus.
Tom and Mary have been drinking.
I'm not desperate.
Almost everything has gotten better.
Tom says he likes teaching French.
It means a lot to me to know that you want me to stay.
I couldn't let you do that.
Germans are said to be hardworking.
Call if you need me.
I used to do that as a kid.
The key was nowhere to be found.
Do you like playing volleyball?
Tom can speak French.
You'll catch the bus if you hurry.
The meeting went pretty well.
I can't place him.
Where do you live?
How big you are!
Only one man survived.
Excuse me, is there a hotel around here?
I'll be the last one to do that.
When will it begin?
I want us to be friends again.
Tom kissed Mary.
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
I was too tired to walk any more.
Slavery is a crime against humanity.
Tom asked Mary to work for him.
She is no longer the cheerful woman she once was.
I remember seeing you last year.
She's wearing a great-looking hat.
When he came to, he was tied to a chair in the basement.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
This is not so fun.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
The celebrations culminated in a spectacular fireworks display.
Did you have a good summer?
She doesn't care how she dresses.
I've packed my suitcases already.
Is your mother at home?
Where did you put my gloves?
He's never been in love before.
I want to know who sent you.
Is the chairman going to resign?
Hurry up, or you'll miss the train.
You need to stay awake.
How come Mary is going on a picnic with him?
When did you go to work?
Kyoto is visited by many tourists.
They're Christians.
He scarcely ever watches TV.
I would like to come and see you.
There are some people who sleep in the daytime and work at night.

She aimed at the target.
That's something I never do after lunch.

In our society, there are both honorable people and swindlers.
I really don't want to be alone tonight.
Honesty isn't always the best policy.
There's a big hole.
You didn't keep your word.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Is this the first time you've eaten Japanese food?
I thought you were injured.
Why are you all laughing?
I know sign language.
She is quite pretty, but looks unhealthy.
The most precious resource we have is time.
I think we need those.
I want that.

I just stubbed my toe.
Don't be crude.
She found a nice tie for me.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
Can I get you something?
You're very timid.
I've made a decision.
Make your choice.
I just wanted to try it once.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
He got lost on his way to the village.
Don't be naive.
Is that your book?
I shouldn't have to put up with this noise.
I love the way you kiss.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I broke my leg.
You didn't let me finish.
None of this is good.
You work harder than anyone here.
As far as I know, such a function doesn't exist.
You look happy today.
Have a cup of tea, won't you?
I barely know anything about you.
That shop has many customers.
At this time, there's no safer place to be than right here.
This door won't open.
This morning I missed the train I usually take.
I told them they shouldn't move.
Keep me apprised of any further developments.
You're far too young to be doing this.
You're not fired.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
We took a walk along the river.
He came to London by way of Siberia.
We're going to do everything we can.

I worked all day yesterday.
The fireman chopped his way through the door.
You can't fight a good fight with such a defeatist attitude.
Has Tom been fired?
You should get some rest.
Tom was unsure what he should do.
Check out these stats.
He is his usual self.
You look European.
That's a fake.
We all strive for success.
The train was about to leave the station.
Half of the world’s population lives in cities.
It was handcrafted.
Make love, not war.
You look like your dad.
You are not a child anymore.
We'd like you to sing some songs.
I took a shortcut.
What's he hiding?
I could never do that.
A girl phoned me.
I don't remember anything.
Don't you dare touch anything.
I'll take in the washing before it rains.
I don't care that Tom doesn't like me.
Are you a ghost?
This movie is politically incorrect.
They lived in Spain for several years.
Why do they want to talk to me?
Where in Turkey do you live?
Is there water on Mars?
Tom told Mary that he didn't like her sense of humor.
I like winter.
The medicine didn't do me any good.
I go to school by bus.
She has few friends.
I'd like for you to leave.
He used his head.
It is starting to look pretty cool.
We are measuring the depth of the river.
You're a child.
I'll see you again this afternoon.
I walked from the station.
You must be very busy these days.
I felt a little stiff.
I need your cooperation.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
I've swept the floor.

May I see you tomorrow?

I'm staying out of it.
There was nobody in the garden.
There's nothing else in the box.

You can't be too careful in situations like this.
Farmers are busy working in the field.
Do you have enough money to buy one?
Don't tell anyone we're doing this.
Do you play any instruments?
This mango is delicious.
Hang on. We'll be right there.
The men's room is on the second floor.
He and I have a near-telepathic understanding of each other. No sooner does one of us say something than the other is already responding.
I want to watch what's on TV right now.
What choice do we have?
It's not worth reading any further.
That noise woke me up.
Even the hard-hearted can be moved to tears.
I can't believe I let you talk me into volunteering.
You're back.
She stared at me.
It's very rude of you to say a thing like that.
It may freeze next week.
Tom is our team leader.
It's getting darker outside now.
I agree with everyone.
You don't look happy.
We're fascinated.
Aren't you dressed yet?
This book is full of errors.
I'm not your friend.
She was aching all over.
They clung together for warmth.
That's an old-fashioned expression.
I want to show you something very special.
Tom knew that there was something in the box, but he didn't know what.
The council agreed on it.
He was sent abroad as a correspondent.
The stock market crash of October 1987 in New York is still vividly remembered.
My father smokes.
This handle will not turn.

Look at the picture at the top of the page.
Release him.
As soon as I have it, I'll forward it to you.
Charge this bill to me.

I don't have a prejudice against foreign workers.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
This classroom is very large.
You need to move on.
You're the only person I know that can't swim.
He was busy getting ready for his journey.
Don't look so suspicious.
He quit school last week.
I didn't even notice you.
He fell asleep during class.
You're no different.
What have they done to you?
We will visit them soon.
I can't deal with this place.
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
He refused to take the bribe.
We're all the same.
Do you want to install this free browser add-on?
I went to the same school as Tom.

He came across this old coin in an antique shop.

Who do you work for?
How are you feeling today?
Call me if anything changes.
Are you working?
He wrote a book while in China.
They have plenty of time.
I think we should do that again.

Is that all of them?

It is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands.
Who makes the decisions here?
There was nothing to see.
He walked with a limp.

Somebody saw you.
Oh, come on.
Not everyone agreed.
The police can't arrest you.
That's what the boss wants.
Are you close to your parents?
I will have graduated from college by the time you come back from America.
Do you like French wines?
My husband and daughter are fast asleep.
What should I do with that?
How could it be?
You seem to have thought of something else.
He's a loose cannon.
He gets up early.
You should thank me.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
I must say I'm flattered.
I feel empowered.
He has just come back.
We understand why.
You can rely on him.
I've caught a cold.
I regret that decision.
I almost never make mistakes.
I know Tom was first.
That's doubtful.
Is this pencil yours?
The dog was sleeping on the mat.
I hope you know the last thing I want to do is go there without your permission.
Have you ever cut your finger with a knife?
Don't ever talk to me again.
Do you also have this in other colors?
Nice timing.

Hurry up, or you'll be late.
This bed is too soft for me.
There's no chance you're getting away.
Why didn't somebody call me?
Watch the rear.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
I don't think Tom can deal with the situation.
Can you tell me why you want to work for us?
My father gave a nice watch to me.
That was quick.
Come downstairs.
You can come if you want to.
That's a bit extreme.
I have an appointment at 2:30.
This is not my ticket.
Are these all the same?
I thought you'd be more helpful.

What are you wearing tonight?
He didn't want to do it.
He supports the Democratic Party.
If I'd only taken your advice!
Is that healthy?
There you are.
Don't talk to me like that.
That is no business of yours.
A girl appeared before me.
I think Tom really enjoyed himself.
Which one of those is yours?
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.

He isn't as energetic as he once was.
He married my cousin.

Who's your date tonight?
I understand your language.
It took us half an hour to set up the tent.
We're joking.
I know that Tom was right.
We haven't had much rain this year.
Let's see what happens.
I wasn't informed.
Are they tall?
It wasn't that big.
This happened prior to receiving your letter.
I'm glad you're here.
You're fearless.
I like fruit such as grapes and peaches.
He lives near the beach.
Did you call anyone else?
Everyone was OK.
I really hope so.

Just a minute.
Don't cut your finger.

This is the dress I made last week.
She advised him to cut down on smoking.
I hear you, but I don't see you.
He's one of a kind.
I did everything for you.
Everyone's laughing.
That wasn't my fault.
She told me which clothes would be good to wear.
Who forced you to do that?
I talked to Tom about what happened.
Tom is not going to be happy about this.
How will this all end?
Familiarity breeds contempt and children.
I was unable to prevent this.
I think Tom will never become famous.
I still don't get it.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
He is running.
You can pour the wine into the glass.
It's started.
She did not listen.
This building is on the verge of collapsing.
You seem really busy.
I don't know where you're going.
I enjoy working here.
Tom told me that he was determined to do that.
I got my bicycle repaired.
I concentrated my attention on the lecture.
Is it your first day at school?
It's only getting bigger.
Why do you want stamps?
You can stay with us for the time being.
Why don't you ever cook?
No matter what you say, I don't think Tom is a nice guy.
It's a nice day.
He seems to have no sense of humor.
Tom has a big mouth.
He treats me as an adult.
Fill in the blanks with suitable words.
We need you.
Please tell me what I should do first.
I saw her again.
I hid myself behind the door.
He has come from Boston.
Nobody came to help me.
Please smile.
You're in danger, Tom.
I look forward to it.
I'm not ugly.
I'm trying to find a lawyer to handle my case.
I've been bitten a few times.
What year were you born?
I am tired of listening to his long speech.
I'll get in touch with you next week.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
Don't you read the tabloids?
Let me think it over for a couple of days.
Can I have another drink now?
That's not the only problem.
He gave me a lecture on drinking.
He can't find his hat.
Not knowing what to say, I remained silent.
Something's strange.
I promise you I'll explain everything later.
Is there a woman in your life?
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
I decided to come to Japan last year.
Who is in the house?
School begins at 8:10 a.m.
Give me a minute.
It's all the rage.
I would like to address two questions.
I knew that he was reading.
Making friends is easy when you're young.
I have something important to tell you.
Yesterday my bicycle was stolen while I was doing some shopping.
I think Tom must be right.
I'm getting undressed.
I did you a favor.
Be ruthless.
The boy feared the dark.
Who's on duty today?
Would you like ice?
I have read sixty pages, while he has read only ten.
I am so exhausted!
Six people applied for the job, but none of them were employed.
Why don't you start by telling us how you feel?
Maybe I should be ashamed.
I can't really remember.
Can we close the door?
Don't get angry.
I hope she's safe.
We had a spell of fine weather last autumn.
What's the matter with you?
I'll try it.
You've got a fever.
Why are you freaking out?
Does he know how you feel?
It would be better if we didn't attend that meeting.
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it.
Just pretend you don't know me.
I'd like my coffee weak.
You're the only person who ever comes to visit me.
Tom won't wait for us.
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
Can you give him first aid?
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
We couldn't have done this without your help.
I'm getting used to eating alone.
I used to take a walk in the morning.
My room is twice as large as yours.
Her speech moved the audience.
Wow!
Tom was found dead in his bed.
It was long.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
Who forced you to do that?
I'm sure it was an accident.
I went to school.
I told you I'm not hungry.
Are you a lawyer?
What you need is a friend.
They were drinking champagne.
I think we should stick to the original plan.
I don't have any rooms for rent.
The prisoner was brought before a judge.
Promise me you'll be careful.
I didn't know he drank so much.
If Tom comes, please give him this book.
He likes jelly.
Once she arrives, we can start.
I didn't understand Tom's explanation.
What are you thinking about?
Are you blackmailing me?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You're the only one who understands me.
It is not the correct solution.
He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
Here comes Tom.
This is your hat, isn't it?
Do you want to play hide and seek?
That's all I remember.
You should have been more careful.
Is this ball yours or hers?
He lived in a town near by.
We'll decide by voting.
She's divorced.
I thought it was hilarious.
The new building is enormous.
He kept the invaders at bay with a machine gun.
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!
Why are we still talking about this?
You look so beautiful.
I guess I don't understand what you're trying to say.
You've suffered enough.
Share your lunch with your brother.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
He gave me his stamp of approval.
I refrain from drinking.
He liked that.
You recovered quickly.
That love affair is a family secret.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
I want you and me to be happy.
How was your day?
Call me if you need help.
Ten prisoners broke out of jail.
I've decided never to vote again.
I met Tom at the library.
Don't open your book.
You should never have done that.
How are you going to solve this problem?
I was good.
Tom deserves much better.
You're safe now.
What's done is done.
She gave him money as well as food.
I just don't want you to get upset.
I fell.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Where's Mary's ring?
I need a box about this big.
Am I getting sloppy or what?
He was great.
I wish I could go back in time.
You're not bruised.
Tom isn't wearing a red tie.
I've come a long way.
That sounds reasonable.
He received a large sum of money in compensation for his injury.
I'd rather stay at home than go fishing.
I guess I shouldn't have done that.
Tom and I couldn't agree on what we needed to do.
Scotland is famous for its woollen textiles.
Tom drank the whole bottle of wine by himself.
Have you ever donated blood?
What foreign languages have you studied?
You're not very good.
My boss is very strict.
I was ashamed of what I had done to my benefactor.
I have a lot of money.
She has gone, but I still love her.
I think that you're mistaken.
He wrapped his arms around me.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
I'm happy that you were able to find a job so quickly.
Eating fast food is bad for your health.
We should've tried harder.
I am bored out of my mind.
Tom is a very gentle person.
I want to check it out.
Can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant?
I'm not sure what's wrong. We should have heard from him by now.
Does that mean you bought it?
Almost everyone participated.
Who allowed him in?
May I ask you a personal question?
Sorry, I didn't know you were still here.
It was my first night among strangers.
Get my rifle.
In judging his work, we must take his lack of experience into account.
I'm not allowed to help you.
I've been looking for them for more than one hour.
I don't know how to talk to kids.
The girl lifted the heavy box with one hand.
You have to keep fit.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
It may be the last time.
I need a long nap.
I like that one better.
We're not yet there.
This is going too far.
You don't seem so smart.
I wish I could do that, but I can't.
Don't stop him.
He got a broken jaw and lost some teeth.
I remember everything you tell me.
I made it myself.
This is incredible.
A man came to visit you last night.
What do you want me to do?
I'm at work now, so I'll call you later.
I'll do that immediately.
It's a necessary piece of equipment.
I don't know how, but you did it.
He's afraid of dogs.
Where exactly did you go?
Do it this way.
She's been having trouble with back pain for years.
I can't believe you're trying to bribe me.
He's good at telling jokes.
I knew my time would come.
It's the largest in the world.
I don't know anything about their relationship.
I oppose it.
I don't know where I'll be living next year.
They're all liars.
What should I do to save time?
You should not keep people waiting.
He's the one I called.
I'm usually pretty good with faces, but I didn't recognize him at all.
I come from Saitama.
Have you eaten anywhere interesting lately?
Don't be upset.
I still do that.
What are you looking for?
Do you know when they will arrive? "At eleven-thirty this evening."
I know that you're tired.
Do you eat three square meals a day?
I want to know who sent you.
Tom dyed his hair black.
Be fair.
Can you look at me?
That student raised his hand to ask a question.
Do you really think it's bad?
You're doing the right thing.
I can't stand that noise any longer.
I have to go even if it rains.
Let's go before I change my mind.
What will you have to do? asked her friend.
Do you think that my way of teaching is wrong?
The provisions ran out after a short time.
Just give me some time. I'm sure I can figure out how to solve the problem.
I knew Tom was a busy man.
Do you want me to make coffee?
She leaves for New York next Sunday.
She turned away and began to cry.
Teenage boys love playing video games.
I won't be late.
I am very grateful to you for your advice.
Did you know that?
I just had this suit cleaned.
The old man sat all alone.
There is a dragonfly on the ceiling.
I would like for him to write more often.
This guy is great.
Can I get a refund?
She made me so angry on the telephone that I hung up on her.
They trusted you.
I've got a bad memory for names.
Why shouldn't I sing this song?
All you have to do is sign your name here.
Make a list.
This chair is ugly.
Are you afraid of something?
Can you remember the first word you learned in English?
I thought you quit drinking.
When did you notice that?
No words can relieve her deep sorrow.
It's extremely dangerous.
Do you want another one of these?
How can I get to the stadium?
You'll find out soon enough.
Rome has a lot of ancient buildings.
I can smell the ocean.
Please put some candles on the birthday cake.
Can I use your phone for a sec?
I don't think he is sincere.
I want to ask you some questions.
What are the causes?
Give me five days.
Who're you looking for?
I plan to go to France next year.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
Be careful with that thing.
I really do hope that you'll do that without complaining.
He is my brother.
No one moved.
I'm not worried about him.
We don't have any money.
There are many wild animals around here.
Here's a big map of Germany.
I have lots of Canadian friends.
How about tonight?
It belongs to Tom.
I'm a singer.
I just got fired.
She divided the cake into five pieces.
Is all this money yours?
She burst into tears.
I don't know where I'm going.
You were hoping to win, weren't you?
He was standing there with a vacant look.
Let's take a coffee break.
Tell me what your problem is.
When can you start?
The job is almost finished.
These shelves cannot support so many books.
He'll lend you his book.
Tom said he needed our help.
Do I look like an actress?
Tom and Mary are asleep.
That's not why.
I forgave you a long time ago.
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
You promised me that you would help.
Don't overdo it.
There's a lot to do.
He seldom comes to see me.
Your pronunciation is excellent.
He warned us not to enter the room.
Cats were domesticated by the Egyptians.
It is wrong to tell lies.
That was Tom's cousin.
Tom wants to buy a bass guitar, but he doesn't have enough money.
There was nothing there.
I'm quite certain I don't want to be married to you.
These apples are big.
I cannot put up with this noise.
I left you a note.
The police lowered their weapons.
By the way, how old are you?
Thanks very much.
I like turtles.
He laughed at me.
I'm a little dizzy.
The cause of the fire is not known.
Don't mind her.
We can't do this without some help.
Are you on your way home?
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
He was finally forced to resign.
I've given Tom something to eat.
I will translate.
We can't save everyone.
I am already forgetting my grandmother's face.
Something happened.
This key doesn't fit in the lock.
Should I close?
I forced him to carry the suitcase.
Are you available?
Is eating organic food worth the money?
I just don't want to go with you.
I saw Tom earlier.
I teach French to young children.
Tom's mad.
He ran so he would get there on time.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
Change your mind, if you want to.
How was work today?
I can be there in an hour.
He participated in the debate.
You've already explained that.
She looks very much afraid.
This is where the accident happened.
She's not a bad girl.
Are you listening to me?
I would advise against it.
You can do it.
Come quickly!
Hands off.
Nobody came.
Tom seemed very excited.
Let me stop here.
Do you know anyone who hums while they work?
Get out of here quickly!
She went to the station to see him off.
I'll never speak to you again.
Did you really warn Tom?
Why do people go to the movies?
He looks young considering his age.
It's a brain-teaser.
Did you agree to do it?
My wallet and passport are missing.
She used to go to the museum on Sundays.
Your speech will be recorded in history.
Don't forget to drink plenty of water.
This is an express train. It won't make many stops.
This was my idea.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
She heard him cry.
Will you show me the picture?
Did you enjoy yourself?
Don't you get bored when you're alone?
Am I reinstated?
His laziness is a bad sign for the future.
I think they're lying.
Our guests are arriving.
I really can't figure it out.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
Tom says you've never been to Boston.
Wisdom comes with age.
I admit there are a few problems.
I never thought about it that way.
You are more stupid than I thought.
Tom spoke to Mary.
He hasn't arrived yet.
We all agreed.
He looks like a bug.
If I were you, I'd follow his advice.
I am very interested in music.
Everyone agreed with my decision.
Tom seems to be hyperventilating.
He is very stingy with his money.
He was already regretting it.
Are you really not going?
I have a feeling that she will come today.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my wife?
I will return to Australia the day after tomorrow.
I had a good reason to do that.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
Enjoy your weekend.
Don't be crazy.
I need a partner.
He is trying hard to give up smoking.
Tom's alone.
We'll continue this discussion later.
Go to your room now!
I don't have the right equipment.
Tom saw Mary break the window.
We have another decision to make.
Leave the book where it was.
I've been waiting for the bus for three hours.
What's your favorite sport?
I'd like to see you in my office.
Her job was to see the children safely across the street.
If you don't know the answers, guess.
It's the next logical step.
What other option is there?
She was cleaning the house in preparation for a party.
Everyone knows that I don't like Tom.
I was born here.
I bought a new camera.
We're too late.
Was he home alone?
They all deserve to die.
You can't make everyone happy.
The pleasure is mine.
What's the last thing that you remember?
I actually had fun tonight.
I'm a salesman for our company.
Let's go to a movie.
Do you have a better idea?
I know how you feel.
I can't stand being laughed at in front of others.
I need to meet your boss.
He has a passive character.
Help us, please.
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
Sometimes I wish I had a different religion.
You're powerful.
The kitten lapped up the milk I poured into the saucer.
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
How about taking up jogging?
Would you mind speaking more slowly?
I've given this a lot of thought.
Glass is breakable.
Who did you learn it from?
Tom pulled out his gun.
I guess I could give it a try.
You get what you pay for.
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
I got up early enough to catch the first train.
Are you suggesting that we impersonate policemen?
I promise you I won't do it again.
I forgot my jacket.
They arrived at the foot of the mountain.
They have plenty of money.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle.
I listen to jazz sometimes.
You can't intimidate us.
Both of them started laughing.
I hate this town.
How many times a day do you feed your dog?
I didn't need to paint the fence.
I'm not mean.
He is telling a lie.
Nobody heard the bell ring.
Where's the nearest museum?
I've enjoyed talking to you.
I have a gift for you.
I'm so glad I did this.
They can't fire you.
Something is wrong with the engine.
I said this a long time ago.
She suggested that I take him to the zoo.
If you do not have this book, you can buy it.
It's right in front of your eyes.
Your privacy is important to us.
You've run out of time.
The catapult hurled the boulder over the castle walls.
How old is Tom?
It is made partly of wood.
You need to study harder.
Choose the color you like the best.
Why don't we all run?
How is your job search going?
Can I speak to the head nurse?
I wanted to come.
I do not like music.
I can come tomorrow.
This is a book.
He asked me some questions about the math test.
Women are all the same.
Tom was that kind of person.
I had no time to eat.
You should be a writer.
You need to save the princess.
Did I break it?
This carbon fiber bicycle is incredibly lightweight.
You're fearless.
The dog went away.
We have a theory.
Take a look at this map.
Have you ever seen Tom's mother?
He came out of the room.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I miss hanging out there.
Boys are stupid.
You're being paranoid.
I want each of you to take out a piece of paper and write down what happened.
I can't kiss you now.
I would never do it again.
Who called the cops?
Did you have a nice evening?
All the goods for sale are set out on the tables.
I'm sick of this war.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
Where is my dog?
I also went there.
We painted the house green.
We're up a creek without a paddle.
Take me home.
Don't tell me you didn't see it.
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
She never lies.
Do you have any children you haven't told me about?
We ran short of money.
He proved to be an ideal husband.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
We're all retired.
You're so mean.
I think it's time to go home.
It's not good to read in a dark room.
It was a waste of time.
Will it rain tomorrow?
It's unusual for him to get up early.
Wash your feet.
Tom didn't get a chance to thank Mary for all her help.
Did you listen to music last night?
I'm not inspired anymore.
I was beaten.
Keep to the right.
I paid for these tickets.
How many of your students are here?
I just couldn't do it anymore.
I hope you like spicy food.
I want you to grow up.
Tom raises racing pigeons.
We enjoy talking.
Tom always walks to school when it isn't raining.
What he did is very wrong.
I don't like Tom and I don't trust him.
There's another meaning, too.
That's probably going to fall.
She cut the cake in two.
You made me proud.
It was not easy for us to find his house.
Tom wanted to play chess.
There is a cafeteria in the university.
Just seeing it made me nervous.
How tall are you, and how much do you weigh?
Tom is a teenager.
How are you all doing?
Tom found the necklace Mary had lost.
That's what she said.
Neither of those boys can speak French.
Your face is red.
I can't believe you fell for that.
You're big.
We stayed with them all through the summer.
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
I'd like to handle this in my own way.
I'm still married.
Would you mind helping me with something?
The letter was addressed to me.
How are you connected?
We don't have enough time to burn all these documents before the police arrive.
We lost.
I have no secrets from you.
I saw a big pelican there.
What did you think of him?
I have to take some money out of the bank.
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
Why do I have to go to school?
They entertained us at dinner last night.
This room has three windows.
Take one of these.
Mary is expecting a baby in October.
I am a student at Oxford University.
He left his keys in the car.
He has been living in Ankara for six years.
I didn't hear you come in.
He saw it also.
Help me and I'll help you.
He speaks English fluently.
I don't know who my mother is.
It's one of our rules.
I'm game.
I want you to get off my back.
I had to pay 5 dollars in addition.
They abandoned their country.
Please read that book.
I like sashimi.
I caught up on all my homework last night.
You played tennis yesterday.
We shouldn't do anything about that right now.
Have we met?
His nose is bleeding.
Whatever she says is true.
He congratulated me on my success.
She looked up at the sky.
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was younger.
I will never forgive you.
Tom hesitated.
I want you to stay on the beach.
Let me write down the steps for you.
Why don't you run for student council?
I'm sure.
The dog followed its master, wagging its tail.
Tom is outside watering the flowers.
Tom wiped the glass with a dishcloth.
The computer is in the library.
Tom hates Halloween.
I deserve better than this.
Are you speaking to me?
Can you account for all the money you spent?
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
If you're going to start a new business, you need a business plan.
If for some reason a man stopped thinking, that man would no longer be a man.
We have no further details at this time.
I'm feeling stressed.
I don't like it either.
That person is like me.
Please come here between two and three this afternoon.
Is your room clean?
I'm going to do some reading.
Doing that will be hard.
I don't have much time now.
In any case, I must finish this work by tomorrow.
Words could not describe it.
Can you carve the chicken?
They don't care.
I figured you might want a drink.
Get back in the house.
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.
Would you excuse us one moment?
Even after twelve months, Tom can't accept that it's over between him and Mary.
Tie your shoe.
I go to the barber's once a month.
What did you do then?
I was forced to take medicine.
What I did was wrong.
I assume you don't want this.
I sure hope there's nothing wrong with it.
Are you picking on me?
Were you shot at?
Are you the owner of this house?
We heard the boy playing the violin.
My neighbor went crazy.
I caused this.
Close the door, please.
He happened to be there.
Meet me in the hot tub.
Anything the group decides is OK is fine with me.
All of us looked through the window.
Check out what I've been up to.
She is a pianist.
Half of these are Tom's.
I think it's going well.
That pretty bird did nothing but sing day after day.
I want to see how it ends.
He leveled his gun at me.
The cost of living has increased drastically.
If you get your right ear pierced, that means you're gay.
Tom is rude.
I've got somebody with me.
He's a bigot.
I wonder whether or not Tom is alive.
Telephone him if the message is important.
All those books are mine.
What is it this time?
If you pass this test, you could graduate next month.
Do you want me to believe that?
Do you think it was easy for me?
Everyone's eyes were fixed on the screens.
He changed his mind.
Don't rely on others.
Show us around.
Don't make me change that policy.
Where's your weapon?
It doesn't matter if you do that or not.
I remember seeing you all somewhere.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
Tom put on his backpack.
I'll take your suitcase to your room, sir.
I'm unmarried.
I think she is withholding information from the police.
You are beautiful.
Something fishy is going on.
Tom's not a nice guy.
Tom could make you laugh.
The rules apply to everyone.
I think everybody's hungry.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Can the meeting be finished within two hours?
It looks painful.
There are some flies on the wall.
While waiting for bus, I was caught in a shower.
We've all been there.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
Karima hasn't read the letter yet.
I think that's kind of dishonest.
She was advised by him to get more exercise.
I'm not a gambler.
Did I break it?
Why do you ask?
I think I might join you, but I haven't decided yet.
I usually only eat fruit for breakfast.
I should get some rest.
I refuse to believe that we can't do anything about the situation.
If only I had a pretty dress like that!
He went fishing instead of playing tennis.
You were bluffing, weren't you?
She told him that it would rain all day.
He heard a shout.
I told her that if I could be of any use I would be glad to help.
Is that your car?
I want some orange juice.
Whether you like it or not, you have to do your homework.
Just use mine for now.
I had met her many times before then.
I got really hungry.
This is the last place I want to be right now.
I will not be busy tomorrow.
Don't leave me.
He promised not to smoke.
I don't know how much money we've got.
It's not enough.
I'm just watching television.
I don't watch TV very much.
I want an answer from you as soon as possible.
Why are you angry?
Tom is a doctor.
Quit acting like a baby.
I feel a little better now.
I arrived ahead of the others.
Of all these books, this is by far the best on China.
Is anything wrong?
They abandoned the plan.
When I was strolling along the beach this morning, I found this bottle.
Should I wait for you here?
Just then, the telephone rang.
I think Tom had a real good year.
There is a strong bond of affection between them.
I like playing basketball.
No one speaks with me.
That isn't Tom's suitcase.
Here's a yellow rose.
I wish I could paint like that.
Iceland belonged to Denmark.
My meals are prepared by my mother.
I share a room with Tom.
People should be the masters of their own destinies.
How do you know how deep the lake is?
I am terribly busy because the report deadline is near.
Can you wait until 2:30 this afternoon?
I'm meeting someone for dinner.
Better to err on the side of caution.
Can't you see I'm busy?
I remember many things.
He is a tough cookie.
Do you have any idea what that is?
Not much time is required.
Did you sleep in here?
We now know Tom was lying.
What cold drinks do you have?
We'll try to get there as soon as possible.
I'd like to take a walk.
Tom'll call.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
China is the largest country in Asia.
My sister is crazy about tennis.
That isn't a cat.
Are you sure that Tom is here?
Do you have any money on you?
Are you an only child?
He doesn't know me.
I suppose it might work.
Are these bananas ripe?
We're not sure what's going on.
The arrow hit the target.
You need to smile more.
Let's see what the outcome is.
I didn't look at my feet.
I accepted the challenge.
What time did you wake up?
I wouldn't have made it without you.
You may give the book to whoever wants it.
I missed the competition.
I don't eat meat as often as I used to.
She seems to have something to do with the affair.
I'm not certain we can get tickets tonight.
Tom and Mary sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
You can't just leave us here with no food and water.
It may rain.
I thought that you wanted to go with us.
The farmer caught the boy stealing the apples in his orchard.
You're creepy.
Did I give you that impression?
A crowd collected to watch the fight.

We're going to have to verify this.
He whittled the stick to a sharp point with his hunting knife.
Does anyone have any other questions?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
May I take a shower in the morning?
Tom says you've never been to Boston.
You did your best.
Tom always works hard.
Everyone waited.
He resented everyone's being very quiet.
Where are the other girls?
You've come too early.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't walk alone after dark.
That almost made me laugh.

Sorry, but that's not what I ordered.
You seem a little depressed today.
When did your father come home?
We need to move ahead.
My mother took me to the park.
If I were you, I would ignore it.
I do not want to reply to his letter.
My right shoulder hurts.
We met in Europe a few years ago.
You have to be home by nine o'clock.
Tom had reasons to be angry.
I want to keep my kids safe.
Tom is usually not very reliable.
I can't live that kind of life.
Where are you calling from?
Death is an integral part of life.
Let's quit talking about this.
I'm too short to reach the top shelf.
Don't make this decision today.
You don't want to know.
It is twenty minutes past ten.
Don't forget that.
The police say they know you had an accomplice.
Did you vote?
He gave me all his money.
You can do whatever you like.
You're not being rational.
I love summer.
Her father is tall.
You can depend on it.
Let's try to solve the riddle.
Go on, Tom, I'm listening.
Where have you been all this time?
She lives next door to him.
I have gotten him into trouble.
Some water, please.
I play golf every so often.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
Personal computers are very useful.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
You've got to answer the question.
I woke up at five this morning.
I'm rich.
Save Tom.
How's the water?
Of course!
My mother was in the hospital during the summer.
You may quote me.
Don't worry. I have insurance.
Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him why I did that.
Tom doesn't appear to be paying attention.
I'll lend you my textbook if you promise not to write anything in it.
Everything about this is wrong.
I planned to introduce him to her.
I persuaded him into accepting the offer.
I am short of money.
We'd be happy if you could come with us.
It's about time you were independent of your parents.
It's not too late to walk away.

It's OK to take a picture from outside.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
I'm not certain.
He is no longer welcome here.
You have to judge the case without bias.
Everybody makes mistakes, don't they?
He made his will last year.
I am totally confused.
I wash my hair every day.
I can't believe you just said that.
Of course, you're correct.
That is the picture that he painted.
If I were you, I'd follow his advice.
I never stay anywhere long enough to make friends.
I asked him not to bother me.
No one wants to talk about books anymore.
Turn down the radio.
Just answer the question.
Who do you want to talk to?
Tom refused to talk.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
The law is pretty clear.
Do you go to school by bus?
The weather stayed bad.
Don't let the dog sleep in our bed.
I know Tom can do that today.
I wish I were in Paris now.
I never agree with him.
As soon as she heard the bell ring, she answered the telephone.
Tom wants to play.
This ball is that boy's treasure.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Can we prove it?
He's missed the boat.
I know how busy you've been.
Take a closer look.
You don't sound entirely convinced.

She cremated him within 24 hours of his death.
I will choose one of them.
The sun isn't up yet.
Have you ever been to Boston?
I think it'll freeze tonight.
We must fix this.
Did you kill anybody?
Tom's not a bad guy.
Tom was absent from school last Monday.
Tom has done other stupid things.
The ring was not to be found anywhere.
I'm visiting a friend of mine in the hospital.
I lost my shoe in the fire.
This is my brother's.
I don't usually eat red meat.
I'll never forget shaking the President's hand last year.
Tom never lets anyone do anything.
What a strange story!
She glanced shyly at the young man.
I feel kind of hungry.
I have many discs.
You don't need to hurry. Take your time.
It's inevitable.
Is it true that you can't swim?
I've got to do my chores.
The young man put out his hand and I shook it.
I'm allowing you to go.
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella.

I guess I felt like eating something different.
You obviously don't live here.
Give your passport number and your date of birth.
This is my final offer.
The trees were full of birds.
I have plenty of time, but not enough money.
Have you finished knitting that sweater?
Tom wanted to be like John.
Don't worry about things that aren't important.
Life isn't fair, is it?
What exactly did you do?
I don't intend to go anywhere today.
I'm sorry. I'm partly responsible for it.
The boy talks as if he were a man.
Where do you think I met her?
You must be very proud of your son.
I don't have my glasses.
I don't want to go to sleep right now.
Just a minute.
Our garden has two cherry trees.
We enjoyed skating.
I love the smell of pancakes in the morning.
I made him change his plan.
They're enjoying themselves.
She wants to be a designer.
That's imitation leather.
This beer is for you.
May I come in?
Tom extinguished the fire.
Let's do our job.

Who's going to pay the mechanic?
I like the sound of the piano.
Something seems to be wrong with my clock.
I liked that.
We saw a bird in the distance.
Can you forgive me?
Don't watch too much TV.
How many different schools have you attended?
You're turning red.

You're a mean person.
Tom got out of prison after 30 years.

You look so pale.
When did you see her dancing with him?
I hear you're moving out.
That's just wishful thinking.
I'm sure Tom will get mad.
I think I like eating white rice better than brown rice.
God knows we did everything we could.

You probably just want to be alone.
We're really good.

I thought I was being smart.
I asked Tom if I could use his computer.
Tom went to high school with me.

Stay away from that.

That doesn't help very much.
We all laughed.
I'm being held hostage.
I don't have time to explain it now.
Tom didn't find anything.
A number of passengers were injured.
You're stubborn.
I want you to talk to me.
It will go away by itself in two weeks.
I tried to do that once.
I liked your friends.
She was injured in a fall.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
She asked him if he was happy.
It's up to you and me.
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
There is not much possibility of his coming on time.
Is Tom around?
Were you expecting something different?
She talks about Paris as if she had been there many times.
I wasn't at home last night.
Hands up! This is a robbery.
Stay away from the door.
Could you leave me one?
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
The soldiers filled the sandbags with sand.
Isn't that better?
You're amazing.
I'm not your enemy.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Will you lend me your CD player for an hour?
I'm not even sure I want to see that movie.
You can take whatever you like.
His parents loved me.
I didn't want you to get involved.
That's why he got angry.
Generally speaking, men are taller than women.
Does the hat fit well?
What language do you speak?
You have no heart.
We are very similar.
How did you learn to cook so well?
It is not too much to say that he is a genius.
I'd like to go with you if you don't mind.
Do you remember?
Do you really think Tom will help us?
I've been looking for a girl like you.
We should decide today.
I can't figure out how to upload an image.
Tom's good at his job.
You should have woken me up.
What are you all doing?
Tom asked for my number.
His name is very difficult to remember.
Will you show me your album?
Do you want another glass of wine?
He's lazy.
There'll come a day when you'll regret it.
Your house needs painting.
You're not one of them, are you?
We nearly starved.
He's looking at you.
What have you done this week?
I could've gone last week.
Please don't be mad at me.
I remember this word.
I'm not going out tonight.
It seems that the only time he isn't eating is when he's sleeping.
I have Tom's keys.
I told you this was going to be boring.
Please phone him.
You're too slow.
Since it was cold, we made a fire.
The policeman said that it looked like a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
We're waiting.
I'm too tired to think.
I hope Tom feels better today.
Do you have any idea where Tom went?
Someone has brought us some grapes.
I still don't believe I won.
What if someone killed Tom? What would you do?
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
You must study your whole life.
It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
He began to look for work.
The suspect was holed up in an abandoned factory.
The train approached the town.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
Don't light the candle.
Where did you learn all that?
I love that store.
Tell me when you want me to come.
Do you have a search warrant?
I would complain.
What's your favorite band?
I just want answers.
Tell me if there's anything I can do to help.
Stay still.
The man took the boy by the hand.
Is it too small?
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
I love my daughter.
Why are you telling me this now?
Let me pay my share.
Tom is accustomed to long flights.
What are you up to?
Do you live in this neighborhood?
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
I may have something for you.
He is giving me a hard time.
Tom doesn't speak French, does he?
Tom found me a French teacher.
That's not very good, is it?
He seldom goes to church.
That'll be a lot of fun.
Don't cast pearls before swine.
Illness prevented me from going to the party.
Tom'll pay.
Can you speak French?
It happened while I wasn't looking.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
Did you have fun tonight?
We're the same.
He's an aristocrat.
I got that from Tom.
I'd like to discuss some problems we've been having.
I want to focus on the future.
It's right above you.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
Won't you take a chair?
This is where the magic happens.
Tom will cry.
These are just routine questions we ask everyone.
Tom isn't very funny.
Do you approve of what he is doing?
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
Who's Tom's mother?
She turned against her old friend.
That's how he invented the machine.
You are always complaining.
If he hadn't wasted time, he'd be finished by now.
I thought Tom was Canadian.
Don't be so careless!
Tom bought a book.
Now that you're my girlfriend, I'm happy.
You have friends who can help you, don't you?
Can I use your phone?
I'm sure Tom intended to do that.
She decided not to go.
I can't believe I cried.
This box is light.
Would you mind if I went home early?
I really miss my girlfriend.
They were very kind to me.
We've been warned.
Whatever happened to your pride?
You shouldn't have done that.
I can't pay all my bills this month.
I don't like your smile.
Can you break a 1,000 yen bill?
What did Tom want us to do?
They're mad at you.
Are you still thirsty?
I'm already retired.
I had to work.
We overslept.
Boats can sink.
You need to stop.
You can do that tomorrow.
They clung together for warmth.
I thought you might want a drink.
I couldn't think of anything worse.
There are many beautiful parks in London.
I should congratulate you.
Tom has an older brother named John.
This is what I want.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Give it a shot.
Do we have time for another cup of coffee?
What's the horse's name?
Whoever told you that is a liar.
Do you really think you can do that?
He told me the story of his life.
I thought they'd heard us.
He bores everybody.
Remember what Tom told us.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
Who is it that you're working for?
He became a national hero.
He is sure to pass the exam.
My knife is sharp.
Tom is now in custody.
Is this your bike?
The concert was incredible.
My cousin is having a baby next month.
He had ambition.
Your lips are blue.
She taught us singing.
Would it help me?
The vast majority of children love ice cream.
There were 30 survivors.
Have you finished your homework yet?
Let me tell you something about Boston.
The Hilton Hotel, please.
She doesn't understand you.
Never tell a lie again.
What's the forecast for tomorrow?
That's all I was interested in.
You should've taken his advice.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
We're powerless.
Where's the nearest bus stop?
I just went home without saying anything.
I was patient.
I was at home.
Lock the doors.
He has been waiting here some time.
Have you ever been arrested?
That's alright.
She knows more than she's letting on.
You need to be more careful from now on.
I prefer not to discuss it here.
You are bound to fail unless you study harder.
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
The president made a statement on the issue.
Please copy this page.
I think it's very impressive.
Have something to eat.
She didn't say a word to me all night.
I ask your forgiveness.
Tom is a good teacher, isn't he?
I'm sick of fighting.
Tom doesn't even have a pencil.
The weather was gorgeous.
There are some police cars parked outside.
Why don't you run along?
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.
I was too surprised to speak.
Didn't it ever occur to them that they would be punished?
I ate something earlier this evening that didn't agree with me.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
The police accused her of texting while driving.
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
A relationship based on total honesty is bound to fail.
I don't think I want to be here.
Tom has an iPhone.
If you could do it, would you?
I had no place to go.
The tree stopped growing.
We need to water the flowers.
Don't make fun of old people.
I lit the match.
The cows are eating grass.
I bowed politely.
Where did he find the money?
Sawako wants to go to France.
He was very tall, so I recognized him at once.
You didn't have to wake me up.
Tom made plans.
Can you believe it?
How much time did you spend doing research before you started writing?
She couldn't convince him to go home.
He speaks really well.
He is a lazy student.
Are you about done?
Is that why you're upset?
Tom is your friend.
Here, have a drink.
You're productive.
We're all different.
Tom stole the show.
Tom does nothing but read comics.
I feel the same way about it as you do.
This is how I solved the problem.
There is a park in the middle of the city.
Bring it back when you're done.
You must learn to adapt.
The door was already open.
Did you try restarting the computer?
You have a bright future.
You're tough.
Tom decided to become a cook.
Ask her what she bought.
You know who I'm talking about, right?
This approach has worked before.
I always walk to school.
The ice was thick enough to walk on.
I thought you did fairly well.
They were very confused.
Tom has a house in Boston.
She cried as she read the letter.
Tom is trying to make sure that everything is ready.
I thought this was mine.
If you testify against him, we can put him behind bars for good.
You are such a sweetheart.
In Haiti, there was a large earthquake.
He is ahead of his class in English.
How many plates do you want?
I don't know who's involved.
The poor acoustics in the hall severely affected the audience's enjoyment of the concert.
What is wrong with that guy?
Tom doesn't remember turning off the light.
You don't look Japanese.
This nation's economy is growing by leaps and bounds in recent years.
I went into details.
You look fine.
Of the two girls, she is the younger.
I'll pay my own way.
You don't have to tell me this.
You're not supposed to be in here.
Money doesn't necessarily make you happier.
Thank you all for your attention.
The girl trembled with fear.
Grandpa always said there'd be days like this.
You have to do it today.
I don't know any more than you do.
I will never change my mind.
What makes you ask that?
Quick, give me that.
I can't carry on like this.
She's worried about your safety.
That never even crossed my mind.
She took my hand.
How could you not give me the message?
He's still sick in bed.
Can you eat raw oysters?
I was here when you came in.
Please don't enter the room without knocking.
He'll wait for us to call him.
Is it difficult to learn French?
He has gone mad.
Tom isn't wearing a new hat.
I was told that it's dangerous to swim here.
I feel sorry for you.
Who sent you?
Do you know who you’re talking to?
I refuse to be taken in by her guile.
She heard him cry in the middle of the night.
Are you a natural blonde?
Tom is a 33-year-old man.
My house has a small yard.
One thing I've always wanted to do is write a children's book.
Tom isn't conservative.
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
The conference ended at five.
I prefer it that way.
Why are you speaking so loudly?
What a relief!
How are you connected?
Tom plucked the chicken.
He bragged about it.
We are staying at our uncle's.
He whistled for his dog.
I have to tell someone.
What part is wrong?
That's the way he likes it.
What makes you think I'm not happy?
He pushed the cat into the swimming pool.
I'm one of your students.
She is often late for school on Mondays.
I think I'll stay at home.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
I need a snack.
Don't you get bored when you're alone?
What were you doing when I called this morning?
I'm glad you called.
Can Tom read and write Japanese?
We celebrated Mother's 45th birthday.
You can't both be right.
It's neat and clean.
I lied about that.
He can't drive.
He hates spiders.
I don't like the taste of this.
Where do you know each other from?
I have the ace of clubs.
It's not at all rare to live to be over ninety years old.
It struck me that the girl was trying to hide something.
You don't deserve to live.
I was not aware of a mosquito biting my arm.
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow.
Somebody poisoned Tom.
He asked me to.
You could be a little nicer to your brother.
We chose this one.
I can't understand what they were thinking.
I don't like what he said.
I saw Tom a minute ago.
You're supposed to do that.
You're no longer allowed to speak.
How big you are!
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
We're like family.
How big you are!
She looked after her baby.
She took off her coat.
You're arrogant.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
Tom taught Mary to swim.
I left on time.
What exactly did you say?
I met a friend.
She has a distinct English accent.
They won.
I've loved you since the day I first saw you.
Do you remember what you were watching?
There's no hurry.
You should take the time to do that.
You have no idea who that is, do you?
He suddenly tightened his arm around her.
Don't knock it unless you try it first.
That man over there asked me who I was.
Did you make any new friends?
Are you fully recovered?
It is really nice of you.
My parents made me go there.
I've been to Boston countless times.
When was the last time you slept in this room?
His ambition made him work hard.
I don't think I can help you on Monday.
It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
Do you really want me to dance with you?
I'll text you the address.
Why did you make such a mistake?
You don't have to go with Tom.
Am I making sense?
I'm not a teacher and don't want to become one.
I'm going to cook for you.
She should be there at noon.
You'll be late for work.
Could you show me the way to the port?
Are you allowed to go?
She translated it word for word.
Tom is thirteen years old.
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
The flowers were sent by Tom.
Tom seemed to know what he was doing.
Many people believe that money brings happiness.
Her hair grew back.
Come back home.
I always have to wear a tie because of my job.
Mary looks cute no matter what she wears.
I figured it out alone.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
I'm a perfectionist.
He enjoyed cycling.
Do you mind if I join in?
Was that your question?
Out of my way, boy.
He bought himself a new car.
I'm not as fast as Tom is.
She spends a little time each day reading the Bible.
You would have to practice the violin every day.
Today was a tough day.
Hurry up, or we'll be late.
The lawn needs to be watered.
He is used to making speeches.
Make a copy of this report.
Tom drank straight from the bottle.
It's hard to talk about your feelings.
We must take that risk.
What makes you think that Tom prefers living in the country?
That's not where I'm going.
I was drinking milk.
That always helps.
We want to talk with Tom.
The meeting went on until noon.
Her daughter is sick.
He has a point.
I'm not ashamed to tell you.
Looks are not everything.
You're all happy.
We're careful.
Did you see anybody?
Tom cut down the tree with his chainsaw.
Why are you alone?
Her book is famous not only in England but also in Japan.
Tom thought it was a terrible idea.
That was the idea, wasn't it?
You lied to me.
Tom felt safe.
I love playing Chopin.
Do you prefer meat or fish?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?
Is everything all right at home?
Would you mind if we put this off until tomorrow?
I thought that you were able to speak French.
Bring your student ID!
Turn off the TV.
Tom kissed Mary, not Alice.
Do you think it's worthwhile? I don't think so.
Can you take a little break?
She boiled the eggs.
Tom looked through the binoculars.
May I borrow it?
I don't want to do this anymore.
You should buy her a gift card instead.
Of course! Why didn't I think of that before?
Why don't you just ask your parents for money?
Tom saw Mary.
Tom decided to cooperate.
Let's start with the easy stuff.
Tom wasn't in a good mood then.
I want to know what I can do right now.
This is what I found in the cave.
If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
The exact opposite is true.
Didn't I tell you so?
The vacation is over now.
Have you ever been kissed before?
Do you have any brothers?
When you're eighteen years old, you're an adult in the United States.
I'm not counting on Tom to do that.
I'm in a desperate situation.
Ask her what her name is.
A square has four equal sides.
My mother is at home.
Anyone can do it if they try.
Are you ready to do that?
Summer has come.
Give me an example.
It was an ideal day for walking.
I did not understand him at all.
We tend to make mistakes.
Please give me one of these.
Are you ready to do that?
No one would listen.
I have a ringing in my ears.
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
No one had anything left to say.
Tom's lost a lot of blood, but he hasn't lost consciousness.
Country people are often afraid of strangers.
I want to figure this out.
I hate to argue with you.
This tea is too bitter.
I like to help my friends.
I turned off the radio.
This would be a mistake.
Is there something you haven't told us?
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
You have to see it to believe it.
I read about it in the newspaper.
Tom disappeared last month.
That sounds depressing.
I know you are rich.
I want to make you work harder.
That meant no.
I outrank you.
What's wrong with running around your house naked?
I love trying out new things, so I always buy products as soon as they hit the store shelves. Of course, half the time I end up wishing I hadn't.
I love Mary.
He turned the bottle upside down and shook it, but still the honey wouldn't come out.
This cave is full of bats.
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
What're you writing?
It's a no-brainer.
Security was increased in the city.
Tom never told me he was married.
You look like you're busy.
I wasn't there at that time.
Where's Tom going to sleep?
I'm pretty sure Tom has fallen in love with Mary.
I've heard it before.
He borrowed the car from his friend.
What is our plan?
I learned how to ride a bike when I was six years old.
She has no one to turn to.
He has already finished his work.
You must go up the hill.
I just found out what was going on.
What's this street called?
He caught a big fish.
I was starting to lose hope.
I'll be glad to help him.
Do you know how far it is from the station to city hall?
She was born at six a.m. on July 17.
I made you a pair of mittens.
Tom hasn't actually been to Boston yet.
Don't get a stomachache by eating too much.
He lives as if he were a millionaire.
I know you'll do what needs to be done.
I can't believe I actually said that.
I hired a guide.
I hope you'll come.
Why do you need change?
They eat chocolate.
We're comedians.
Tom won't wait much longer.
When is the museum open?
The train got in on time.
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
Please choose wisely.
Today is the hottest day this year.
The post office is closed.
Tom is making tea.
Who are we fighting?
Tom isn't going to let you drive.
I just thought you might want to talk.
Maybe Tom was trying to warn us about something.
I think we have achieved our goals.
Tom knew where Mary was, but he wouldn't tell the police where she was.
It's really not that expensive.
I'll accept your offer.
This is what you must do.
Tom sliced the tomatoes.
I mean no disrespect.
We're not sure yet.
I bet you're busy.
Tom and Mary are really tall.
Why should I take the risk?
She kept on talking while eating.
No one answered.
He begged me to stay.
How may I serve you?
I can stay.
I'd like a fork.
No matter what happens, don't give up.
More and more students are joining the protests.
They deserve it.
Show me your hands.
Get on the bus.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
You've taught us a great deal.
The subway entrance is on the corner.
He gave her a piece of paper.
Get in the back seat.
The girls are as busy as bees.
You're acting weird.
I was speechless.
He walked through the forest.
They play together a lot.
We stayed at home because it was raining.
We've been friends ever since.
I realized what was happening.
It did not come off.
It costs an arm and a leg.
She sat on the bed as her mother braided her hair.
I outrank you.
I know what they're going to do.
The students could not give an answer.
I like this one.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
How important is music in your life?
It's my CD.
You seem busy.
You were fantastic.
Can't you ride a bicycle?
You're probably right.
Let's shake hands.
Have a seat, won't you?
The ship's captain ordered the radio operator to send a distress signal.
I feel lonely.
Apples are red.
I didn't hear anything.
Tom is a fairly good plumber.
I like to be spontaneous.
He must have missed his usual train.
I hear that you are having an unusually cold winter.
I regret missing the chance to meet her.
I'm ready to go.
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
I was at home.
It's not necessary to come tomorrow.
Don't be so impatient.
I have a message I want you to deliver.
Don't spoil your appetite.
I don't wish to anger you.
Do you have enough money?
The police found a dead body in an abandoned car near the park.
You're good.
I found her cat in an empty room.
I wrote a letter in English.
I feel so much better.
Mary looked beautiful to Tom.
I took care of it for you.
You should have nothing to complain about.
I want you out of here.
Their houses are located near the sea.
Tom looks like a girl.
It looks like you were wrong.
How many zoos are there in Australia?
You have to choose your own destiny.
Watch the door.
When did you find out the truth?
Maybe we should try to change that law.
We can talk in front of Tom.
He was completely cleared of the charge against him.
I'm not sure about that.
Where can they be?
Do you want to go to the aquarium?
He bored us with his long stories.
I want to buy my house back.
Where does that bus go?
I'm not sure what you were thinking.
The lemon is sour.
You know what I'm talking about.
I feel much better today.
I was moved to tears by the story.
I'd make a good chaperone.
I doubt that's what really happened.
I had to study English.
I don't like the tie that you're wearing.
The earth is round.
We're investigating it.
His new novel will come out next month.
I am too tired to run.
This tie and that jacket go well together.
Tom didn't get very far.
We look out for each other.
She knew better than to argue with him.
First things first.
He went away without saying a word.
Tom decided to give up.
Tom started yelling.
Would you elaborate?
What do you want now?
There's no class today.
He is still full of energy.
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
She took him to the zoo.
I'm so sorry.
It's quite strong.
I am tired of listening to his long speech.
What is it really about?
My brother hung the picture upside down.
That couple gets soused nearly every night.
We want to know who's the best.
We can't rush these things.
I don't believe my eyes.
They paid separately.
Those are all great ideas.
There is an urgent need for qualified teachers.
The audience consisted mainly of students.
It's beyond me.
I was lonely.
Why wouldn't Tom help you?
I don't like spiders.
I drank three cups of coffee this morning.
We lost.
What did you eat for lunch today?
He achieved his goal.
I hope your assignment in England was successful.
Take a break.
He doesn't look happy to see me.
They were surprised by what they saw.
Tom criticized Mary for not doing the job correctly.
It's frustrating and confusing.
It won't happen again.
What would you do in my place?
The snowstorm raged for a full week.
Are you interested?
They relaxed on the beach.
Can I talk to you a second?
The chicken is cooked.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I am eating a sandwich.
His car isn't here, so he must have gone.
It looks like it's just the two of us.
I don't have time for all of this.
We study English every day at school.
I really like this video.
I just bought a new pair of shoes.
What were you doing there?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Reading is one of life's great pleasures.
You have to be prepared for anything.
Some newspapers distorted the news.
Where have you been?
I'm good at Japanese.
You should always think before you speak.
I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
This task took three hours.
I know Tom might do that.
No one knows where Tom is.
The cat is wet.
Do you see that ship near the island?
It was very different from what I had imagined.
We're not really friends anymore.
I'm capable of doing that.
I was glad to see my old friends.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
I like the mountains more than I like the sea.
He amassed a large fortune before he died.
Spring is my favorite season.
He still has much to learn.
What a stupid question!
She has many handkerchiefs.
She never thinks about him.
Is this your first trip abroad?
I was more than a little shocked by this.
I cried a lot.
I'm from Bulgaria.
We want to take your blood pressure.
It's hard to understand you.
They kicked Tom out of the bar.
Don't you recognize that guy?
Why would anyone do that on purpose?
My father likes strong coffee.
Am I being unreasonable?
Do you mind if I change the channel?
That's what's driving me crazy.
He encountered unexpected obstacles.
The rumor quickly spread.
The doctor instructed me to go on a diet.
I don't really know what to say.
Could you explain it more simply?
He is boiling with rage.
The cat sleeps next to the couch.
The driver told us which bus we should take.
The conference ended two hours ago.
Can you lift this stone?
Everything is now ready for you.
How high can you jump?
How do you prefer your eggs?
Don't tell me what I already know.
I'm glad to have a roof over my head.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
The meeting was held here.
I'm a member of the basketball team.
Show me some others.
He is a man of his word.
He breathed deeply.
Generally speaking, a woman will live longer than a man.
There's no chance that he'll recover.
She's at work, isn't she?
Tom should've listened to you.
I don't care what you do.
I was working when it happened.
Bartender, I'd like to have a drink.
I told her that if I could be of any use I would be glad to help.
She's the most popular girl in the class.
We need to uphold laws against discrimination — in hiring, and in housing, and in education, and in the criminal justice system. That is what our Constitution and highest ideals require.

Tom asked Mary whether she'd like to go shopping.
She held her breath.
At your age, you ought to know better.
I haven't had a barbecue for a long time.
This has all been a mistake.
He walked away.
We need to finish what we started.
You have to tell me the truth.
A bunch of people died in the explosion.
I'm in trouble now.
What happened can't be undone.
Tom knows Mary is wrong.
My birthday falls on Sunday.
I want this guitar.
I learned how to ride a bike when I was six years old.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
Whatever you do, don't forget this.
I had to study French when I was in high school.
I'm thirsty.
He cleaned it up.
We made you a cake.
I'm also learning French.
This tastes like tea.
Tom bought a parrot.
What is this called?
What do tigers eat?

Where's the rest of the team?
All the students are present.
This bed is way too soft for me.
I'll put you through to the president.
Tom is still inside.
Will he recover?
Does Tom put sugar in his tea?
Have you told Tom you're here?
I feel better already.
Don't just stand there.
I'm exhausted.
Tom has to act now.
I hope you're not alone.
I catch the flu every year.
I'll tell him to call you back.
Don't tell me what I can and can't do.
He speaks English as if he were an American.
She's at a meeting.
I'd like to buy half a cake.
It's not very far from here.
I was hoping you'd know.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I had him write it.
I don't want you to go away.
Leave my family alone.
She called off the party.
Sapporo is the fifth largest city in Japan.
Am I included?
I would appreciate a reply.
How long will it be to dinner?
Try to act naturally.
Her honesty is beyond question.
What do you think he meant by that?
I'd like to know what you're doing.
I don't know why Tom hates me so much.
Stop being so nice.
She's only two years old, but she can already count to 100.
He had barely enough money to buy bread and milk.
He tried to stand up.
Don't be rude.
Would it have been better if Tom hadn't been there?
She can't do that.
Do you know what day it is?
I need a little help here.
We lost.
They don't stand a chance.
No one showed up.
Tom pressed a hidden button.
You'd better not go today.
I think Tom is a coward.
I hope to see you again before long.
Why don't you sit here?
Don't do this.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened at school today.
In addition to English, he can speak French.

He sells fruit.
I'll go get the proper forms.

I don't want to eat lunch now.

Is all this necessary?
What does it contain?
I cut myself with a knife.
He had three sons.
Your fly is open!
What time do you usually leave for work?
Tom gave me money.
Do you have any light beer?
Is Tom your name?
In the automotive industry of the 1970's, Japan beat the U.S. at its own game.
I'm proud of my family.
If Tom were taller, he could open the door.
Why don't you join us?
What do you like to eat most?
Look carefully. I'm going to show you how it's done.
He left his hometown at the age of fifteen never to return.
You made it possible.
Tom doesn't want to see you.
Don't handle my books with dirty hands.
Just tell us the truth.
I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it.
This desk is a little too low for me.
Who are you trying to kid?
It's time to eat.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
If you want to be free, destroy your television set.
All the lights were on.
What's the plan?
She met him on the beach.
I prefer that dress to this one.
I don't understand what's bothering you.
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
I don't want to regret anything.
I'd like to get a head start.
It's nonsense to try that.
I let him spend the night in my house.
I wholeheartedly agree.
I know that you can't speak French.
Tom was scary.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
We could meet downtown. Would that be convenient for you?
Hurry, and you will catch the train.
His poems are difficult to understand.
A bat hunts food and eats at night, but sleeps during the day.
Drinking and driving can be dangerous.
Do you need a ride home?
He is a painter.
You're incredibly talented.
I hope that I'll see her.
Can I take a picture here?
I used to go fishing with my father when I was a child.
I'm innocent.
Let me do my job.
I got a taxi in front of the station.
We sure had fun, didn't we?
Tom didn't seem to be aware that he was supposed to do that.
The girls had a catfight.
To try to bring it back would be foolish.
I don't want to be any more burden to my parents.
I'm not in love with you.
He takes a walk every morning.
Mary decorated the cake.
It will take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi.
I'm not exactly sure.
He acted in his own interest.
She visited him on October 20th.
I have a lot of books.
What are these charges for?
Can you help me find it?
I think we both know why I'm here.
A fuse has blown.
Why are you so wet?
He walked away with a sad look on his face.
Paper burns quickly.
It's important that you tell the truth.
They supplied the war victims with food.
I have failed.
Tom hates opera.
What condition is the building in?
I know how women think.
He is very handsome.
Is Tom all right?
Let's split the profits.
Is there a doctor on board?
How could we not win?
I have no plans whatever.
You can't keep something that big a secret.
The band played several marches.
Your pants are unzipped.
I'm chubby.
Was the movie interesting?
Tom usually only wears glasses when he reads.
Where is the emergency exit?
All the students passed the test.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
I really am glad you're here.
I found this under your bed.
I went, too.
You didn't complain, did you?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
He never speaks to me.
This hall holds two thousand people.
I already feel much better.
He ran away so he wouldn't be caught.
I don't need any rest.
The folder is empty.
How good are you?
Then what's your problem?
It's a slippery one.
Can we have a moment alone?
That's not what I had in mind.
Leave my things alone.
Look at that big dog.
Americans admire Lincoln for his honesty.
You have a future.
I just downloaded a lot of files.
I want to go to Korea.
I'll never give up.
You don't have to go.
He knows almost nothing about that animal.
Look in front of you.
Ask me anything you like.
I want to talk to all of them.
That's all they had.
Please correct it.
I saw you snickering.
I'm feeling confused.
How did you enjoy the movie?
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think anyone has lived in this house for years.
It doesn't mean anything.
I really like your paintings.
You don't have to know all the details.
Everyone pretended not to listen.
Tom borrowed a car from a friend.
We are all born mad.
I really don't know.
That was Tom's cousin.
The boys built a raft.
Could you spare me a few minutes?
I'm angry.
I'd like to do shopping on Fifth Avenue in New York.
You'll have to come with us.
It's too sunny to stay inside.
Does the smoke bother you?
When I opened the door, I broke the lock.
He ruined my life.
There are many rooms.
A nice day, isn't it? Why not go out for a walk?
I had a horrible dream last night.
I only quit because you asked me to.
Tom hates being disturbed when he's studying.
Can anyone here speak French?
I am totally confused.
He's an Italian teacher.
Tom was cruel.
I've promised to go to Boston with Tom.
That's no fun.
I apologize to all of you.
I'm glad you came over.
Check these out.
You should eat more.
Tom wasn't wrong, but Mary was.
Are you ready to party?
I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday.
Three buttons are missing from my coat.
The roof is made of thatch.
This is way better.
She lives in Kyoto.
I don't need a loan anymore.

I'd really love a cold glass of milk.
Who's your favorite actor?
My eyes are sore.
I often sing in the shower.
Does Tom still buy you nice things?

Deposit your money in the bank.

They went on an expedition to the Antarctic.
We need some help here.
I can't imagine what you've gone through.
I think we're about ready.
Tom drank lemonade.
My duty is to protect everyone here.
When is the ship due to arrive?
You've been very kind to me.
Where was it published?
I didn't know you were so ambitious.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
I've been here all afternoon.
I'm doing all I can.
Tom said that Mary was engaged.
Is this place far from the bank?
We're not responsible.
You can count on her.
We don't have tea.
I have hives.
She wants to marry a millionaire.
Fight like men.
The fire was soon extinguished.
Please don't go away.
You need to eat something before you go to work.
You've painted the walls, haven't you?
Nothing is more valuable than time, but nothing is less valued.
His cottage is on the coast.
Give it to her.
Just say yes.
Tom walked in.
I think Tom injured himself.
This flower is yellow and the others are blue.
Where is the police station?
He was educated by his grandfather.
He really got to me.
Would you like anything to eat?
Please feel free to ask questions.
He's one of the best.
She has nothing in common with him.
I want to cheer you up.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
Leaving something unfinished is the worst thing you can do.
I have to be back home by seven.
I don't know what we'll do.
What is it that you want me to do?
Do as you're told.
I couldn't do that.
Is anyone here?
How many times did you do that?
He weighs 70 kilos.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
I don't think we need to do that.
That was a big surprise.
I congratulate you on your engagement.
I made a bad decision.
This lid is so tight I can't open it.
He buried his head in his hands.
I have to do my homework.
Is that what you want me to say?
The line is busy again.
I know Tom agrees with me.
He is an honest man and will always remain so.
I'm glad I could help out.
How did you get into my house?
Write your address here.
I'll keep my fingers crossed that everything will go well for you today.
A little knowledge of Spanish will go a long way toward making your trip to Mexico enjoyable.
I saw what you did.
I'm here with a friend.
Why don't you join me?
He decided to have surgery.
It happens all the time.
Would you come with us?
No, you can't.
Please help me take this lid off.
You're the one I've been waiting for.
Wait a second.
Tom commutes to school by bicycle.
They hid in the cellar.
Don't give up without a fight.
Is there anything you want to add to what I just said?
I'm happy you're here.
Did you just realize that?
The climate here is mild.
I'm used to driving a truck.
When I painted this picture, I was 23 years old.
The mother and daughter represented two generations.
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
I'm not a doctor, but a teacher.
Could you just turn around for a second?
Let's discuss the matter later.
I am a bachelor.
I can't put up with his arrogance.
Is there anything you want to say?
All that you have to do is to wait for his reply.
She's busy with her work.
Wash your hands well.
They'll think of something.
This music is from the 40s.
What woke you up?
Look here.
They all have kids.
Did you show it to your parents?
Let's spend the afternoon together.
It isn't that bad.
What is he up to?
The church bells are ringing.
He showed signs of great emotion.
There's a volcano emitting masses of smoke in Iceland.
I'm tired of everything.
I thought you did fairly well.
I've got a lot of good friends.
Tom said he hated me.
You're not telling the truth.
We may as well start at once.
I was able to answer the question.
I'm going to cook you a nice dinner.
I don't need to go to college.
Do you deliver on Sundays?
How do they want to receive their money?
You may not like this book.
Tom woke the children up and told them to get ready for school.
She wanted to return home, but she got lost.
I can't even afford to buy a used car.
His view is quite logical.
Tom said he needed to take a nap.
The house was deserted.
This is all I want.
He may have missed the train.
I still think it's weird.
He twirled his mustache.
I got what you asked for.
My native language is French.
You may catch sight of our house from the train.
I'd like you to do your best.
She found it dull living in the country.
This is impossible.
You should get married again.
A few minutes is all I ask.
They don't have a car.
I will lend you whatever book you need.
Mary is studying in her room.
I don't have a knife.
Is this guy bothering you?
Why can't we talk now?
I always felt like she was hiding something.
These two have very little in common.
That actress is as beautiful as ever.
I think this is the best plan.
I remember it.
Do you want to come sit by me?
That's very hard.
This bicycle is mine.
Tom wants me to coach him.
Think before you speak.
That's fine with me.
Whatever you do, don't push that button.
It's a boys' club.
I'm not allowed to say anything.
He found me a good place.
They seem to be in love with each other.
Maybe you can help us.
Why do you need it?
Now is your chance.
Those were the days.
Sickness prevented him from going out.
Did you not know that?
Stop being so nice to me.
I keep a diary.
What an awful mother!
I like dogs, but my sister likes cats.
I wish you'd never been born.
She must be forty or so.
They made fun of my accent.
Would you please tell me the way?
I really love her older sister a lot.
He doesn't want to play with his toys.
I'm crazy about you.
He is very sensitive to criticism.
Nobody is paying attention to Tom.
Tom let us go.
This shop carries men's clothing.
Are you in favor of the new law?
To tell the truth, I felt lonely.
We're tempting fate.
Don't forget to send the letter.
My wife hates cats.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I did no such thing.
I was one of the last to leave.
I'll complain if I want to.
Tom seems to be seasick.
Would you be friends with me?
The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food.
I also use this study for receiving guests.
How much did you pay for this skirt?
Why do you want this job?
I'm the boss.
He doesn't have any proof.
I know you can help us.
That's all you get.
Did you put on some sunscreen?
We reached the top of the mountain.
English is a global language.
You can do it.
We have plenty of time to spare.
What's up, dude?
You have to obey the law.
I can't kiss you now.
He asked me what was the matter with me.
That accident is a very good example of what happens when you're not careful.
I'll do it with you.
I went to your school.
I found her cat in an empty room.
I'm just making a suggestion.
Hurry up, guys.
She demanded to see the manager.
I met an old friend by chance in Kyoto.
I should like to go for a swim.
Our football team has a good defense.
What a loser!
Do you recognize the man in this photo?
She refused his proposal.
My sister plays the piano every day.
Going out drinking with the guys makes him feel macho.
I brought some samples of my work.
A lot of people do this.
It started to snow.
They looked very happy.
Go back to bed.
This could be a mistake.
A lot of foreigners visit Japan every year.
I want to drink something cold.
They clung together for warmth.
Who are we competing against?
My driver's license expires at the end of this month.
Tom wants to help.
Is this a gag?
She walked slowly so she wouldn't slip.
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
I could not sleep because of the noise.
I was busy cooking.
Have you seen Tom's medical records?
I knew you'd come back to me.
Could you please translate this for me?
She's an alcoholic.
You're resourceful.
I really don't want to disappoint Tom.
It's so easy.
I don't have much to lose.
Do you speak French?
I heard you bought a boat.
How's the job hunt?
When did you arrive?
I shouldn't have walked home late at night by myself.
I hate her now.
Tom felt a little left out.
Has something happened?
There is only one bath towel.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
He must be very angry to say such a thing.
I'm not at all interested.
I know that you feel helpless.
She obeys him.
The old man is angry and bitter.
Don't spoil your appetite.
Tom is a pediatrician.
I'm interested in your work.
Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
Weren't you here yesterday?
We have to warn him.
He had a queer expression on his face.
I can never stay angry at Tom for very long.
Most of her friends are boys.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
That's not entirely true, is it?
This gives me an idea.
She speaks ten languages.
The day is almost over.
Now drink up.
Why did you become a police officer?
The worst is yet to come.
She continued sobbing without looking up.
Has your dog ever bitten you?
They've changed the rules.
When we started this business, neither one of us had had any experience.
Who can be calling me at this hour?
That's very good news.
Are you hiding something?
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
I want to spend more time doing things that make me happy.
You can do whatever you want to.
Do you mind if I leave for a few minutes?
Her grandmother lived to be 88 years old.
I'm very drawn to you.
I like working with you.
That's why I'm not getting married.
Tom won't be going camping with us this weekend.
I'll be raising my prices by three percent next month.
We've been disqualified.
It went viral.
Wait!
Everybody thinks I'm dead.
Would you like me to do something about it?
I knew Tom was all alone.
The price is low, but the quality isn't very good.
He went to London in 1970.
He's extremely happy.
I'm sure.
The comic scenes in the play were overdone.
Why didn't you listen to your father?
She has a strong personality.
Follow me. I'll show you how to get out of here.
I'm a deeply religious man and believe in life after death.
How are you getting along these days?
Is one of you Tom?
You will soon get used to the change of climate.
I would like to eat now.
How long does a bear sleep?
I just heard that Tom and Mary are moving to Boston.
You make it look easy.
That's my sister's camera.
They plan to have a party.
Counting sheep helps you to fall sleep.
She turned him down.
You don't need to answer that question.
You gotta get more organized.
Is this really happening?
She couldn't convince him to accept the bribe.
It's not like you're going to get arrested or anything.
He and his friend sat on the bench.
We study French.
You're crafty.
Tom is awful.
Get out of my bed.
We've accomplished a lot of things.
We're friends now.
We're out of ammo.
She remained single all her life.
This is just a misunderstanding.
We should go.
We tried our best.
You never told me that you didn't know how to speak French.
It seems that you're not having a good time here.
I didn't tell Tom Mary was here.
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
It's a nice day to eat outside.
I want to talk to you about tomorrow.
He can do it far better than I can.
I'm a social worker.
Good luck with the new job.
We're all OK.
He's coming.
Science does not solve all of life's problems.
I hope that she will help me.
It's bulky.
Tom has only one week to decide.
What's Tom asking?
Those are your options.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
I didn't take it that seriously.
I have an ache in my arm.
It is wrong to tell lies.
We'll be here all day.
Are you looking for a job?
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
Was it a robbery?
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
Does he speak English?
I hope that I can do it.
Where is the boy?
I like to read books.
Drivers must look out for children crossing the road.
I lost my umbrella.
I was a bit tense.
You can't hurt my feelings.
I know everybody here.
I never closed the windows.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
Leave the room immediately.
He didn't get caught.
They are very big.
They all envied my new car.
He told me good things about you.
How about making me a cup of tea?
We will present our idea to the committee.
I told them they shouldn't move.
The game's almost over.
Who are you thinking about?
Do you have any kids?
He was disappointed.
I hope they don't resort to violence to accomplish their goals.
Our education system needs to be seriously revamped.
This is so crazy.
You are responsible for what you do.
Look around you.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
The town has many tall buildings.
She is about my age.
He peddled his "miracle cure" to desperate cancer patients.
I really want Tom to stop doing that.
Stir the soup.
You owe me a kiss.
Are you sure about this?
It is warmer today than yesterday.
I promise to work hard.
You're in charge now.
He must be crazy to treat his parents like this.
May I ask a favor of you?
I'll do it with you.
I really like your paintings.
I think it's sad to have no friends.
Thanks for dinner.
They guarantee this clock for a year.
This is a funny sentence.
Please don't make me eat that.
He often gets sick.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
It gets worse.
We have nothing to complain about.
The job isn't anywhere near done.
I had trouble doing that.
I don't know what else I can say.
There is no urgency.
Your lives will be spared if you surrender.
I don't know what it is, but it's something very big.
I called a doctor.
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
He never looked back.
It's your turn to sing.
She came out on top.
It really was hard.
Do you like mine?
I'm not accustomed to getting up early.
I like both of them very much.
I am singing with my children.
I need time to think about all of this.
I have to fight.
I figured it out by myself.
You always said you wanted to become a scientist. Why didn't you?
They're not home yet.
Smoking in bed is dangerous.
It was all your imagination.
I went twice.
When traveling, it is easy to get lost.
I usually walk.
Show us the way.
I have little interest in history.
Her remark got on my nerves.
I shouldn't have gotten up so early.
You still haven't told me why you decided not to go.
I thought you'd be much fatter.
Mathematics is not just the memorization of formulas.
I'll do my homework after I watch television.
He was sick, but he went to school.
She nodded in response to my question.
I'm certainly not your friend.
Do you think I still love Tom?
I think Tom feels the same way.
Tom is much older than he looks.
You don't have the right.
Thieves plundered the museum.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
Schools and roads are services paid for by taxes.
It is very kind of you to invite me.
We found it here.
It's better to be approximately right than completely wrong.
That's what's most important.
I don't really care what you think.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up.
I'm sort of an introvert.
Don't even try it.
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
You're so picky.
You look very tired.
Tom isn't sure this is a good plan.
Luckily, he won the championship.
We're making progress.
The crew abandoned the ship.
He was groomed from a young age to take over the family business.
Let me give you a ride to the station.
I know how important Tom is to you.
I wasn't involved.
I am working on my new book.
She got her daughter a personal computer.
I thought Tom was in school.
Look at this.
He sent me some American magazines.
I can understand your point of view.
Can you stay for a while?
They are currently attending a meeting.
I'll make a reservation.
You're the teacher.
Did you ever talk to him?
I loved working here with you.
I don't want it.
You're not a teenager yet.
I can't wait to see you guys again.
He's your son.
She combed her hair and bound it with a ribbon.
I guess my mind just wandered.
He doesn't eat raw fish.
Where are you heading?
Good luck to you!
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
I hope it was worth it.
The slaughter of the prisoners was a barbarous act.
Tom wasn't able to talk at the meeting.
The meat was crawling with maggots.
Tom said he didn't know you.
Tom couldn't go anywhere without his dog.
I belong here.
Please leave.
Do you still have feelings for her?
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will take Mary to the party.
The cats are afraid of water.
It is almost impossible to learn a foreign language in a short time.
I advise you to change clothes.
You're the only person that I can trust.
Seize him!
That's just a personal opinion.
Nobody can understand him.
They had once helped each other.
We're not your parents.
Can I have this dance?
I don't know who you are anymore.
How many CDs do you have?
I'm not very organized.
Get that dog away from me.
I talked to the girl you told me about.
She looked at him with hatred.
Tom will take care of this.
After the summer holidays, the children have to go back to school.
What're you doing about this?
It's wonderful to be back.
You'll be crying before long.
It seems that no one knew the truth.
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden.
Mom is always right.
He is a dreamer.
When did it end?
Tom isn't a very good skier.
This isn't quite what I had in mind.
He invited me to a party.
It looked cheap.
That was really important.
Forget it.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
I want to spend all my time with you.
The school looks like a prison.
Give us a second.
We want to talk to you.
I broke my arm.
The doctor cured her of her disease.
I would like my breakfast in my room at eight o'clock sharp.
I felt the same way.
Did I startle you?
Tom had no children.
You're supposed to do that.
What I want isn't tea, but coffee.
If you behave like a servant, you'll be treated like a servant.
You have to work harder to make up for lost time.
Our car broke down in the middle of the street.
We don't go to school on Saturdays.
Which one of you is the psychic?
My father likes traveling by air.
My grandfather on my mother's side passed away ten years ago.
She always gets her own way.
You're in big trouble.
She died from TB.
We looked ridiculous.
We have run out of gas.
Mary is my half-sister.
My work is not as easy as yours.
You're psyched.
My teacher is a stickler for grammar.
I don't feel like a man anymore.
I have nothing more to do today.
I'm not being unreasonable.
We need to work as a team.
It was the best night of my life.
I want him to play the guitar.
Tom gave Mary something.
You have to look out for other cars when you drive.
What do you have against those people?
I don't know if I can trust you.
Could you lend me the book?
Father got back from the office at six.
My baby brother sleeps ten hours a day.
Do you think it's wise to wear your uniform today?
Tom wanted it.
They paid separately.
The president's son leads the special forces.
He said, "It's nine o'clock."
He did the opposite.
Have you told your mother?
My bag is too old. I must buy a new one.
Feeding pigeons is prohibited.
That reminds me of home.
I was thinking of getting one.
Why didn't you dance with him?
Can my daughter go to school?
I always wanted a daughter.
How do I make you go away?
We can't open this yet.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
I wasn't really listening.
I need you to come with me.
Tom is very different from his father.
This car is like new.
Come with us.
We all agreed.
How am I supposed to dress?
Why can't I hear?
What's wrong with this?
I don't know what you really want.
Where did you take these pictures?
I appreciate this so much.
Take your time. There's no hurry.
He was born to be a painter.
She gave him the car.
Tell me how the robbery went down.
Why don't you get a job?
I hate hospital food.
I don't drink coffee.
That's really not funny.
I can handle it.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Tom was pacing back and forth in the parking lot, waiting for Mary.
I didn't believe him at first.
Are you finished?
He did not come till noon.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
I want to know why.
For further information, see page 16.
What should I tell the kids now?
Do you have enough money?
She risked her life to save him.
You're very timid.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo.
This shop is a rental video shop.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
What is the purpose of the stock market?
I'm not convinced of that.
Mary made her own wedding dress.
My older sister is good at singing.
I can't make it to your party next weekend.
He committed suicide by taking poison.
I'm allowing you to go.
My father is busy as a bee every day.
I get anything I want.
The rent is far too high.
You have a good lawyer.
The planet nearest to the sun is Mercury.
Let's forget about what happened yesterday.
I live next to a dam.
Were you shot?
We're retiring.
I'll take attendance first.
I can see right through you.
Tom is at work.
I think you've got what I need.
The president's son leads the special forces.
Not feeling well, I stayed home all day.
Your eggs are getting cold.
The red lines on the map represent railways.
You should be careful.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
The sentence doesn't have any grammatical errors.
I wish he had gone on to university.
Tom showed Mary something.
On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers.
He has made the company what it is today.
What time does it open?
Are you coming to the party?
How much are the oranges?
Reading books will make you smarter.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to see you when you came by today.
Drinks are on me.
He has two cars.
We'll let you know the result within a week.
That tastes terrible.
Don't drink on an empty stomach.
Tom bought gas and paid in cash.
They sat side by side.
Can they see us?
No one can figure it out.
As for me, I have nothing to say.
Please see to it that the child does not go near the pond.
There are no chairs in this room.
Tell us the truth now.
Nobody knows your secret.
They will survive.
You're surrounded.
I'll call you at noon.
It tastes like chicken.
I like your glasses.
You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?
You need to be careful.
Are you traveling alone?
Loosen up.
There are some cookies under the table.
They were all hysterical.
Tell Tom that I won't be there.
I think they like you.
We all die.
They formed a swim team.
Our budget won't allow that luxury.
Those two children were the same age.
We picked apples so we could make an apple pie.
He is pleased with his new shoes.
This is such a dumb idea.
We believe the time of death was 2:20 p.m.
There's nothing in the trunk.
You don't need my help.
I never want to see that guy again.
He will be waiting for you.
I went to school on foot in those days.
Tom doesn't always get up early, but he always gets up before Mary does.
This box is too heavy for me to carry.
I don't understand why you want it.
The last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain.
You may use my typewriter.
I don't think I can help you.
All the students protested against the war.
Tom is making faces.
They're doing it right.
I know that name.
I feel funny today.
I've been shopping all day.
It is no good to you.
Is Tom related to Mary?
Who did you go there with?
I can't eat any more.
Did I do something wrong?
Would you trust them?
There's plenty of blame to go around.
I don't remember Tom's exact words.
One hour of sleep before midnight is worth two hours after.
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
I grew up in Australia.
This place is large, isn't it?
We need to make sure that this is true.
This letter isn't addressed to you.
Would you please send me a catalogue by mail?
Tom helped Mary carry her suitcases.
Get out of my house.
I know that I didn't do that.
I met Tom there.
The fog has lifted.
We've just got to keep talking.
Don't forget your costume.
May I see your invitation please?
As soon as I've finished doing that, I'll help you.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
Are you old enough to drive?
She gave her entire life to the study of physics.
We respect each other.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Try not to forget anything.
I always counted you as a friend.
I'm no hero.
What crimes have you committed?
There were three empty wine bottles on the table.
I want to watch that movie again.
I suppose I'd do the same thing if I were you.
You owe me thirty bucks.
They met for the first time in London.
I have no objection to paying a special fee if it is necessary.
I'll go back to Boston.
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
His novel is beyond my comprehension.
Call me this evening.
Have you been smoking?
Do you think I'm too tall?
This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
It was all covered with dust.
She gave him something cold to drink.
I can teach you how to do this.
The school is on the hill.
Do you like apple pies?
How many teeth does a horse have?
Do you know where they come from?
What happens if I press this button?
That's what we've been told.
You'll be the first to know.
Tom is the tallest in his family.
I don't think this is funny.
I know who said that.
Everybody wanted me to do it.
His wife's a friend of mine.
I think I know you.
You can't come in.
It's your only shot.
You're grumpy.
I don't drink a lot.
I have a date.
I just didn't want you in here.
We'll meet again in October.
It was not until yesterday that I knew the news.
He did his best only to fail again.
It'll work now.
We've been friends.
Where do you want to live after you retire?
She looks as if she were drunk.
You probably just want to be alone.
You can't change the past.
That program is still far from perfect.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
I share your feelings.
What's wrong with the way I dress?
I have at least ten books.
I collect postcards.
Does someone here know how to do this?
I don't understand French.
Should we be worried?
What do you intend to do with the money?
I don't want to hear about it again.
Grammar is very complicated.
Does Tom want something?
Did I startle you?
Are you good at skiing?
For some reason, people have been avoiding me like the plague ever since I got back from India.
Don't touch the flowers.
That's my best guess.
Kissing Tom was a mistake.
I refuse to allow it.
Fill in the blanks.
Sugar is sweet.
You should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive.
That's where the problem lies.
I had to beg my friends to come to my party.
You're almost as tall as Tom.
You're lucky you didn't die.
Ten years is a long time to wait.
Move over.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
Get a job.
This book is fascinating.
He left ten minutes ago.
The point of play is that it has no point.
I hope he will get better.
I have almost no money now.
You're welcome to come with us if you want to.
I cannot praise her enough.
Boy was I naive.
The girl was afraid of her own shadow.
Tom is very good-looking.
They spoke briefly.
What's the matter with you?
It was all over.
It's a large one.
He cut his finger with the knife.
I currently live in Boston.
Return to your room.
You look great in these photos.
I miss my friends.
I know this from bitter experience.
I'm hiding.
Are you here to help us?
It looks good.
We dislike violence.
The police are investigating the cause of the crash.
I'll ask him where he is planning to go during the vacation.
Tom is obviously worried.
The child is learning quickly.
I thought you could help me.
If you'd asked me, I'd have told you.
I never liked school.
You're a really good cook.
I only have one so far.
Without your help, I would fail.
I'm smashed.
Tom didn't tell his parents that he had gotten an F on the test.
I persuaded him that he was wrong.
I don't want this shirt.
I rarely talk on the phone.
We could wait.
Fill it with regular, please.
You are entirely correct.
A blast of cold air swept through the house.
Stop crying.
Nobody is forcing you to do this.
Two roundtrip tickets to Osaka, please.
Our children all go to the local school.
We must avoid war at all cost.
Let's keep quiet.
Forward this to everyone you know.
You don't have to apologize.
I wonder if I can do that.
She liked it.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
Are you doing anything special?
Many people think I'm crazy.
He is my best friend.
The cost of living has gone up.
I realize that there's a problem.
Tom is a staunch conservative.
They're carnations.
This book is very good.
Everything was wrong.
I thought I could trust you.
That guy annoys me.
Who hid my suspenders?
He must have been ill.
Where do they live?
It was worth it.
It took me three hours to write the letter.
I have to go.
He was raised in the United States, but his native language is Japanese.
Everyone was surprised.
Something is going on today.
That's one interpretation.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.
You're very forward.
What happened in here?
They just want someone they can blame.
My girlfriend is crying.
We should take a break.
Perhaps you won't have to do that.
I think we're all right.
They always played tennis here.
What made her so angry?
My dad is very strict.
I've painted the ceiling.
You'll have to take his place in case he can't come.
Do you charge for delivery?
Tom told me he was retired.
He's older, but no wiser.
I'm sorry my father is out.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
If you know the answer to this question, please tell me.
I don't have enough money yet.
Your guess is almost right.
If he had worked harder, he could have succeeded.
You had better ask the doctor for advice.
You're very funny.
This is the end of my story.
His sleeve touched the greasy pan.
I have many dreams.
We want new ideas, not old ones.
You're a liar.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't leave the house last Saturday.
Don't tell your mother what you've seen here.
Most people only want to hear their own truth.
I'd be happy to cooperate.
I moved out of my parent's house to live on my own.
He is French by birth, but he is now a citizen of the USA.
Tell me why you're upset.
He teaches English to his friends.
Anybody could do this.
Are you proud of me?
He has another son.
How in the world did you find me?
You should've started without me.
Where are the shoes?
I don't know how to talk to kids.
I'll pay you.
I have some problems to take care of.
How did you get to be a cop?
I'll need your help.
Is this your room?
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
You must be careful when talking to a European.
Will you send it by mail?
A year has passed since he came here.
We talk about it all the time.
Tom has an American accent.
I didn't say I wasn't going.
I think I am overworked.
Is it a compliment?
Thank you for your explanation.
He handed in his resignation to his boss.
Did you enjoy your holiday?
He was tenacious.
I'm thirty years older than you.
She bought him a dog.
Do you want to get out of here?
Is that what you have in mind?
I want to make friends with your sister.
Do you hear me?
I will go cycling even if it rains.
I don't want to stop.
He is determined to go to England.
There are lots of things we've got to fix.
I thought you wanted to come with us.
Are you writing a letter?
You're too loud.
If that is true, then he is not responsible for the accident.
The Giants got clobbered yesterday.
He never saw his mother again.
This meat has gone bad.
Who among us is perfect?
When he came, I was writing a letter.
I look forward to our next meeting.
I take a bath once a day.
I don't even like you.
Did you turn off the heater?
Tom makes everyone nervous.
They must have known it all along.
Are you frightened?
Is this time different?
They concluded that he had told a lie.
Don't make fun of other people.
I was going to call him, but thought better of it.
Tom is the only person Mary knows here.
Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I'd like a daiquiri.
You're not allowed to swim here.
This is urgent.
He is kind.
What song was Tom singing?
I'll drive you home.
He emptied his glass.
I've got to get dressed for school.
I haven't seen these pictures in years.
I told you it was a waste of time.
He is a man of few words.
I hope something good happens before the day is over.
You're not thinking clearly.
Do you have any rock CDs?
Tom is afraid of making mistakes.
It's easier this way.
I've been accused of murder.
Where's the dog?
I keep a dog.
They're smiling at each other.
I was born in Boston in 1995.
I'm glad to see that you're studying harder than you used to.
It's very sticky.
The interview began at 10 o'clock.
He is not as clever as my brother.
I need to go.
I knew you wouldn't do that.
The company is in financial trouble.
What's she doing?
Go down to the cellar to get some wine.
I don't belong here.
I'll see if I can find a cab.
I haven't seen her since last month.
You came too late.
What's your first name?
We're not convinced yet.
What's with all the questions?
I don't plan on retiring yet.
The girl went into the forest to look for mushrooms.
Who invited you here?
Well then, what are we waiting for?
I left something in the room.
I sent him a letter to let him know my decision.
I'm waiting for the ferry.
I can't do it today.
What can you make out?
What was I saying?
He squashed the insect with the heel of his foot.
I'll fix you a cup of tea.
I have difficulty breathing.
We were very sorry we couldn't help them.
You're very clever.
Who is the boss here?
I really can't do that.
You have your hat on backwards.
I don't want to live by myself.
That can't be helped.
I've never trusted strangers.
Have you got something for me?
I think this is important.
Did Tom leave a message?
He is eager to go to China.
Tom is a monster.
Most Swiss citizens speak two or three languages.
I know it by heart.
She was envious of her cousin's success.
We're confident.
That no longer matters.
He doesn't tan.
I don't actually have them.
I'd like to kiss Mary.
My sons are soldiers.
Let's get rid of that one.
I'm not satisfied.
No one is coming.
We should study together.
You are taller than me.
She accompanied him on the piano.
I didn't know you could speak French.
We're so glad to have you here.
I am not wholly convinced that you are right.
My kids bought me this.
I just can't help worrying about you.
A few were drunk most of the time.
Hello everyone!
They probably saw our ship come into port.
I wasn't invited.
Some people gain weight when they stop smoking.
I've got to go to the bathroom.
Tom is just slightly taller than Mary.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
You might want to try it sometime.
I don't want my name on this report.
What for?
You're disturbing the whole neighborhood.
I wish I could change that.
Thanks for the memories.
The bill amounted to 100 dollars.
The weather is unusual today.
She was always complaining about her husband.
Glad to see you, Tom.
The cat dug its claws into my hand.
I knew you'd mess things up.
He won't make it.
I'll sleep here.
Your name and flight number, please?
People who wait on you here are very friendly.
Tom obviously didn't know about it.
You don't have to get up so early.
No one knew that.
I've had a wonderful time here.
Birds make their nests in trees.
I think Tom is going to come back.
I can't buy this because I don't have enough money.
She told him that her father had died.
What can I get rid of?
We were at school together.
Do you take travelers' checks?
Don't sneak up on me like that.
That seems to make sense.
There's nothing wrong with him.
He had a classic education.
Tom doesn't like beef.
A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert.
Tom drinks at least three liters of water every day.
I don't want to see you again.
That experiment led to a great discovery.
Are you telling me that I can't go?
I don't believe it happened that way.
It was just a matter of time.
Some people only get married to prevent their wives from marrying somebody else.
Give me a definite answer.
I dealt with it.
You need to get out of the house more.
I hope not.
They say that old house is haunted.
He told me about it.
I want the fan.
Don't make me laugh.
It is getting warmer day by day.
I went to the airport by taxi.
My laptop battery doesn't last as long as it used to.
Do you need a lift?
I have insurance.
Look at my arm.
Come and dance with me.
I don't want to fail again.
Give my regards to your aunt and uncle.
This is completely my fault.
They worked each day from the time the sun rose until it set.
I hear from my mother once in a while.
I go to school because I want to learn.
The water's warm.
Tom and Mary know each other so well that they often finish each other's sentences.
He knows better than to believe such a thing.
Someone stole my bicycle.
Keep all medicines out of reach of children.
I was barely able to work.
Tom is always dissatisfied.
Can I exchange yen for dollars here?
I wasn't invited to the opening ceremony.
I'll be there in five minutes.
Tom wanted Mary to say that she loved him.
I just don't want you to have it.
I want you to sit with me.
That wasn't so hard to admit, was it?
It rains a lot in June.
Would you like it washed?
Now that you are an adult, you should know better.
Why are you wearing that?
Please be quiet, everybody.
I outrank you.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
I saw you.
As soon as she wakes up, we'll turn on the music.
Under no circumstances can we accept checks.
I know what you're doing.
This is for you, Tom.
He's wet.
Adding comments makes the code easier to read.
Someone is tapping at the door.
Japan's population is larger than that of Britain and France put together.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I lost my trust in him.
Call me back.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
She left her umbrella in the train.
Just one moment, please.
He does not watch TV at all.
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
How's everybody doing?
Tom makes a lot of mistakes.
How strong he is!
I love that commercial.
Why should I give you this?
A new road is under construction.
You're such a tattletale.
I bear him no malice.
If you want to sell your old sofa, why not put an advertisement in the local paper?
I hope you won't be disappointed.
Would you like ice?
Tom says he'll be a bit late.
Now that my brother is a university student, he has to do a lot of reading.
That might not be possible.
I can't believe you're involved in this.
It was extremely cold.
Don't you get it?
They chatted about the weather.
She testified against him.
Has the fever gone down?
I know that he keeps his promise.
When we hear of a divorce we assume that it was caused by the inability of those two people to agree upon fundamentals.
I like canned fruits.
Did I give you enough time?
I have a poor imagination.
It was very windy.
I go to bed at ten o'clock at night.
She looked ghostly.
We're not going to eat anything.
One can't help many, but many can help one.
Tom doesn't know where Mary buys her groceries.
You have lovely eyes, don't you?
We're closing early.
I've been learning how to write kanji with a brush.
Put the coat on the hanger.
Tom studies at Harvard.
It doesn't look good at all.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
I'll help.
The hero finally defeated the evil scientist.
You've made no allowance for the fact that he is young.
I thought Tom was sleeping.
I began driving our tractor when I was 12 years old to help my father out at harvest time.
This is the book I want to buy.
Why are you so busy today?
Tom is biting his nails.
Keep talking.
I went to the park last Sunday.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
I don't think Tom has anything in his bag.
I didn't want to speak French.
I'm trustworthy.
Tom vehemently denied the accusations.
I don't know what I know.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
I can't say anything now.
He met an unexpected obstacle.
After what happened, I would've thought Tom would go back to Boston.
I am the leader of this team.
No one came.
I am better.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
Is your father a doctor?
Something is slowing down my computer.
I really hope things work out for you.
I get off there, too.
Don't be late to school again.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
He went so far as to call me a liar.
Avoid it at all cost.
You have been warned.
He left her all alone.
I like to sing songs.
Please phone him.
I'm afraid I have a touch of a cold.
I need to see Tom now.
Can you hold on for a second?
My room has a large closet.
I can't stand it anymore.
What's that stain?
I will have to study harder.
I've got plans for you.
I'm still here.
I'll go anywhere you want.
You are nothing but a student.
It took me three days to clean the room.
Back off.
Tom is back in his apartment.
He deals in used cars.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
They were all teachers.
It rained for a week.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
I'm not sure.
He was driving at over 120 kph when the accident happened.
Will you still be here this afternoon?
If you need more information, we are happy to send it.
We are moving next month.
What is it you want me to do?
Tom shut his mouth.
Fish and red wine don't go together.
You've always been that way.
Anger showed on his face.
Try to eat a little more.
The wind scattered the leaves about.
She managed to drive a car.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same thing.
Keep that thing away from me.
Let's continue working together to make that happen.
Tom told me he was determined to do that.
You start.
The teacher gave way to the students' demand.
Aren't you a little young for this position?
Are you out of your mind?
Was that all you saw?
Tom's father is a swimming teacher.
I am what I am today thanks to my parents.
The donkey brayed.
May I do it right now?
I really must be going.
You get out only what you put in.
I hate that movie.
This dictionary is as useful as yours.
They teased the new student.
Do you know where Tokyo Tower is?
You should meet him.
I'm a high school student.
She easily catches cold.
I'm going to figure this out.
Most people understand this.
I've no idea.
We've got to start somewhere.
Her face was sooty.
I swear I didn't do anything.
He ate the whole apple.
It's way past your bedtime.
How about we go for a drink?
I haven't seen her since then.
No matter what you do, I'll still love you.
He's a slacker.
I remembered it.
Do you know how to do this?
My sister married a high school teacher last June.
Tom was overjoyed to see Mary.
Do you want to know why Tom left?
You have no fever.
They broke out into spontaneous laughter.
Are you crazy?
I'm winning.
How important are children to you?
There's a cat in my house.
This city is famous for its beautiful park.
I don't think it was a mistake.
Where were they sent?
I didn't know Tom was such a good dancer.
He did it again.
Tom has his mother's eyes.
We're leaving here.
Please close the door behind you.
I was able to play piano very well.
Because my mother was ill, I could not go there.
You don't mean that, do you?
It looks like you want to say something.
My study is upstairs.
I couldn't do anything.
You are blinded by love.
Just don't drop it.
I'm not persuaded.
There's another way out.
I'd like a room with a good view.
He deals in grain.
I'm not surprised you don't know the answer.
Legend has it that this house is haunted.
Do it the way he tells you to.
She looked lonely.
I just try not to think about it.
What did Tom show you?
I do hear something.
You'll be all right again in a couple of days.
I have to go there myself.
Ignore them.
What's the Wi-Fi password?
I don't know what I owe you.
I'm not sure Tom is ready.
Tom is boring.
Let's say that you're right.
I know that Tom was unfair.
Let me get this straight.
I had no idea you could speak French.
I remember both of you.
I stopped laughing.
We'd like a bottle of rosé.
Do you mind if I help myself?
We need authorization.
I never loved you.
It's not a difficult problem.
I hate math most of all.
Your parents ought to know it.
The boy gathered a handful of peanuts and put them in a small box.
Drug addiction is a cancer in modern society.
Do you know why he has been absent from school?
I told my mom I was gay and it didn't faze her at all.
That was really nice.
I need my privacy.
It's considered to be an important matter.
Here is a list of things you should avoid eating.
Tom and Mary value their privacy.
You did your part.
I hate this job.
Would you like to be seated?
I know who it was.
Please say hello to your family.
I felt awful.
I don't have an answer.
Do you want to give it another try?
Should we wait for Tom?
I've never seen you like this.
Get up early tomorrow morning!
Can I take a message?
Just think about how you'd feel in a similar situation.
I went not once, but twice.
Culture is like jam, the less you have, the more you spread it.
Do you have a lawyer?
I swallowed my pride.
Be confident.
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
This is a major crisis.
This is very true.
Tom's dog is a pretty good swimmer.
Let's hope it stays that way.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
That was a good concert.
Are you still sleepy?
I didn't realize you were awake.
Hurry up, please.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
It's dangerous to live near a volcano.
Tom, are you awake?
I've still got paperwork to do.
We ran after the thief.
He lives just around the corner.
I had a bad dream last night.
You've still got all your life in front of you.
I left a note on your door this morning.
I am better.
I'm not sure about that.
There's no reason for you to fear for your safety.
Unless you hurry, you will be late for school.
You've done nothing but complain ever since you got here.
All you have to do is fill in this form.
I was too stunned to talk.
Tom really wants to lose weight.
I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find out who hacked into our system.
I think you know that's not a good idea.
Have you seen my keys?
I make it a rule to take a walk for half an hour every morning.
I didn't think that you could do that.
I'm telling you the truth.
Another man has died.
I just got up. Give me a few minutes to get ready.
I don't even want to know.
I just feel so helpless.
The plane was about to take off.
He accepted my idea.
Strange to say, no one voted for the candidate.
Switzerland is a neutral country.
I don't remember that happening.
He decided to give it a try.
Let me get my lawyer on the phone.
She's waiting for you at home.
They have enough money.
I'm extremely tired.
That's under discussion.
Wild animals live in the forest.
I relaxed.
Tom made Mary cry.
He assumed full responsibility for it.
I was moved by his tears.
Someone took my stuff.
They really hate each other.
She didn't press him for an explanation.
They won't find it.
The stream flows into the pond.
You'd better check this out.
The people crowded round the injured man, but they made way for the doctor when he reached the scene of the accident.
What are your thoughts on this?
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
Tom is very stubborn.
Did something happen to Tom?
You can't save me.
You have the right to know.
There must be a way to arrive at a diplomatic solution.
I don't like writing.
He said, "So long, my friends," and left us.
This old building isn't worth fixing up. It would be better to tear it down.
I take a bath every morning in the summer.
You're not married, are you?
Did you send them?
I don't know what I was expecting.
Tom is just a friend of ours.
I've never trusted strangers.
Don't touch my car.
My head really aches.
I was able to catch the last train because I walked very quickly.
We've got bigger problems than that.
She wrote to me to come at once.
I have to make some calls.
She stood up and walked to the window.
They were responsible for the accident.
Do you see a black horse?
Are you crazy?
It's hard to choose.
I want to become a singer.
How are you going to do that?
She's very afraid of dogs.
That's so weird.
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
Tom said that Mary was reliable.
Why are we here?
He was walking up the hill at a steady pace.
Don't stare at me like that.
I can't believe that I'm really here.
The accident happened two years ago.
Are you winning?
We won the match.
Tom is going to investigate.
My uncle made a fortune.
My sister will get married early next year.
I don't think everyone gave up.
I want you to see this.
You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?
Tell me where he is.
I can hardly wait until tomorrow.
Your ideas are weird.
Seven is sometimes considered a lucky number.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
He can hardly walk.
I don't even have a boyfriend.
You ought to have told me that before.
He has the habit of standing up when he is angry.
I've never worked this hard before.
You seem to know all the answers.
They strolled along the beach.
Where do I sleep?
How have you been getting along lately?
He was clearly embarrassed.
I have faith in you.
Why don't you take a look at this data?
Have you seen him before?
Keep Tom safe.
How do I get to the library?
I don't have change.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
We both have to study French.
Do ants have ears?
The door's locked.
Your philosophy of life is different than mine.
Why didn't you go to the police?
What is the total number of students?
She quit school for health reasons.
Back off.
Enjoy your meal!
Can we do this another time?
She looked away.
Where are you going to go?
Your guess is wrong.
There's nothing you can say that'll change my mind.
I met one of my friends on my way home.
This can't happen again.
The following images are not for the faint of heart.
I wonder who did that.
He looks after us.
Not all birds build nests.
You probably don't remember me.
Give me the diamonds.
You're the teacher.
I'll take responsibility.
This suitcase is too heavy for me to carry.
Why are you here so early?
We're afraid we'll miss our train.
Did she say it?
I don't want to offend you.
Why are you busy today?
My father works in a factory.
We are having breakfast.
Tom loves gambling.
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
I feel blue.
Can we change rooms?
Tom sat down and waited.
I'd rather go for a walk.
You might be right.
Please shut the door.
The car had two broad stripes painted on the hood and the trunk.
I can only import GIF files.
It's not getting worse.
I just have so much on my mind.
We didn't look very long.
Tom plays tennis after school three days a week.
She took a ten-day trip to Europe with her friends.
I'm sorry, but it's really not possible.
That's why I worry about you.
This has never happened before.
We spent a lot of time with them.
I was married for three years.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
My feet are killing me.
Tom says he has no choice.
He took poison by mistake.
I have a week to do my homework.
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that.
Tom is teaching French.
It is dangerous to fly in this heavy fog.
This job is kind of boring.
I know that's not true.
Are you seriously thinking about getting a divorce?
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Tom and Mary have three daughters.
It's not a joke.
They have no natural predators.
This book is much more useful than that one.
Do you have change for a dollar?
This dress would look good on you.
Break it up!
Let him go.
Raise your hand if you have a question.
I'm concerned for my kids.
He is suffering from toothache.
I'll guard the door.
If you listen carefully to my instructions, it'll save you some time.
Could you leave me one?
His story may not be true.
Tom needed something.
He came here ten minutes ago.
Keep on smiling.
We cannot meet your demands.
I like cats.
Take a look at these.
It seems that something has happened.
We had lunch early.
He used to get up early.
Didn't you know that Tom could play the guitar?
I need someone who can speak French.
He saw the girl.
They found out.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
I figured something was up.
I can't find the address of my hotel.
What a shock!
I worked hard all day long yesterday.
He will arrive there about five o'clock.
Reservations are not required.
He's in his fifties.
You know I don't dance.
I'm used to staying up late.
Make sure you don't let the dog outside.
I'm glad you decided to come.
Did you forget?
It is almost three.
I always obeyed the rules.
He is very good at playing violin.
It's a good school.
Lawyers are all liars.
We're looking for a place to sleep.
We shared everything.
This shouldn't take too much time.
Where's the bathroom?
Try again.
You've been warned.
Isn't that a little dishonest?
You need to leave here at once.
His grandfather died of cancer a year ago.
The tiles that fell from the roof broke into very small pieces.
Why are you so insecure?
Does your school have a library?
I run every day.
I'll go get us something to eat.
I think I've broken my arm.
I hate liars.
I'll never forget your kindness as long as I live.
Put yourself in my place.
If it had not been for your help, I would certainly have failed.
I want to send this letter to Japan.
Men never cry.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
It's essential that we find them.
That's going to cause some problems.
No official complaint was filed.
Come quickly.
I'd like to get rid of all these things.
I think Tom is going to like it here.
You're very helpful.
Who did you think I was?
I'm not completely naive.
Don't trample on the grass.
When I was your age, I had a girlfriend.
I caught a cold and was in bed yesterday.
We're friends from way back.
They come from the same country.
I had to do it.
She is a very intelligent young lady.
You were hurt, weren't you?
We lost all of our funding.
Stay in bed.
I stepped backwards.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
You should listen to me.
You've been injured before, haven't you?
I finally found a pair of shoes that fit.
How far did it go?
Did I lock the door?
I tried.
I am never free on Sundays.
I've already made it.
Tom's nose was bleeding.
Thank you. "You're welcome."
He will leave for the station an hour before the train leaves.
You'll get there by three o'clock.
Tell us the story from beginning to end.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
It is certain that he is wrong.
I think I've figured out which horse is most likely to win the race.
If you don't like this, you don't have to eat it.
Lemons and limes are acidic fruits.
You forgot your coat.
She's not here to defend herself against these accusations.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
Christmas is fast approaching.
I have been his greatest fan all my life.
I have just what you need.
She used to be a very shy girl.
Are you proud of yourself?
I expect much of him.
I know they'll all want to help you.
Were you at the library yesterday afternoon?
Let's try something.
I didn't want anything.
I hear the phone.
I hope they have a pleasant journey.
I've been looking all over for you.
Make it smaller.
I'm used to it.
They were responsible for the accident.
She was doing the washing then.
She was able to kill two birds with one stone.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
I think that's an exaggeration.
Tom never forgets anything.
I live in a rural area.
She explained to him why she was late.
I knew you would do something great.
I'll send you the bill.
I fell asleep on the train.
You're very brave.
She despises him only because he is poor.
I know Tom has gone.
He will soon be past playing with toys.
I think Tom's here.
Tom changes his password every month.
She spoke through an interpreter.
There's no point in waiting.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
Your face is pale.
A contagious disease descended on the town.
Is that your dog?
I'm still not impressed.
My sister works as a secretary at a bank.
I question your choices.
Tom could've talked to me.
Tom doesn't seem to be aware of the problem.
He told her that she was right.
Why don't you loosen up?
It was a stroke of genius.
Believe what you want.
This is the book I was talking about.
Can you tell me which button to press?
I don't like punk rock.
Have you eaten? "Yes, I have."
Once a bad habit is formed, it is hard to get rid of it.
The snow melted away when spring came.
There are no wrong answers.
The net is huge.
We need to help Tom.
How was your flight?
He just texted me.
The young man lives in an old house.
It's a curse.
It's snowing here.
What's the name of this intersection?
I'm not discouraged.
You're very brave.
How old is your little brother?
It's your life.
It may already be too late for him.
Tom was attacked by a swarm of bees.
What kind of ranch did you grow up on?
An anonymous benefactor bequeathed several hundred thousand dollars to an animal shelter.
The ages of the two children put together was equivalent to that of their father.
I'll never forgive myself.
I like this job.
The earth is far bigger than the moon.
It was yesterday that he went there.
You have to come.
Tom is out with a friend.
No other mountain in Japan is higher than Mt. Fuji.
The station is in the center of the city.
The ocean was calm.
I just don't want any of these.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Do as I told you.
He sounds very immature.
Tom will swim.
I just got a little carried away.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.
We can't do it.
Have you ever been run over?
I hate this town.
I wonder what language they speak in Brazil.
I can't leave.
I don't want to shoot you.
Actually, I'm not quite sure.
Will six o'clock suit you?
It might not be enough.
Tom leads a quiet life.
I want more.
Tom left his wife and children.
People have started arming themselves.
I'm well aware of the dangers.
Tom's nervousness was noticeable.
He is close to sixty.
I often travel.
Are you dating anyone?
He didn't try to answer her back.
Where were you on the night of October 20th?
Tom doesn't have to go if he doesn't want to.
The telephone rang a few minutes later.
It's very kind of you to help me with my homework.
No matter how bad it gets, she won't die from that disease.
I got up too early.
My sister has three times as many books as I do.
Where would you like to go next?
I heard three explosions.
I want to ask you something.
You talk as if you were the boss.
The building collapsed in the earthquake.
Why don't you drop her a line?
The key is on the table.
It's not possible to wait.
The boy took off his clothes and put on his pajamas.
Can we speak French?
He heard his name called.
Bacteria are invisible to the naked eye.
I know it's not possible.
You and I'll be working together.
Can I have your telephone number?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Tom has to go to school.
It's like being in a candy shop.
If you're tired, rest.
Tom is an architect, right?
Tom's adopted.
Do you promise?
Do you know where my recipe book is?
Where's convenient for you?
No amount of training can prepare you for this.
You can see the whole city from this hill.
He seemed to like that.
I was eating dinner then.
Tom lost his memory.
I'm sorry I didn't answer sooner.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
I think that fact is very important.
There's no place like home.
A man appeared at the door.
That is where you are wrong.
May I have the check, please?
Let's find a safe place to hide.
We have a similar predicament.
Tom's password was easy to guess.
My headache has gone.
What an irritating person!
I want each of you to take out a piece of paper and write down what happened.
Can you see it?
I had an amazing experience.
I parked my car behind Tom's.
I guess this wasn't easy for you.
Just ignore it.
I saw a movie for the first time in two years.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
Her mind is filled with dreams of becoming an actress.
It's thanks to his father that he owns this hotel.
These pills come in a blister pack.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
If you stand on this stool, you can reach the top of the closet.
Come meet everybody.
How long have you been out of prison?
Did they live here?
Don't make me suffer.
She told him that she didn't love him.
The two of us are finally alone.
I'll give you a call tomorrow night.
I am ashamed of having been rude to her.
She dumped him for a richer man.
It's more fun than drinking coffee.
As far as I remember, he didn't say that.
My place is with them now.
He's out of practice.
I think your dreams are achievable.
The joke's on us.
That law is full of ambiguities.
Did you volunteer us?
Will that really work?
I have been living in Rio de Janeiro for four years.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
Don't say too much.
Let me give you a preview.
I'm not happy with this.
This is driving me crazy.
Could you hand me the remote?
As I got the train this morning, I met an old friend of mine.
I don't think there's anything we can do.
Let me borrow that.
Why was I not informed?
You should go home now.
He tucked the handkerchief in his pocket.
Please take out the trash.
I'm positive.
He is deeply attached to her.
He had just finished his homework when the clock struck ten.
I think you should reconsider this.
Tom wanted one, but he had no idea where he could get one.
I can look at it when you're ready.
This doesn't make sense to me either.
I couldn't make myself understood well in English.
You're a wonderful guy.
I will go abroad next year.
There are few books without misprints.
She got him a new hat.
She advised him to go to the police station, but he was afraid to.
I don't want Tom to see it.
He cut the meat with a knife.
Do you have the key to this room?
How's your boy doing?
He stopped smoking on his doctor's advice.
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
What time did you wake up?
She is not a fan of winter sports.
The book was better than the movie.
When did the show finish?
Is it bad?
We were there.
Did you accept his invitation?
These are bad times.
You're very generous.
It is he who is to blame.
She couldn't afford it.
Tom lost his hat.
That seems like a good idea.
Where is the railway station?
I can't move my legs.
I was in Tokyo yesterday.
He may not come.
Which car is yours?
She had to speak before a large audience.
I'm happy you're here.
I know Tom is a racist.
I'm dieting.
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
Do you know his brother?
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
Are you sure?
I always catch a cold in the winter.
He is always studying.
He uncorked the bottle.
I have a stomachache.
Wait till six.
It was courteous of him to write a letter of thanks.
She is aggressive.
He won a gold medal.
What do you call your mother?
We hope that you can help us.
My car isn't powerful enough.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
Tom was folding his laundry.
May I call on you at your house tomorrow morning?
Tom has two brothers who live in Boston.
I guess it doesn't make any difference which swimming club I join.
They were playing tennis.
I forgot my credit card at home.
He attributes his success to good luck.
This apple tastes very sour.
They seem to be enjoying themselves.
I've asked you repeatedly not to do that.
Call a plumber.
They've all left.
I don't understand what's bothering you.
How would that help?
I just figured out who you are.
Tom dragged himself out of bed.
I thought you'd like it.
It's a great day for a hike.
Is there a souvenir shop in the hotel?
How could you say that?
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
I should have done this weeks ago.
Who are you and what do you want?
I didn't want to give up.
I know him by name, but not by sight.
Tom is lying on the sofa watching TV.
We go to school by bus.
Years passed.
Let's presume you're right.
We are students.
That can be a problem.
I have a backache.
I'm in debt to my uncle for $10,000.
I thought I might be able to help.
Is Tom living in Boston?
She was busy with her knitting.
I take my hat off to you.
She took a deep breath.
Do you have a showroom for your products in the city?
We're so sorry.
Did you read them?
Come and see me right now.
Somebody saw you.
They trusted you.
We've run out of ammunition.
I have already completed 4 out of 6 tasks on my to-do list today.
The same applies here.
Can anybody else answer?
Can you pitch?
He walked back and forth on the platform while waiting for the train.
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour.
I got what you asked for.
He proposed an alternate plan.
Why is the dog here?
Please sit down for a moment.
What's your favorite drink in the summer?
The workers worked around the clock.
The shop was busy.
Do you like Boston?
She is a very nice person.
Do as you want.
The island is a paradise for children.
Get rid of them.
He lived alone in the countryside.
You're not dressed.
I've never seen such a large whale.
You are taller than me.
How can we get past this crisis?
What's the name of the company you work for?
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Think of what you are reading while you are reading it.
I was careful not to say anything to make him angry.
Are they going to arrest Tom?
I doubled over with laughter.
I don't need your charity.
I'll be there in five minutes.
She is powerful.
What do you think you'll do with your life?
How many have you had?
What kind of songs are popular these days?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I expect to sing better next time.
Give my regards to your family.
Has your dog ever bitten you?
His career is on the line.
Don't you think I know what people say about me?
They're coming.
You're funny.
There's no need to go to school today.
A treatment will cure the disease.
I paid for these tickets.
We talked on the way home.
I know you're not going to come to my party, but I wish you were.
Please don't nitpick just for the sake of nitpicking.
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you sooner.
My wife will be glad to see you, too.
I want to know what's in this box.
I run my own business.
He fired most of his men.
We're both wrong.
Whether the problem is important or unimportant, you must solve it.
I don't want to go to bed yet.
We are looking forward to seeing you soon.
My neighbor is nice.
Tom seemed to think so, too.
Are you being serious?
The girl went to school in spite of her illness.
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
What a beautiful house!
Tom is studying in Boston.
Each member has to pay a membership fee.
Your hair is pretty.
A moat surrounds the castle.
Can I be of any service to you?
Let's look at the facts.
We're both teachers.
You should've said so earlier.
They just want an excuse to fire you.
A good idea occurred to him.
Your death will not have been in vain.
Let's get divorced.
I had to do everything on my own.
Let's do it again.
He is always neatly dressed.
Tom watched Mary cook dinner.
She patted me on the shoulder.
What was he doing there?
This is the end.
Don't lose heart now.
He appealed to us for help.
You can't eat soup with a fork.
We finally struck a bargain.
He cured my illness.
That's an excellent choice.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
He's wanted for grand theft auto.
I want to be alone for a while.
We can't keep this up for much longer.
It is rather warm today.
Do I look tired?
Everyone was speechless.
She was superstitious, as the people of that period usually were.
She forgave him for losing all her money.
Where did you hear that?
I'll be with you in a second.
Do you like Moscow?
I slept with my clothes on.
I'd like us to be friends again.
I got fined.
I seem to be lost.
My uncle lives near the school.
Don't you get it?
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Smoking is forbidden here.
How about running?
Will he be here soon?
How could Tom have done that?
I was in charge.
I've decided to learn shorthand.
I can't stop coughing.
Keep an eye on it.
I don't like to wear shoes without socks.
We have a bit of time now.
We got to the station at six.
I know where we are.
She has left her umbrella behind.
I'm supposed to go.
Why would I want to go there alone?
I need another three hundred dollars.

Everybody makes mistakes. That's why they put erasers on pencils.

I will give it a try.
There is nothing wrong with this.
I think the wind's dropping off.
The silver is on the table.
Sorry to trouble you.
Don't forget that.
Is there somewhere we can talk privately about this?
I run a tight ship.
The car doesn't start.
Give me a hand with this.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
I'm very modest.
It may be our only hope.
Before you go to visit him, you should make sure he's at home.
Tom bought some vegetables and fruit.
Do not disturb her.
I want my money back now.
I want you all out of here.
What a fool I was to lend him the money.
That sounds really interesting.
I know Tom will be fair.
It was not at all funny.
He showed us his mother's picture.
First, let's talk about Tom.
Are you hurt?

There's a yellow rose.
It's about time you went to school.
I went shopping at that department store.
I didn't know you had hay fever.
We won't have time to help you today.
I assume so.
Do you want to use mine?
I know how busy you've been.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
I hope you're having fun.
She took me by surprise.
It feels weird, doesn't it?
I don't know which of you is older.
Tom has denied the allegation.
I got home a little late last night.
I wish you'd talk to me.
Newly printed books smell good.
Please show it to me again.
That was sweet.
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
May I ask why it is that you don't want to talk about it?
I understand this.
This is not necessary.
That flower has a powerful smell.
Someday I'll buy a cotton candy machine.

They formed a circle.
Are you actually threatening me?
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me.
Tom was found guilty.
I work in Milan.
It's always been that way.
We don't have to go.
I no longer have any reason to do this.
He can't be smart if he can screw up something like that.

I don't have any problems at all.
Are you gonna help me or what?
I've never heard of that.
I hate paperwork.
Did I miss the turn?
I kind of like this place.
Nothing is perfect.
I hid myself behind the couch.
I don't know who made the cake.
Tom gets up early in the morning.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.

I signed the check.
You can't do it too soon.

Don't let them see you're afraid.
Wake me up at eight.
He went on singing.
I know you're hiding somewhere in this room.
I always keep my promises.
Are you sure this isn't going to hurt?
Feel free to call me if you need anything.
I lied on my job application.
I'm glad to see you're finally happy.

That's not how I want things to be.

Can I have two hamburgers and a coke, please?
Everybody's in position.
Tom didn't understand Mary's joke.
Here is your dog.
I know Tom is a little shy.
If you need help, just ask.
Are you afraid of the dark?
Love your neighbors.
What are you waiting for?
He knows everything.
Let me finish.
He's not smart enough to add numbers in his head.
The boss just chewed him out again.
Have you ever kissed a boy?
It's not that different.

English is not easy, but it is interesting.
All this bickering is starting to fray my nerves.
I did all I could.
It's all very simple.
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen.
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
She didn't say a word to me all night.
He wants something more.
I saw a black cat run into the house.
He can be counted on.

It really was hard.
She's waiting for you at home.
What are you going to do with this money?

I just don't want to be disappointed again.
I'm going to learn French.
Where did you get your camera repaired?
I don't agree.

Do you have psychic powers?
You don't want to do anything rash.
I'm trying to save money.

Could I talk to the two of you alone?
This clock isn't working.

She came to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese.
How long were you at the party?
It's dirty work.
She's not a child.
Make good use of your time.
Tom told me you were afraid.
He became a citizen of the United States.
Tom wasn't my husband.
Do you know where your children are?
Call off your dogs.
You'd better not go.
I wish he were on our team.
Are you quite certain about it?
There is an urgent need for a new approach to dealing with this problem.
I accept your challenge.
She wore a beautiful dress.
There is a bridge over the pond.
I've just eaten so I'm not hungry.
I tried to help him.
The storm has died down.
I just want what's best for you.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
You're too suspicious about everything.
That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?
I'm going to fly to the moon.
Is this your wallet?
I can read.
They're right behind me.
I hear something.
It was white.
Here is a list of moderately priced restaurants.
She laughed so hard she cried.
They're dead.
I bought this at a flea market for three dollars.
Wake up!
Let's not panic.
You can't drive now. You've been drinking.

I don't like being cheated.
I heard someone scream.
He went to the store to buy some oranges.
Do you know French?
She thanked him for all his help.
I left my passport somewhere.
The situation got out of their control.
I think Tom is reliable.
I think it's time for me to retire.
He's Swiss.
Do you have any Japanese beer?
It's a pity that you can't come.
I feel lonely when you're not here.
However hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can.
Mr. Jackson is our homeroom teacher.
People say that life is short.
You want something from me, don't you?
Japan's foreign aid is decreasing in part because of an economic slowdown at home.
That's very kind of you.
I called them.
I wouldn't recommend that.
Would you mind waiting a minute?
I want you to get started right away.
We put sugar in our tea.
Neither one of them disagrees.
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
She forced him to sit down.
I stayed at Tom's house in Boston.
I'm in no hurry to leave.
I'm saving money for a car.
That should be enough.
You're a bad liar.
You're just like your father.
Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late for lunch.
It was a busy night.
My father gets up early.
Don't bother doing that now.
We all want to go home.
I just did what you told me to do.
Can I see this one?
That was, as it were, part of the job.
Tom burst out laughing.
He wants an apple.
It fell to pieces.
I want to buy a cheap dictionary.
I must help my mother.
That has nothing to do with him.
Who's your French teacher?
You can't just make everyone do what you want them to.
He has three older sisters.
I need somebody I can trust.
When the curtain went up, the stage was dark.
I like to read before going to sleep.
We have two children.
You were hot, weren't you?
You're in grave danger.
I know how we can make a lot of money.
Maybe he likes you, too.
I can't imagine a world without electricity.
Are you ready to party?
I promise it won't take long.
I don't think I can keep that promise.
I know that this is strange.
My opinion doesn't really matter.
I don't have any friends.
What he said is irrelevant to the matter.
I pay my own way.
I've always wanted to try it.
Where should I put it?
Here's the answer to your question.
He asked me to do it.
Leave my family alone.
This is not something I am proud of.
I didn't know Tom had agreed to do that.
You weren't even there.
He put his hand to his forehead.
I just can't figure it out.
Maybe I'll buy a bike.
Maybe it's true.
I'm thankful for my family.
Tom smiled politely.
I really am glad you're here.
He lives far away from my house.
It is getting more and more difficult to make a living.
I haven't eaten for days.
I'll do it.
This is not a sentence.
She used to go mountain climbing with him.
It's not done yet.
You remind me of your father.
That'll remain our secret.
I need to lose a little weight.
Where did you have your new suit made?
If I had known about your illness, I could have visited you in the hospital.
There's no exit.
You might be the only one who can do that.
American kitchens are much bigger than Japanese ones.
How did we do that?
They were disappointed that you could not come.
It's been a terrible day.
Native Americans fought with bow and arrow.
If we'd taken that plane, we'd be dead now.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
I don't remember you at all.
Tom is in a state of shock.
How do you feel about the proposed changes?
The only time my son talks to me is when he needs some money.
Are you in Boston?
Get out of there.
Just tell Tom to leave me alone.
I don't take bribes.
How are you?
I'm more than happy.
I've only had two boyfriends. "Oh, I have two boyfriends right now."
Aren't you satisfied?
I love my home.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
Why would you do that without telling us?
Tom's important.
I cooked dinner.
This rug was made without the use of child labor.
She looks young, but actually she's older than you are.
He plays tennis three times a week.
She was surprised at his appearance.
I never laid a finger on her.
I had to see you.
Tom lost control of the car.
What's your favorite free software application?
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was in the haunted house.
That's your choice.
How can it be done?
Don't just stand there, say something.
I don't need to talk to you.
He pulled the wounded soldier to the nearby bush.
It's dishonest.
How come I've never seen you here before?
Take what you want.
I wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
It's going to be a challenge.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Where did everybody go?
This shouldn't be happening.
They won't have a chance.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
She gave him a big smile.
She asked me about my mother.
I will choose one.
I'm going to ask for a new desk.
It seemed like a good idea.
I felt myself lifted up.
He did it in front of the staff.
One more bottle of wine, please.
I know what Tom and Mary are capable of.
This was part of the plan.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
Is it really possible to do a brain transplant?
Tom works all night.
You look relaxed.
Did she go to the station to see her teacher off?
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
It's not just a game.
I'm at school now.
The nail tore his jacket.
Some of them are teachers.
What do announcers do?
Wait just a moment.
You three are very lucky.
Are you through with the newspaper?
She is crying.
Only God can help you now.
Can I buy only the lenses?
Smoking is permitted.
No one here has a car.
Tom didn't like French class very much.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I'll be in the attic.
I let you catch me.
You can't both be right.
My glass is full.
That's why he got up early.
She felt like dancing.
Tom should really study French.
Do you want to go shopping with me?
Tom doesn't think he'll be able come tomorrow.
You've got a pretty good memory.
I took my temperature every six hours.
I unfolded the map on the desk.
When was it finished?
My father doesn't like soccer.
Tom is determined to lose weight.
She refused my invitation.
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
Dr. Smith has a lot of patients.
Tom cleaned his room before dinner.
How long did I sleep?
I beg you to help us.
We sat on the grass.
The laws were very difficult to enforce.
I use it every day.
I wanted to show it to you.
How would they know what to do?
Enjoy yourself for a change.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
Check these out.
He felt the same way as I did.
Tom was surprised by Mary's reaction.
You can't blame this on us.
Disable the alarm.
Please don't tell anyone.
Are you finished reading the paper?
Are you all ready?
The car he's driving is not his.
All of them died.
Tom doesn't have enough money to buy everything he needs.
The traffic was bad.
Tom folded his sheets.
I want to buy another one.
She's in total denial about her husband's philandering.
What were we supposed to do?
Everybody likes polite people.
I think Tom really deserves it.
I absolutely must know what you're planning to do.
Did you get my email yesterday with the instructions?
I think you're nuts.
My car is out of gas.
You don't get it, do you?
Where are the guns?
If you eat three square meals a day, your body will have the energy it needs.
The hard rain spoiled our hike through the woods.
Tom wanted to ask Mary how old she was, but he thought that maybe he shouldn't.
You're a hundred percent right.
Some people don't eat meat.
This story is too predictable.
Wait until your father gets home.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
Tom has a soft voice.
That movie is exciting.
Ask anyone.
Anyone home?
You're very upset.
On the rocks, please.
Is everybody having a good time?
He started to cry.
She visited him on October 20th.
You despise Tom, don't you?
Doing that would be a mistake.
I just moved.
Go to bed.
Could we take you somewhere else?
We had a real good time.
Did you do it?
They come from the same village.
I can do without his help.
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
It would be best if you didn't do that.
Why are you so mean?
The girl entered the room.
I stole it from Tom.
Dad knows what he's doing.
Should we make the suggested changes?
I like that answer.
Give me your money!
We can do it right now.
I want a new kitchen.
All I want is your love.
Don't you want to know what I want?
You should have told him.
I'm anxious about the future.
I thought we had found the perfect hiding place, but the police found us.
The police want to question you.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
Get out of our house.
It's all a big joke.
Is everything satisfactory?
Am I dreaming?
Have you ever had a near death experience?
I'd like a cup of tea, please.
He could not send his son to school.
She fainted.
He's been teaching for 20 years.
What do you regret most?
I hated you at first.
They don't want you to know.
Traveling was much more difficult in those days.
I can look at it when you're ready.
He is suspected of robbery.
Tom doesn't smile often.
We're not family.
Lychees taste of grapes.
Are you ready to fly?
What are you going to do tonight?
Do you believe in reincarnation?
I was able to accomplish a lot today.
As far as I am concerned, I have no objection.
I'm not interested at all.
Thanks for the heads-up.
We were surprised to hear the news.
This is a lot more fun than studying.
Are you drinking?
How may I help you?
I'll peel an orange for you.
She's been severely traumatized by bullying at school.
Get control of yourself.
We left nothing to chance.
The girl cried out for help.
I need a little company.
Have you figured out the cost?
You're really awesome.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
We're making a big mistake.
Tom traveled a lot.
This book is much more interesting than that one.
Will you go?
I'm tired of listening to your bragging.
You'd better hurry.
I'm staying at a hotel for the time being.
I'd like to ask one or two questions myself.
I'll never be able to do that without your help.
It's not clear when he came here.
There is no reason why I should go there.
I don't even know your real name.
My dad bought me books.
I don't think that's the solution.
Pretend you're me.
Who did you go with?
I don't like hitchhiking.
I can't understand what happened.
You may not be as lucky next time.
Why don't you take the day off?
I'll wait for you.
It is not good to laugh at others.
I assumed it was free.
I have lost my pencil.
I'm going to miss you.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
I appreciate your trying to protect me.
I'm sure that this is a fresh water fish.
Where are you going to go?
Both he and I are high school students.
I want to show you something in my office.
She looked up at him.
The tall man wore a pink carnation in his lapel.
They'll never make it.
I'm sure I can find something for you to do.
He tried to make his wife happy, but in vain.
You don't seem too sure.
He's after me.
We need you to be strong.
I'll take your word for it.
We're not turning back.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
I have a few easy questions for you.
Are you serious about getting married?
I feel more alert after drinking a cup of coffee.
I heard that Tom and Mary got back together.
Do you like that?
I know Tom is miserable.
Tom took a step backwards.
We have suppliers.
Mary is Tom's mother.
I still don't have enough money to buy that.
I didn't want Tom to help me.
Is there something in particular that you want to know?
The decision was easy to make.
They're right behind me.
She was promoted.
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.
Our teacher likes his new car.
I'm tired of all this nagging.
I thought you'd be pleased.
You won't be interested.
That looks like tea.
He is a type of a person who calls a spade a spade.
Where are the knives?
I think you're funny.
That sounds a lot easier to do than it is.
Can you help me make a snowman?
Tom is a slow walker.
He held his breath.
We have the opportunity to make some changes.
I want to say this the right way.
I just couldn't stay away.
We are not going on vacation.
Relax a moment.
I'm really concerned about your future.
Only my mother really understands me.
You should choose a job in relation to your talents and interests.
Do you know who that person is?
How did you come by this painting?
Tom was my role model.
He's too drunk.
I knew that Tom was hungry.
I want to do some bass fishing, but I don't know what to use for bait.
Tom told me to be more careful.
I couldn't think of anything better than that.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I knew you'd mess things up.
Luckily, we have a plan.
Mary brought her daughter to work.
A fire broke out on the second floor.
I don't want your money.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
What are you cooking?
Whenever I see this, I remember him.
Funny, I don't remember that.
What is the cat up to?
I have almost no appetite.
She had a headache from lack of sleep.
Everything should be in order.
The man did not so much as apologize for stepping on my foot.
Why were 14,000 soldiers lost?
Don't make me hurt you again.
What are you preparing?
Tom had never told anyone but Mary.
It's hard to choose.
Watch out for the car!
You're cuter than Mary.
It's only temporary.
Come and get it.
He wouldn't look at my proposal.
I'd like to make a reservation for next Monday.
He's young and healthy.
Tom is waiting in room three.
Are you actually serious?
Liars must have a good memory.
Are you thinking of going to university?

He told me just the opposite!
What's the point of your question?
I should go with you.
There's a lot of furniture in the room.
Three of the hostages have been released.
Don't worry about your family.
Tom just confessed.
He turned over in bed.
I really don't want to go out on a date with Mary.
We can't do that yet.
We take risks all the time.
I can't believe I didn't think of it.
I haven't gotten over my bad cold yet.
Some Americans joined the Communist Party.
I'm in my apartment.
The two candidates are neck and neck.
Have you read any good books lately?
This guy is great.
I want to warn you.
It's night.
You're clever.
Please be careful.
They finished their meal.
All the villagers know of the accident.
That shirt doesn't go with the pants.
I think you might be overreacting.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I can't believe I said that.
I want to try it.
That's a possible explanation.
I got years of experience in courtrooms.
Carrots are good for the eyesight.
She advised him to stop working so much.
Women in that country are fighting for their freedom.
There was a large audience in the concert hall.
They'll never make it.
What would the world do without tea?
Are you proud of yourself?
I know a better way to do that.
There is an urgent need for improved living conditions.
Don't forget to take your medication.
You can't believe a word he says.
They have everything they need.
He is married to an American lady.
I'd like to look like Tom.
Don't tell me what I know.
Tom wanted to turn over a new leaf.
I'd like you to read this book.
He told the truth.
Don't open your books.
The bus stop is across the street.
Are you enjoying it?
No one heard anything.
I retired in 2013.
He entered the room on tiptoes.
We live in an apartment.
I envy you.
I don't know what to do or what to say.
I have lost my watch.
It's not all bad.
Please contact me by letter.
I am familiar with this part of town.
Tom never sings in public.
They drank two bottles of wine.
Tom tore the paper in half.
Bring a shovel.
What would cause that?
I was bored with his old jokes.
Tom asked Mary not to do anything.
He has big hands.
I erased the blackboard for the teacher.
He knows nothing about politics.
My wife is a good manager.
The weather was perfect yesterday.
Make a wish and blow out the candles.
He has promised never to be late again.
What's up?
I'm calm.
Are you kidding?
Clean that up.
Tom and Mary were always fighting.
It's very dark.
What with the heat and the humidity, I didn't sleep well.
Tom still owes me a lot of money.
I don't believe in astrology, but that doesn't mean that I don't read my horoscope.
I love you, Tom.
Do you see what I mean?
I persuaded her to make herself comfortable.
I'd like three of these.
Did you meet her?
They forced me out.
He is seeking employment.
The rain shows no sign of stopping.
Let go of my arm!
Tom fell over and landed flat on his face.
It wasn't much of a storm.
He likes coffee without sugar.
Let him go.
Once you've started something, don't give it up.
Which film did you see?
If you need a ride, I could come and get you.
He is busy doing something.
I didn't have enough space to fit my lunch in the bag.
I'll tell Tom the truth when the time comes.
We receive many telephone calls from abroad.
What don't you like?
It took me only three hours to do that.
I'll wait until tomorrow night.
Why don't you stick around for a few minutes?
You're just like your mother.
Where do you want these suitcases?
Tom doesn't even live in Boston.
Tom is apparently a truck driver.
I just don't want you to get upset.
I have difficulty in understanding him.
Let's go outside and sit in the garden.
It seems too good to be true.
Tom and Mary both work full time.
She spoke to me with a smile.
Have you ever spoken to Tom in French?
I thought I heard you.
This is red wine.
I can't just not do anything.
Are you sure of it?
Maybe he has lots of girlfriends.
Give me another couple of days to think it over.
Tom asked Mary to come to his office.
Why don't you run for student council?
It's raining again!
That's what I thought you said.
Are you sure you can handle this?
An important function of policemen is to catch thieves.
If I can do it, so can you.
Every member of the cabinet was present.
I don't know English.
This is your fate.
A girl gave me an orange in exchange for a piece of cake.
I've got it all.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Tom is unbelievable.
I just brewed a pot.
Where do you all come from?
All you have to do is follow me.
There is no wind today.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
He seemed really nervous.
I'd like to leave the city and rediscover nature.
Doctors have made great strides in their fight against cancer.
We need to talk.
We can travel together.
I look forward to hearing you sing tonight.
I don't need your money. I just need your time.
Maybe you should just leave Tom alone.
I want to buy something to eat.
How much money do you want?
You don't need to do that anymore.
He's been doing this for over twenty years.
We went skiing in Canada.
She had a choice of going or remaining.
Run for it!
Three people are still missing.
We need to buy a new washing machine.
Quit behaving like a kid.
We're sure that it was an accident.
I know the drill.
I'm often told I don't look good in a skirt.
Tell me why I shouldn't fire you.
You won't go, will you?
He sold us out.
What are some foods you usually eat with a knife and fork?
Tom kissed his cousin.
Tom said he'd like to see Mary do that.
He had to call on all his experience to carry out the plan.
I'm going out for a while.
I've lost all my money.
I'm correcting my mistakes.
She is no less charming than her sister.
Tom didn't want to talk to anyone.
Everyone knows we're rich.
I'm impatient.
I was angry at myself.
Did she like it?
Your marriage is in trouble.
I'd rather live in peaceful poverty than in wealth and fear.
Give me a minute to catch my breath.
The warnings were ignored.
After his accident, he is happy to be alive.
Do you wear a kimono?
You must reboot your computer.
The dogs started barking.
I remember many things.
Tom seems really happy to be here.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
I was leaving home when Tom telephoned me.
It's ready.
We have broken off relations with them.
It varies a great deal.
Tom has a son named John.
You're so naive.
Who knows what he'll accomplish if given the chance?
Where in Australia are you from?
They are eating their apples.
You've got to be kidding me!
Her car broke down on the way.
I'm not sure that's suitable.
Last month he had his house painted white.
To our surprise, she has gone to Brazil alone.
Eventually, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself.
I've got a friend who works for the New York Times.
Tom never really trusted Mary.
That could be anything.
He thinks he can prove it.
I don't want anything happening to you.
Tom and Mary voted for John.
He was not able to open the box.
I like reading American novels.
Tell Tom about what you did the other night.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Black smoke spewed out of the third-story windows.
The unclaimed items were sold off at auction.
How do you know that it's his?
I'm right behind Tom.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
She's very beautiful.
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I'd like to ask you about a student of yours.
I can't live without my cat.
Should I go?
It's almost six.
That house needs repainting.
Why don't you love me?
I remember them.
Back off!
I should've known it was going to be a waste of time.
I went to school.
Girls are crazy.
Let's do it.
You're not alone.
I never saw him again.
I need to get something.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
The wall is covered with graffiti.
You should do something you enjoy doing.
They are very proud of being students of that college.
I forgot my glasses.
This is my umbrella, not Tom's.
It seemed to work.
I'm the only one you can trust.
Let me go alone.
You're so impatient.
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
You should have been more prudent.
I had a great teacher.
It made sense.
Why are you alone?
I don't have that kind of money.
Tom didn't tell Mary he couldn't speak French.
I want to kiss Tom.
You're afraid of me, aren't you?
I've got to get home.
My parents never let me do anything.
I prefer going out to staying at home.
Take as long as you need.
He runs in the park every day.
Neither of my parents is still living.
I won't give them to you.
He spoke of the people and the things that he had seen during his trip.
It's been a good day.
My father doesn't eat fruit that much.
How come you know so much?
I have one brother.
Just keep moving.
I made him open the door.
You're totally ignorant.
Tom left me.
I know I can count on every one of you.
My explanation was not sufficient.
I don't need an office.
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday.
Put some clothes on.
Are you waiting for Tom?
Father often helps me with my homework.
I was like you once.
Is it reliable?
Pass me the salt and pepper, please.
It's nice to be back home.
Tom is boring, isn't he?
I'm faithful to my wife.
The fuse has blown.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
We have plenty of time.
I'd advise doing that.
I'm not going to name names.
I'm still studying French.
Why don't you stay there?
I'll try to find one.
No one left.
Tom didn't get in until after 2:30 this morning.
I'm not going to explain it to you.
Is Tom there?
I need to do something else first.
I returned the knife which I had borrowed.
I'd like to go abroad one day.
Try to hold it together.
His hobbies are playing the guitar and singing.
Pass me the butter, please.
You are always welcome.
He has a swelling on his head.
May I borrow your lighter?
I know Tom quite well.
Why wasn't I informed earlier?
You'd do the same thing if you were me.
Never speak ill of others.
Nobody understands.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
In his free time, he likes to be on the Internet.
Did you think of that?
I have two or three calls lined up for today.
I played tennis with Tom.
They'll be here tonight.
Are you through with the paper?
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is hurt you.
It's really cold.
This summer we'll go to the mountains and to the sea.
I did that very carefully.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
He always talks as though he were addressing a public meeting.
You're forgetful.
Tom hid under the table.
Would you mind if I ate a piece of this pie?
Is it really all over?
His pessimism depressed those around him.
Could you gift wrap it?
I want to ask you some questions.
We shouldn't even consider doing that.
I really wanted to go.
He doesn't play video games.
I would rather feed my dog before we eat.
Do you think it's dangerous for me to swim across the river?
Can I get you something to drink?
This is your wine.
Tom lived half his life in Boston.
We need Tom's experience.
He is well off.
Do you have any foreign books?
Jump as high as you can.
I was unable to go outside.
I think you might need my help.
How can you be so cruel?
I knew Tom would accept my invitation.
He stuck to his promise.
Who was the book written by?
Is Tom doing okay?
Would you like some more tea?
All you have to do is ask him to pay the debt.
I am truly sorry.
She likes to arrange flowers.
You won't go, will you?
The weather turned better.
We can't satisfy everyone.
I know about that.
I was born there.
He was the last person to arrive.
That's not what you said before.
I can solve the problem by myself.
I bought them each a present.
Every year, Hawaii moves ten centimeters closer to Japan.
I have to go to the office.
In what month were you born?
Would you like to have tea with us this afternoon?
How do you respond to that?
A storm kept the ship from leaving Kobe.
How many languages are there in the world?
I think that we should try again.
Crows are black.
Let me think for a while.
How about playing catch? "Sure, why not?"
I suppose it was a bit silly.
Is he dead?
We don't really know anything about death.
Where's the rest?
You should exercise.
We did nothing wrong. It was only a kiss.
It went viral.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Are you ready now?
Tom was in almost every picture in Mary's album.
Open the window, will you?
You don't look so busy.
I helped Tom.
That probably is true.
I must decline.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
They are arguing.
People can easily tell the difference between them.
We've been invited to a costume party.
You'll be better soon.
Why do I get the feeling I'm not going to like this?
I called ahead.
We are not too young to tell what love is like.
Photography is now considered a new form of art.
It's better you don't know.
I went to Kobe by train.
I love that movie.
Are you saying my life is in danger?
Tom has more money than he needs.
The man sitting next to me spoke to me.
Tom should never have borrowed money from Mary.
I planted a tree.
I hope it wasn't too boring.
I would love to go to the dance with you. "Really? You would?"
Are you sure you have to leave?
I want everybody to go home.
You're early.
If only I'd been a couple of years older, they would've let me into the bar.
I just listened and kept quiet.
I'm trying to stop Tom.
I'm sure we all agree.
Let's get down to brass tacks and talk business.
He repeated his question.
French isn't my native language.
We must attack.
Does your dog bite?
He was lonely after his divorce.
Have you put on sunscreen?
How big you are!
Do you like tea or coffee?
Is this a river?
I enforce the rules even though I don't agree with them all.
I got the news from a reliable source.
I beg your pardon?
I knew Tom wasn't a bully.
They let me go.
The natives saw an airplane then for the first time.
Tom, don't die.
What are your impressions?
I am afraid of death.
He was angry because I wouldn't give him any help.
Handle this very carefully.
That's just how I am.
My sister and I went to the castle.
We don't know what it is.
There is a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
That might not be possible.
He is ashamed of his failure.
He took a coin out of his pocket.
We respect Tom a lot.
Who's going to pay for that?
I'm well aware of the risk.
You don't know how much I wanted to do that.
Is he seriously ill? "I hope not."
Why would you want to do that?
I caught them in the act.
Many thanks.
I wish I had a little more time to finish this.
That sounds really great.
Tom bought a Chinese-Japanese dictionary.
Grab hold of this.
I do that every week.
I want an hourly update about what's happening.
I think Tom died.
Come alone.
The outcome depends entirely on your own efforts.
I have three times as many books as Tom.
I haven't done this in ages.
She's not invited to parties.
The dog was hit by a truck.
Even Tom thinks so.
I'm not a professional.
She seems to be nervous about her first class.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Don't do that. You're making Tom cry.
They went crazy.
You've got to be reasonable about this.
What movie did you see?
He became more and more famous.
Is the school on this side of the river?
He doesn't study as hard as he used to.
That's a very beautiful painting.
Tom is a friend of mine.
Your sister's sleeping.
I'm not sure if I'm stupid or not.
He ran through the streets naked.
I haven't eaten French food since I left France.
If he studied hard, he would pass the test.
There is no shame in being poor.
I was as surprised as you.
Can you solve this problem?
They want the best.
Do you need a spoon?
Does anyone here speak Japanese?
Buildings are much stronger now than they used to be.
We ran in the park.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
You seem really busy this morning.
If two people are in agreement, one of them is unnecessary.
My sister is a nurse.
Why didn't you read the magazine?
I love you just the way you are.
We shouldn't confuse solitude with isolation. They are two separate things.
Next, I'd like to sing a song I wrote.
I was really surprised.
He carved me a wooden doll.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
I'm not sure I can trust him.
She likes music. "So do I."
Does someone have the exact time, please?
I have enclosed your order form.
Do you have a bank account?
After I finished my homework, I watched baseball on TV.
Do you think you could stop doing that?
We live in a big city.
They're brave.
We were passengers.
Is this all they do?
There's always a first time for everything.
At any rate, I must finish this work by tomorrow.
Where do you live?
She is herself again.
How'd you get that shiner?
At the moment you're in no condition to drive.
I like reading.
She robbed me blind.
This week I had three midterms.
It's not about that.
They're cute.
How's this possible?
Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
I missed a step on the stairs and I'm afraid I sprained my ankle.
I never learned to drive.
This isn't enough.
Tom told me he checked the oil level.
I don't understand what this means at all.
It's the story of a boy, a girl, and a cat.
It is hard for an old man to change his way of thinking.
We're done.
He has a sufficient income to support his family.
Stay right here.
You didn't miss the meeting.
This product is well-designed.
I'll wait like the rest of you.
How do they expect us to survive?
I'm sick of fighting.
I teach French.
How often do you see him?
This may just come in handy someday.
Tom is here, right?
This made me sad.
I'm too sleepy to do my homework.
You can't pretend this didn't happen.
Please stop.
Do you see anything?
I appreciated it.
Tom began putting on his shoes.
Please be careful.
We need to get away from here.
I wanted to be a farmer.
A computer is a complex machine.
Our dog is in the kennel.
You'd make a good private detective.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
No one got sick.
Don't speak with your mouth full.
Let me explain the rules.
Turn down the television.
The buildings look so tiny.
Where would you like to go next?
You have only to touch the button.
I don't want any more problems.
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
The plane made a perfect landing.
Did you go out last night?
When were you thinking of coming back to the States?
I have to put my shoes on.
I'm sorry to hear it.
Tell me this isn't true.
There's no mistaking about that.
I'm surprised to see you.
I don't talk about you behind your back.
You're messing with me, right?
This is no time for modesty.
He acts as if he were a king.
The sea is blue.
I tried to tell you this before.
I will go if you go.
Stay here.
The city was soon occupied by the soldiers.
You don't need to worry anymore.
There are plenty of fish in this river.
Have fun, but don't get lost.
Some people questioned his honesty.
I don't want anything more.
I filled in the blanks.
Last week she gave birth to a beautiful daughter.
Can you hear us?
The gown is made of silk.
I just bought a boat.
I lost your number.
She persuaded him to do it.
I'd say you're jealous.
Why are you in such a bad mood?
I'm going to go to Australia next year.
You aren't smiling.
I have things I want to do.
He doesn't take vacations.
Help yourself to the cake.
Give me back my hat.
I am fed up with his vulgar jokes.
They set to work at once.
She showed up at the party looking like a million dollars.
Pardon me, what's the name of this place?
Sorry, I don't understand.
His grandmother looks healthy.
I have some very bad news.
How will I know if I'm wrong?
I felt like such an idiot.
I shook hands with Tom and left.
You are entitled to your opinion.
A loophole in the law allowed him to escape prosecution.
I didn't know it before.
I don't think that's the whole story.
They mistook him for his brother.
You should have consulted me first.
My father works in a factory.
Do it again!
You're grounded.
Don't tell me who I like.
How can this work?
He went there instead of me.
I am looking for room with twin beds.
I can understand that.
Talk to me.
I'll come as soon as possible.
You're too old for me.
I will go and take a look at the house.
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.
That guy is totally nuts!
I know you're upset.
Tom understands.
I'll go check.
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
Tom is always here.
She took a pen out of her pocket.
They let me go.
No one knows where we are.
Any of you can do it.
She turned her back to me.
There's a little bit of water in the glass.
What did you eat for lunch today?
He enjoys wandering around the forest in his spare time.
The barn was struck by lightning.
That's what I usually do.
Who is your teacher?
I just wanted to see what would happen.
I swim three or four times a week.
Tom died from food poisoning.
I see fear in your eyes.
Don't say that.
I'm emotionally drained.
How many years did it take to build the pyramids?
I bought her some drinks.
That's a tough question to answer.
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
The train leaves at nine.
Please turn out the light so that I can sleep.
You're arrogant.
I will obey.
He is drunk.
I didn't tell you everything.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
I'm sure everything's OK.
I was burned.
It's all over for us.
I didn't even get a postcard.
He promised me that he won't tell anybody.
We have to warn him.
Tom wants to know if it hurts.
I had never heard anyone speak of him before.
Are you able to swim well?
A number of passengers were injured.
Where do you think you're going?
Ethics is a branch of philosophy.
You're not the only woman here.
Can I have a hug?
Tell them who you are.
You're kidding!
I just want to tell Tom something.
You're not bruised.
Everyone is more or less interested in art.
You're not allowed to park here.
He trusted you.
You have to tell me what to do.
What's that picture inside your locker?
This is totally worthless.
You don't have a fever.
I don't know anything about riding horses.
Could you drive more slowly?
I made these.
He put his hand gently on her shoulder.
I think this translation is incorrect.
I pay most of my bills on the first of each month.
I don't feel like eating now.
Let's split the bill.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
I feel like I'm going mad.
It might be a shark.
You should be very proud of yourself.
Your car's on fire.
Don't breathe a word of this to my girlfriend.
You spilled your coffee.
She is familiar with Japanese history.
See below.
What's wrong with you?
Give us a moment.
Nothing is strange.
I've finally made a decision.
He wiped the sweat from his face.
Just answer the question.
If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
I need you right now.
You're fascinating.
I want you to find out.
You probably just want to be alone.
We've got a bigger problem.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
I hate silent movies.
Please permit me to ask you some questions.
She was looking forward to playing table tennis with him.
We went to the beach.
How often do you see him?
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've got a small problem.
I hate them all.
We obeyed the rules.
How is your daughter?
I was asked by my uncle what I intended to be when I graduated from college.
Are you here to spy on me?
My father knows your mother very well.
It's ridiculous.
Let me repair it.
Environmental changes gave rise to new species.
Mary likes to wear clothes with vertical stripes, because she heard they make you look thinner.
All graduates are invited.
What do you like?
He looked around.
When you're in a hurry, it's easy to make a mistake.
It's very kind of you to say so.
You're very emotional.
I remember when it happened.
Let's get to know each other.
She hates fish and never eats any.
Tom is a very influential man.
They're weak.
You can't really blame Tom for that.
What're you looking for?
I turned on the lights.
How unlucky I am!
How many people were at your party?
Is something else going on here?
How are you feeling?
Have you ever written a computer program?
They seem happy.
He wouldn't even look at me.
She seems to have a tendency to exaggerate things.
I still think Tom is hiding something.
Tom means a lot to me.
It's a big city.
Stop what you're doing.
How many people are in your crew?
Why didn't you call me last night?
It is impossible to resolve the conflict.
Am I under suspicion?
I want something to eat.
I have good news for you.
I wanted Tom to help me.
He may not have known the formula.
Where are you all going?
I understand the risks.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Don't kid yourself.
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
I don't intend to answer any questions.
Tom abandoned his family.
Would you kindly make room for this old woman?
You're perfectly right.
I need more power.
I figured you weren't coming.
I don't really want to go there by myself.
He is her friend.
She longs for her husband to arrive.
I have to find the antidote.
He is afraid of his grandfather.
Why don't you understand?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I steered clear of sensitive topics.
It suddenly started raining.
Let us know whether you can come.
Could you please take me back home?
I had a nightmare last night.
The party ended at nine.
That jacket is way too big for you.
A lot of people are dealing with allergies now.
You were incompetent.
No matter what happens, just keep smiling.
You're old enough to know better.
I think you owe me an explanation.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
Whether he agrees or not, we won't change our plans.
Let me go!
Please warm yourselves by the fire.
Our school is 80 years old.
I didn't see you come in.
You're disloyal.
They danced until six in the morning.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I feel unwell.
Stop screaming.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Don't you think that's significant?
My father graduated from Harvard University.

The exact same thing happened to me.
This is kind of boring.

I think that it's completely understandable if she turns down his offer.
Do you really think this is worth thirty dollars?

Be polite to your parents.
She picked up beautiful stones.
Let's be careful.
I figured you would understand.
How often do you play hockey?
He showed off his new car.
What if they don't like me?
I'd like to have a little talk with you.
By the way, have you heard from her since then?
I'm afraid it's going to rain tomorrow.
Yours was better.
Fruits have seeds in them.

What do you want?

What are you going to do this evening?

I had nothing to hide.
I was at home then.
I hate myself sometimes.
We're armed.
I know they're still alive.
Soldiers are used to danger.
The statue's head is missing.
You said that you hated Tom.
I'm not afraid to be criticized.
Please tell the others everything you've just told me.
Why did you go over my head on this?
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
A new building is being built in front of my house.
Oh! That's too bad.
I thought I'd never hear that.
I thought you were my friend.
I was afraid I wouldn't have the pleasure of meeting you.
Let Tom stay home.
They arrived at the hotel.
I don't believe Tom would do something like that.
I want to personally thank you.
Nobody had an answer.
Do you really think that Tom is single?
You're the one who trained me.
I wish I had known about this when I was a kid.
I didn't pretend to be your friend.
The roof leaks.
It is kind of pretty.
I can't forgive her.
She is from France.
Where are you headed?
They all speak French.
Enjoy yourselves.
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can.
I've been wrong.
I love trying new things.
You won't believe this.
I don't know how else to say it.
Whatever happens, he won't change his mind.
Don't you recognize that man?
If he'd been there, he'd have told you to mind your manners.
Why did you come here?
The intersection where the accident happened is near here.
Where would you like to go next?
Let's stop this argument.
It's no trouble at all.
I assumed that you would come.
I'd rather not comment on that.
I don't go hunting as often as I used to.
Did you find out what time the meeting starts?
Tom and I will help you.
You scare me.
Tom was horrified when he noticed that his daughter had had her tongue pierced.
We don't need you anymore.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
Let's share this money between the two of us.
I'll give you a call tomorrow night.
No one's coming to our party tonight.
This sentence seems to be grammatically correct.
This book is selling like hotcakes.
I went on with my reading.
We want our money back.
I know the name of this animal.
I'd like to show Tom what I bought today.
Do you realize that?
I got you a present.
The war was finally brought to a close.
I know the perfect place for our party.
He must be severely punished.
What's the exchange rate today?
I didn't know how to react.
Hand over your weapons.
Is that so?
Do you have a fever?
Give him a hug.
Tom promised me he'd come.
You said that you hated Tom.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
I'm working too much.
You've changed since I saw you last year.

I wish I didn't have to work.

Look for clues.
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
The light doesn't work.
I hurried in order not to be late for school.
Get out of my chair.
Someday you should give it a try.
I made dinner.
I have something that belongs to you. Why don't you come over and pick it up?
I feel bad about what I said.
These cameras are made in Japan.
This shirt needs to be washed.
I do worry.
You don't belong here.
No one can tell.
Wait for your sister.
They're in trouble.
You're in a strange mood today.
I'm the type who gets nervous in front of people, so I'm bad at speech making.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
Why didn't you run away?
I revised my theory.

I have a lot of friends.
He can't take his eyes off her.

My wife is suffering from pneumonia.
I have something else in mind.

If you want to know, just ask.
Maybe you'd like to come with us.
Mary had some weird food cravings when she was pregnant.
Has the baby woken up?
I was stunned.
Would you mind paying this time?
Let's come back to it later.
Tom usually comes on time.
Don't they drive you mad?
I had a hunch you would do that.
How was class?
The cat is stuck in the tree.
This is why I don't have a boyfriend.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
She called while I was out.
They're looking for you.
Tom seems young.
I couldn't walk.
I'm glad I invited you.
Do you write in French?
I know Tom is gullible.
I'm going to go get some food.
I've already explained that.
Let me know about the result of the exam.
Did you really do that?
The situation appears desperate.
You'll call me, won't you?
That's what I got.
Tom said that he was busy.
You don't need my help.
Are you up for it?
I don't think you should've done that.
This plan is fool-proof.
I hope that you are good.
You won't regret this. I promise.
They're nice guys.
They disappeared.
That's not what I had in mind.
I just want to talk to you.
Your method is better.
We're taking over.
I don't want you to be upset.
I just assumed that you'd be here.
My wallet's gone.
You've got a lot of nerve bringing me here under false pretenses.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.

My father is two years younger than my mother.
I made a lucky guess.
Do you want to eat?
We walked along the road.
Tom was given a warm reception.
You need to come home right now.
Judging from the look of the sky, it is likely to rain.
I thought your parents liked me.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
Have you made a list yet?
Tom didn't respond right away.
Is there an information counter?
He greeted the lady.
Are you happy with your weight?
That's not surprising.
Please pull the rope.
Please telephone him.
They said there was not enough time for a full investigation.
I'd like to visit your country someday.
We have more customers than we can count.
Are you actually serious?
It seems like I'm going to have a hard day.

The enemy attacked us at night.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
Can you tell me where the nearest pay phone is?
I feel terrible about that.
Do you want to come in?
Tom isn't in bed.
He's likely to be chosen.
Had you been drinking?
You can't choose your parents.
Are we ready to go?
Are you going to eat those eggs?
He told me he would go to Venice.
I have no proof of that.
The doctor told me to inhale and exhale slowly and deeply.
He told me his life's story.
Why won't you look at me?
We don't know that yet.
We were supposed to help Tom yesterday afternoon.
My house faces to the south.
Let us do the work.
I need to open this door.
I do not love him anymore.
The man was hiding in a dense forest.
I figured it would be easy to do.
It's just a fantasy.
You look busy.
I'm more than happy.
Tom just doesn't know what to do.
You run very fast.
I've always liked you.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
If we're going to do this, let's do it right.
What's Tom's address?
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind yet.
We played baseball yesterday.
Tom was very proud.
I want to stay.
Onions can be eaten raw or cooked.
Are you the one who saved me?

I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
There are three main sections.
Do you think students are given enough time to eat lunch?
I know Tom really does care about you.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
Tom waited for Mary for a long time.
You're the best dad ever.
We'd be happy if you could come with us.
Either is acceptable.
He was surprised at the news.
We always have a choice.
Tom says he doesn't know where Mary bought her pearl necklace.
I hope you're well paid.
We'll be there tomorrow afternoon.
He crushed the sheet of paper up into a ball.
This doesn't happen very often.
How have you been recently?
We're not desperate yet.
I was frightened.
You should have helped him with his work.
Tom left everything to Mary in his will.
You are deceiving yourself.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
Please have a drink.
I know you're in love with me.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
Tom got into trouble because of Mary.
She herself gave him something to eat.
I guess you know I've missed you.
We've walked all around the lake.
What can I do for them?
I never want to get married.
This looks good.
If I start eating potato chips, I can't stop.
Don't ask me about the speech.
Did you go to Tom's funeral?
What have you done to him?
You said you had a theory.
This coat is warm.
I can't convey my feelings in words.
I'm not sure of anything.
I thought about that.
Tom is there already.
You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.
If you came, that would be great.
I wanted your cooperation.
I have read the book before.
I thought it was the least I could do.
Tom doesn't eat beef.
I wonder if I should talk to her about the problem.
His opinion is worthless.
Could you call me later?
I can't wait another week.
It's impossible that he forgot our meeting.
I was saved as if by a miracle.
He is an aggressive person.
What's your theory on what happened?
It doesn't matter to me whether or not I make money doing this.
It'd be better to avoid her now, because she's violent.
Tom told me he was full.
Can you tell the difference?
What are you drinking?
Tom was afraid of failure.
I don't like either tea or coffee.
He will always be there.
You're doing all you can.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
He fell in love with a younger woman.
I was born on a ship.
Where did you get that piece of wire?
I ran outside.
I think he ate about 10 oysters.
Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
We missed the deadline.
We should do better.
I left my glasses at home.
I still have the umbrella you lent me.
We should go home.
I did a little research.
Tom can't do even simple arithmetic.
If he really doesn't want to go, he shouldn't have to.
Even I can't believe that.
It's getting there.
I really want you to quit.
I need the key to decode this message.
If I could afford it, I would buy an electric car.
There seem to be lots and lots of stars.
It was a joke.
Those flowers are beautiful.
How many instruments do you know how to play?
I don't know how you can believe such nonsense.
It is very hard to date this vase.
I'll wait until you finish the work.
I'd like to see the car before I rent it.
My advice is to leave as soon as you can.
Everyone is outraged.
He's in pain.
There'll be a lot of expenses.
We could see the ship in the distance.
It was just an accident that we met at the store.
You can't go against the laws of nature.
I want to take another look around.
He jumped into the water.
He's a carbon copy of his father.
The mere sight of a mosquito makes her sick.
Would you give me a break?
How's it going to happen?
I'm a little out of practice.
She ignored him almost all day.
They're stalling.
He lived there by himself.
There is a marked difference between them.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
We have other important issues to discuss.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I couldn't help but laugh.
Tom wants to talk.
Do you like movies?
You need to lose some weight.
I wasn't really certain of that.
Save it on the external hard drive.
If it were not for exams, we would be happy.
Tom said he wouldn't kiss Mary.
Nothing is left to chance.
My son wants to be a professional golfer.
All you have to do is to join us.
Tom couldn't bear the truth.
I'll show you how to do it.
You'll feel better after a bath.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
The bird flapped its wings.
I'll come with you.
I want to test my limits.
It's yours if you want it.
Wait for Tom.
I'll get rid of them.
I appreciate the gesture.
It was fairly funny.
I have an old car.
Your bag is on my desk.
Their contract is to run out at the end of this month.
Tom didn't calm down until much later.
Beware of dog.
I'd be unhappy if that happened again.
Did you see the transcript?
They can't do that.
I appreciate your telling me.
I forget who said it.
The curtain caught on fire.
You don't want to be an editor?
You were mine.
Is Tom OK?
You are not supposed to smoke here.
The deer ran for its life.
Don't make the same mistake again.
Strictly speaking, the tomato is a fruit.
Does that mean you'll have to stay?
Don't ask such hard questions.
I wonder if he likes me.
She listens to him even though no one else does.
You have to disappear.
There is a card on the desk.
You don't seem convinced.
Do you have to stay?
They're so funny.
Next time, I'll drive.
I can't tell my family.
We know it was you that broke the window.
Suddenly it began to rain.
Cookie is a good name for a dog.
I feel relieved.
Tom will find you.
I didn't tell anyone about it.
You'd better make sure that it is true.
I wish I had known about this when I was a kid.
Canada is a large country.
I don't want to go alone.
Tom didn't want Mary to drive drunk.
They all entered.
He said nothing, which made her angry.
You just don't get it, do you?
It is too good to be true.
The city was bombed by enemy planes.
Organic food is healthier.
If he had been a little more careful, the accident would have been avoided.
I'm okay.
Just trust me.
It is good to see you.
I was in way over my head.
Can you lend me a little money?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I have faith in your ability to do the right thing.
You don't know everything.
Who's going to believe you?
The clock has just struck three.
He could not walk any further.
I was mentally and physically tired.
I'm realistic.
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
I seem to have a temperature.
She woke him up.
Do you think that any really smart person is inherently interested in languages?
What did Tom tell you he wanted to drink?
Did Tom tell you the good news?
I want to watch this.
How come I've never seen you here before?
It may have been Tom that wrote this note.
I was taken by surprise.
They grew closer.
Would you like to have a cup of tea?
I couldn't understand his joke.
I could have won the race if I hadn't sprained my ankle.
Everything is bad.
I don't know when he got back from France.
Please sit down for a moment.
You're never going to believe this.
I want to be an actor.
You guys looked mad.
Don't ask me that again.
That's so ironic.
You have to memorize this sentence.
I met them.
Don't press the wrong button.
You don't know what this means to us.
He got up suddenly and walked out of the room.
Your parents must be so proud of you.
Isn't it infuriating?
I think we should talk about this later.
This is an old Scottish song.
Come soon or there won't be any food left.
We want to see you again.
I had bought it the week before.
Your room is big.
I don't want your job.
He called in to say he could not attend the meeting.
I'm here to do what I can.
I don't like it when you're so busy.
We were really excited.
Don't let that bother you.
See you in class.
Does anyone disagree?
I just want to find a cab.
He attributed his success to good luck.
I trusted you.
What have you done with your car?
She felt as if she had seen a ghost.
That's exactly my point.
My father would often go fishing.
I thought you didn't like them.
I can show you a better time.
Flip a coin.
I love the way you kiss.
This isn't worth getting worked up over.
What's the big emergency?
Close the door after you.
You're productive.
I want to know what's so funny.
Give Tom everything you have.
I thought you were broke.
A gentleman is always kind to others.
You can't do it by yourself.
His prediction might come true.
That's all that matters.
That's not how it happened.
Your answer to the question turned out to be wrong.
Sit down, Tom.
She allegedly murdered him.
If you don't want to stay alone, I can keep you company.
I don't think we've been introduced.
I didn't win, but at least I got a consolation prize.
Let's take a short cut.
I helped fix the leak.
In case of an earthquake, turn off the gas.
Tom likes to do things his own way.
Don't forget to answer the letter.
I shouldn't have stayed up all night.
I already told you he isn't here.
Let's go out and have a good time with our friends.
It was blowing hard all night.
You're so beautiful in that dress.
Tom is trying to get it right.
Does anyone know you're here?
I think you misunderstood what I said.
I was fired in 2013.
What's your favorite breakfast food?
Have you ever given money to a beggar?
He became furious.
I didn't know that you were waiting.
Everyone likes her.
Move over.
Did you vote in the last election?
What is it you want to talk about?
I need time.
French developed from Latin.
He painted the ceiling blue.
You can't handle this alone.
Tell me more about yourself.
Would you like me to go there with you?
Are you still playing the bassoon?
They accepted each other.
She's only two years old, but she can already count to 100.
How's your Christmas shopping coming along?
She went upstairs.
I wonder if you are truly happy.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
They won't tell you the truth.
Tom walked towards the stairs.
I'm not asking your permission.
I'm not at all busy.
It happened that we were on the same bus.
Who's paying for the food?
If you don't want to sing, you don't have to.
You did say that.
Is anything happening?
Shut all the doors and windows.
How long will it take?
You can save your breath. There is no use talking to him.
My father is at home.
He'll arrive within an hour.
I'm not getting involved.
Can we roller-skate in this park?
I'm impressed with your French.
If I had the money, I would immediately buy this computer.
I feel a lot safer now.
What's your greatest fear?
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
Tom is a really good person.
This is delicious. What is it?
They arrived just in time for the last train.
Please take a look at that picture.
I figured that you'd be impressed.
I was relaxed.
Everyone is afraid of Tom.
Do you have a chain saw I could borrow?
Don't lose heart.
Am I clear?
He did it himself.
Tom said he saw something suspicious the morning Mary died.
Please close the door quietly.
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
You're very sharp.
The summit nations put free trade at the top of the agenda.
I was hoping that you'd know the answer.
I only hope it is not too late.
She has gone shopping.
My feet are sore.
Is there a particular way I'm supposed to address you?
I saw a stranger enter that house.
I hate to put you through this.
Tom has something that I want.
A friend is hard to find and easy to lose.
Do you play any sports?
That's incredibly boring.
This is an apple.
That's just awesome.
Who are those men in white suits?
Tom is the fattest man I know.
Do you have a choice?
Tom knew Mary wouldn't want to go.
Beautiful stained glass is art.
Tom is yelling at Mary.
Was that not clear?
We've got to talk seriously.
I want to go out with you.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
I couldn't finish it.
It wasn't Tom that Mary was angry with.
I'm just looking, thank you.
Eventually, Tom will likely agree to help us.
There were survivors.
If only I could speak English!
I drank a glass of red wine after dinner.
He turned on the radio.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
Our rent is four times as much as it was ten years ago.
Today is a good day to die.
A strange incident happened during his speech.
I'm glad I have a friend like you to confide in.
Tom came here to study French.
He arrived in time for the meeting.
If you behave like a flunkey, you're treated like a flunkey.
Can you show me how to do this?
He consented on the spot.
Why are you so angry with me?
I'm very grateful for what you've done.
There is an urgent need for them to update their system.
He lives alone in the woods.
Where did that come from?
Tom is hoping we'll do that.
You must be more polite.
You were watching, weren't you?
She may be a nurse. I am not sure.
Don't be fresh with me.
Tom is a very creative person.
It doesn't look that way.
We'll do the same for you.
Hold the elevator, Tom.
Maybe I should take this.
How do I get a hold of you?
He promised not to say it.
That's a sign.
Tom is old enough to be Mary's grandfather.
I took for granted that he got homesick.
I'm on my lunch break.
I'll fix your sink for you if you want.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
I never did that.
Does anybody hear me?
I had a little fever this morning.
I saw what you did.
Tom didn't want to be late.
You need to tell me what to do.
They agreed to work together.
I used to play tennis when I was a student.
I hurried to the station only to find that the train had already left.
I think it's time for me to buy a new camera.
I used to be very fat.
Stay in bed.
Come back here.
Let's just forget it ever happened.
They were dead.
I don't like big dogs.
Do you understand the concept?
Don't make me do it again.
Do you speak French fluently?
I don't believe we've met.
Let's start.
I never did it again.
Am I under suspicion?
I must remind you of your promise.
He keeps this gun loaded.
He is not too old to do it.
Are you that stupid?
Tom ate more than I did.
Drink more water.
It was shorter than she expected.
You have to take off your shoes before you can come in.
What are you mumbling?
It is an endangered species.
Do you want to ask me a question?
Many flights were canceled because of the typhoon.
Turn toward me, please.
I had back surgery a couple of months ago.
Some of his officers protested.
Pay very close attention.
I don't think that Tom lied to us.
I can't do it.
I'm falling in love with you.
I thought you'd be alone.
You have my mug.
Tom asked Mary to come back tomorrow.
As soon as the new teacher entered the classroom, the students began to applaud.
This should be plenty.
I have an urgent message from Tom.
We all consider your idea to be impractical.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
That's all I said.
I'm tired of Boston.
Opinions are not facts.
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
I can recommend it to anyone.
She speaks Chinese.
I'm getting more and more gray hair.
I appreciate all you've done.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
He surrendered.
I hope all but one of your dreams come true, so you always have something to strive for.
I thought you'd want to try some Japanese food.
I'm the one who's going to die.
I was going to suggest the following possibility.
Our request was approved.
I'm strong enough.
Your brother wasn't at school today.

It is too difficult a problem for me to solve.
You're very kind, Tom.
I did warn you.
I've taken care of everything.
America is a land of immigrants.
He broke down when he heard the bad news.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
What lovely weather!
How can you be sure that's true?
Would you lend me your pen?
Tom won't believe it.
They can't see me.
We have been waiting here for hours.
Please turn up the air conditioner.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
Tom says he didn't do it.
He used to love that.

I eat a lot of meat.
We're all busy.
Is that what you want to do?
They don't understand French.
There's food on the table.
He has been very busy this week.
It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
I think you look hot.

That's what everyone does.
You shouldn't get married.
It rained a lot that winter.
He chased the thief.
You're all alone.
He was hard to please.
She took me by the hand.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
Don't be so dramatic.
Why did you stop?
He got down on his knees and prayed for the souls of the deceased.
I think that's a stupid idea.
Why are you always whining?
Tom is claustrophobic.

How do you put up with it?
Choose the color you like the best.
Blue lines on the map designate rivers.

I hope you'll come.
How much do you spend on food every month?
I'm impressed you've done so well.
Don't cut in while we're talking.
I'm not the only one who got here early.
I figured that you'd enjoy this movie.
I cannot afford a holiday.
We just don't know why.
You'll be the first to know.
It always happens the same way.
You should keep your promise.
I'm the youngest one here.
I'm sure Tom had a good reason.
Give the dog some water.
You won't be needing that.

You're too loud.
Tom doesn't even like driving.
I know Tom is a good actor.
What's all that racket?
Can I ask why not?

Were you expecting something different?
I think it's time for me to give her a ride home.

We both fell asleep.
Everyone called me Tom.
Some people seem to agree with you.
The man robbed her bag.

Take a breath.
I enjoy being with you.
How long do we have to stay here?
I'm delighted to meet you.
I can't believe the way everyone is reacting.
How many people are in your crew?
Who were you talking with?
This is hogwash.
Do you want to drink?
Haven't you finished your meal yet?
I just can't help you this time.
Be content.
Let's decide together where to go first.
Stay away from us.
I have to tell you that I don't love you anymore.
I can't use it.
Please keep in touch.
Who am I supposed to go with?

Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
I know Tom has been forgiven.
This doesn't surprise me.
May the new year bring you happiness!
What results do you anticipate?
Imagine that you have a time machine.
I figured that you'd be impressed.
Would you mind if we put this off until tomorrow?
Why don't you talk to us now?
Could I get my ring back?
I hope you're not offended.
No one else knows it.
I don't know how you can tolerate doing this over and over again.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I'll call you a cab.
I want you to explain it to me in more detail.
Tom won't go to prison.
She called for help.
Tom can't come over today.
I do it all the time.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
We thought it was hilarious.
That should please everyone.
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
I learned French in school.
Where did it come from?
I wish Tom would stop that.
He selected a pair of socks to match his suit.
As for me, I like this better.
No one could see us.
I admit it.
My family is very proud of me.
My heart aches for those starving children.
What is it you want most?
I love to party.
He compared the copy with the original.
You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
I thought you were older than me.
Tom is nervous, isn't he?
Stop smoking.
The class was too big so we split up into two smaller groups.
They grew closer.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
The same holds true for Germany.
Tom is not a very friendly guy.
He's looking at you.
Did you have fun?
Stop shouting.
Are you hurt?
Is it worth it or not?
Nobody noticed her absence.
What else have you got going on?
This is very good.
How long did you have to wait for the bus?
The colonists bartered with the natives for fur.
We're in sync.
Be sure to turn off the light when you leave the room.
Have they spotted you?
Tom is the most influential man in Boston.
I baked it for you.
Would you drop it?
You don't seem so smart.
It's unlikely that our team will win.
She got married at the age of seventeen.
To tell the truth, I don't like what you're wearing.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
He convinced me of his innocence.
I didn't want to do this in the first place.
They changed it very recently.
What is the name of that bird?
He responded to her offer with a laugh.
It could be deadly.
I crossed the street.
I am not getting involved.
Is there any coffee in the kitchen?
Who's Tom?
He is one of my neighbours.
Can I write it that way?
Let go of it.
This is a kind of bread.
I was astonished.
Instead of going to Europe, I decided to go to America.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
The children watched TV as Tom was cooking dinner.
I was a student at that time.
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
Good night, everyone!
How many flowers did you buy?
She went over the list to see if her name was there.
Get out of here now!
It's so obvious.
I thought you'd ask that.
We go to the movies together once in a while.
How old is your daughter?
That's not how it works.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
What's in the bottle?
I couldn't see a thing.
You're really incredible.
If you had been a little more patient, you could have succeeded.
How're you holding up?
That makes everything simpler.
We're getting closer.
They look similar in some ways.
He succeeded in business.
Thanks very much.
Tom is schizophrenic.
I don't know what I'm doing yet.
Got it?
We finally arrived at the lake.
Is she your only daughter?
I think you're going to want to sit down.
Here it is.
Don't forget to mail this letter.
There is only one bath towel.
If only she were to help, the job would be finished sooner.
Could you take some pictures of us?
She went mad after the death of her son.
Tom's a nice guy. Everyone likes him.
What are they made of?
The bear was eating an apple.
She was present at the party.
Can you teach me how to do that?
What he said might be true.
My son is taller than me.
I had good reasons to do that.
There are some good apples in the basket.
There was a long silence.
There is no way of knowing where he's gone.
Turn it off.
I never felt this way before I met you.
Don't release that dog.
He managed to pass the examination.
Why is it important to recycle?
I believe in myself.
That wouldn't be a good thing.
It's easy if you try.
I was talking about you.
Please don't tell anyone.
My brother is very important. At least he thinks he is.
It's about time.
I've seen a couple of Kurosawa's films.
What kind of wine do you have?
They were very demanding.
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.
Do you speak Chinese?
My idea is quite different from yours.
Tom said that Mary was ambidextrous.
Would it be OK if I drank a little more tea?
I'm psyched.
That doesn't interest me anymore.
This car has a good warranty.
I don't often tell jokes.
They don't care.
That was very interesting.
I love music.
I can't understand what you said at all.
I want you to sing.
Tom hates me.
I used to be fat.
I told him everything.
I could not get anybody to go with me, and so I went by myself.
Get down.
He climbs trees easily.
Don't you just love a mystery?
They make good use of their rooms.
What did you say?
The police are looking for you.
Do you like roller coasters?
I lent him a magazine.
The present time is a good time.
Perhaps I shouldn't have done that.
Banks charge higher interest on loans to risky customers.
I waited for him till ten.
Keep that.
You shouldn't eat that.
Can you please look the other way?
I suggest you do your job and let me do mine.
Tom isn't a very good farmer.
Can you tell me what it means?
Tell us all the gossip.
Do you have time?
I should not have said that.
My friend says that she's suicidal.
We'll help you.
I won't say it again.
You never told me you had a brother.
We're in college.
You disgust me.
Criminals should be punished.
Tom spoke in French at the meeting.
That's my opinion.
Japan's consumption of rice is decreasing.
I was more than a little shocked by this.
I'm friends with a lot of them.
Which doctor is attending you?
How many kinds are there?
I can't survive without air conditioning in the summer.
Do you all feel that way?
He asked me to return the money to him immediately.
I had the boy carry my bag.
This mango is sweet.
I wish them luck.
Whose is it?
Tom still uses a typewriter.
It took me several hours to draw it.
We have a serious problem on our hands.
Tom pleaded guilty in October.
She grabbed him by the hand.
Tom never falls.
Tom didn't know what Mary wanted to buy.
He is old.
I filled the bucket with water.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
You're very brave.
Tom doesn't know French.
Take off your wet clothes.
I did everything I could think of.
That's Tom's house.
Why aren't you wearing gloves?
The floor must be very clean.
Don't you worry about a thing.
She needs to help him.
He can do five somersaults without breaking a sweat.
Salmon can jump up to 12 feet high.
I just wanted to help Tom.
I think we can work something out.
A nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.
You lost.
It was worth a try.
She has a bicycle.
She grew roses.
I chopped a tree down.
You're very good.
You aren't in a hurry, are you?
Have you betrayed me?
She majors in organic chemistry.
Night watchmen drink a lot of coffee.
How come the sky is blue?
Was it you that left the door open last night?
She is really into knitting.
Every morning she gets up early because she has to cook.
Tom and Mary both started to laugh.
Don't worry. We'll find it.
That isn't exactly what I said.
I caught him by the arm.
She can't find her hat.
Toss your gun on the ground.
Oh come on, don't be scared.
Are you afraid of the dark?
He has a perfect command of English.
She lived a lonely life.
You're carrying this too far.
Tom said he had to help Mary.
I have a bad headache today.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
I screwed up the very first note.
Can you do bookkeeping?
We can't get out of this.
This is serious, Tom.
Let's start the party.
They will not pass!
How do you know they're looking for us?
They're not coming back.
You can invite other people.
Tom asked the stranger who he was.
I recognised him immediately.
I don't think he has anything to do with the matter.
I don't care what happened.
People want to own land.
Do we need to bring our dictionaries to class tomorrow?
Did you read the instructions?
What does this word mean?
Tom didn't know Mary was so funny.
Tom accidentally shot himself in the foot.
I dove into the river.
We thanked Tom for taking our picture.
Machines may one day think, but they'll never laugh.
I want to check something.
Are you productive?
I don't see Tom as often as I'd like.
May I borrow your phone?
Shopping malls are popular among teenagers.
Come quickly. It's urgent.
He speaks English with a strong German accent.
I can handle this, no problem.
Look closely.
I have a few easy questions for you.
We could've made a fortune.
She mixed him up with someone else.
How can I get rid of him?
Are they all nuts?
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
I'd like to try this on. Where are the fitting rooms?
I'm illiterate.
I know Tom is undependable.
Don't worry. It's easy.
We're finally alone.
Everyone is going to call me a liar.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
They all objected to his proposal.
Tom didn't get off the airplane with the rest of the passengers.
He is popular with everybody.
Did you hear the roar of the lions?
I broke my fingernail.
All the money was spent on clothes.
The small boy slowly made some new friends.
I think I can answer that.
If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me.
I got slapped on both cheeks.
The baby's sleeping.
The addict died from a drug overdose.
People are dying.
I consider him a great scientist.
I have to speak with you immediately.
Some students looked at her with tears in their eyes.
Can I leave a message?
I can't go any further.
I worked this morning.
I know Tom isn't a Canadian.
I don't want to sing.
Flies and mosquitoes interfered with his meditation.
He got out from under the car.
Tom and Mary cut classes and went to the zoo.
Tom pretends he doesn't understand French.
This may change next year.
It's easy to remember.
You'd better try something else.
You never told me about this before.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
In case I can't come, I'll give you a call beforehand.
Students have access to the library.
This bird can't fly.
It's difficult for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
It is a pity that you can't join us.
They walked together.
The two sisters lived very peacefully.
How many did you want?
Japan depends on foreign trade.
Your life depends on it.
He often quotes Milton.
He took off his hat.
I just had to see this for myself.
That child was left in the sun too long.
You're no different.
Tom couldn't help showing off.
He is on the team.
Does that window open?
Don't let Tom hit you.
Tell me where you've been.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
I can be impartial.
Please let me know if it hurts.
I need a little time.
I gave you fair warning.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
Do you need an ambulance?
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
He is more lucky than clever.
It seems that they took the wrong train.
I promised I'd tell you the truth.
I think you need to spend a little more time on your homework.
Keep your eyes on the road.
What would you do without me?
I got fined.
That was last week.
You chose a good one.
I'm not that crazy.
Catching cancer early increases survival odds.
Who's this guy?
We've been up all night.
I'll babysit your kids for you.
I've been doing this longer than you.
I want you to understand this isn't going to be easy.
Tom didn't want to listen to reason.
We're meditating.
He knows many people.
Here's the change.
That's very odd.
I assure you this isn't just about money.
Everyone fell asleep.
Tom wondered why his wife left him.
I hope you like chocolate cake.
He's not breaking the law.
Are you aware you're being named in a lawsuit against the federal government?
Give us a ride downtown.
We are about to sit down to dinner.
This museum has been closed for five years.
Bad news travels quickly.
Having a few extra batteries handy is never a bad idea.
We have a deal.
Of all my friends, he is the closest.
I know Tom is tough.
You need to be more patient.
Let me help you with those groceries.
My car is right there.
I really don't recommend that today.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I want something to write on.
I bet that he'll accept your proposal.
She rides her bike to school.
You'd better not stay up too late.
Tom has a sister in Boston.
The middle one is mine.
I forgot to tell you the babysitter's name.
We don't trust the government.
What is wrong with you people?
He wants to work in a hospital.
I'm really unhappy about this.
I prefer soap as a liquid rather than a bar.
Do you accept the explanation?
I have a friend whose father is a lawyer.
You don't need to go unless you want to.
I had a great time tonight.
The radio doesn't work.
I was very young when that happened.
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen.
We found something.
Why did you join the Army?
Who did you talk with?
Can we drop this?
Won't you have some more tea?
I went to bed very late.
They'll think of something.
They just wanted to ask me a few questions.
Don't walk on the grass.
What do you think of this tie?
You can say whatever you want to.
The idea isn't bad.
I've finally got the whole set!
I owe you a breakfast.
I don't have the address with me.
He is able to swim very fast.
He did it again.
It's raining hard.
Hand it over.
You had better not keep company with him.
This photo was taken by Tom.
I was forced to drink against my will.
The door remained closed all day.
Mary is on maternity leave.
Tom is having a heart attack.
Cover it up.
Hold the vase with both hands.
The ice is too hard to crack.
Tom brought his dog with him.
Did Tom say why he was fired?
You said you'd do anything for me.
Are you as tall as me?
Both Tom and Mary are teachers.
I love games.
She can swim as fast as her brother.
That's a real long shot.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Tom took another sip.
When my dad finds out, he won't be happy.
Be prepared.
Tom looks disgusted.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I don't care what you think.
I know you recently retired.
I want to know what you're doing here.
You don't have to wait until the end.
I know Tom is groggy.
Aren't you hungry?
She knows her limitations.
This is different.
He wanted to succeed.
He saw it, too.
My mother is on a diet.
You can't take it with you.
She advised him to stay in bed for two more days.
I want you to know that I can't be there tomorrow.
I fell asleep in class.
I just have one question for you.
I want you to sing.
How dare you to talk in that tone with me!
What's the weight of your suitcase?
What do you intend to do with the money?
He doesn't have the ticket.
I'm the same height as he is.
He spoke with a typical Texan drawl.
Six percent home loans represent the industry average now.
What would you like for dessert?
One lives in Fukuoka, and the others live in Niigata.
You don't have the ticket.
Are you sure he can do this?
I was wondering if we could talk.
Tom wanted to go to Boston.
She dumped him for a younger man.
What should I be doing?
I'd rather stay anonymous.
Tom has lost another umbrella.
I almost never work on Saturdays.
She hired him as an interpreter.
He told me to be here at noon.
We're doing everything we can for Tom.
I cut down a cherry tree.
It looks very nice.
Do you know the difference?
I'm not here.
As is often the case with young men, he does not pay much attention to his health.
No one is at fault.
Do you need a ride home later?
I'm going to miss you.
He got the job.
I would like to get to know you better.
Expedited delivery will cost an additional ten dollars.
At first, I mistook him for your brother.
I didn't say it made sense.
You and I made a bargain.
Is there a pen on the desk?
Follow your desire.
He walks fast.
Be there tonight.
I know Tom was early.
How is the weather there?
It's too thin.
A person who won't read has no advantage over one who can't read.
Do you have to work today?
So what do you suggest?
I just want you to know how much I appreciate this.
What do you need a doctor for?
She's wearing a hat.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
I need some soap.
Will you sell your house to him?
Her son was killed in a traffic accident.
I want you to take care of Tom for a little while.
I felt wonderful.
I loved watching you dance.
Is her house anywhere near the station?
Where were you all night?
I like folk songs.
Keep a box of baking soda in the fridge to keep it smelling clean.
We won't have enough time to do that before Tom gets here.
Unfortunately, I already have plans for that day.
He doesn't want to live in the city.
Give me one minute.
That's a horse of a different color.
At home, we speak only French.
If you feed your dog properly, you can increase his lifespan.
Tom is John and Mary's third child.
Don't say too much.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I remember telling her that news.
Tom cut the wire and defused the bomb.
Tom took a selfie and sent it to Mary.
I'm done.
There are many fish in this lake.
I knew someone would come rescue us eventually.
Quit wasting my time.
I'm going to miss this place.
I fell in love with her.
Tom isn't rude.
He kept me waiting for an hour.
There's something strange going on.
I know where Tom hides the key.
She is working on the problem.
I felt lonely.
You must reboot your computer.
I don't usually sweat like this.
Don't lean against this wall.
No one is invulnerable.
She is weak by nature.
His older sister is older than my oldest brother.
Don't touch the glass.
It's okay as long as no one finds out about it.
I have a request to make.
How's your old lady doing?
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
He is too dumb to fear danger.
Do you want to ask me some questions?
Please tell me what you know about it.
I left one of my books at school.
I should think she is under thirty.
It was a secret.
I had a problem to take care of.
Do I need to transfer?
I admit he's smart, but does he have to talk over everyone's heads all the time?
Tom doesn't have a cat. However, Tom does have a dog, doesn't he?
It's your decision.
Tom had only one leg.
I keep a daily record of the temperature.
Tom is getting better quickly.
The bus turned around the corner.
Are you free after school?
Ask her her name.
Happy is the man who is content with his lot.
Tom is always watching TV.
I had to hide.
We're trying.
I always wear a helmet when I ride my bicycle.
I'm sure Tom will know how to do it.
Do you understand what I am saying?
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I can't figure this out.
They had good chemistry.
Are you in Boston?
I think it's time for us to come to an agreement.
I don't like you at all.
This was a mistake.
You look very dignified.
The trouble is that my son does not want to go to school.
Take a closer look.
I don't understand him sometimes.
He was unconscious of his guilt.
How do you handle stress?
I dream in French.
Everyone's standing.
To learn a foreign language requires a lot of time.
I knew it was a lie.
She lied about her age.
We nearly starved.
You may go where you please.
She learned to ride a bicycle last year.
They adore Tom.
I suppose you've already applied for a visa.
Her argument was not based on facts.
Who caused the accident?
Who crashed the party?
Did you eat all the bread?
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
Do they have their suitcases?
Be more flexible.
Do you care to hazard a guess?
I know it by heart.
That's not an issue.
Tom has constructive ideas.
To loosen a screw, turn it to the left.
I don't have to do that if I don't want to, do I?
I am accustomed to living alone.
Can you show me where I am on this map?
Do you think you could stop doing that?
Please call him.
Let me give you a little tip.
Why don't you stick around for a few minutes?
I'll take the yellow one.
I'm here as a tourist.
Can't you enhance the image?
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
I'm really not hungry.
Make up your own mind.
They wanted something better.
Aren't you contradicting yourself?
The police fished a dead body out of the river this morning.
Tom is always complaining about his wife.
I'm not going to tell you how to do that.
Wait. I want to tell you something.
We've been here for a couple hours.
You don't know my brother.
As soon as he comes back, let me know.
He disappeared in the crowd.
I now know what I told you was wrong.
Don't forget to pick me up at 6 o'clock tomorrow.
I've done this before.
What do you think about all this?
My papers were in that box.
He told me an interesting story.
I don't agree with him at all.
I'm not good at classifying things.
I am hungry because I did not eat breakfast.
I'm one of your employees.
Few people were killed in the car accident.
Can we do it on Monday instead?
Stop deluding yourself.
Further investigation is required.
Tom called to say he'd be late.
Tom clearly lied.
I really am glad you're here.
Out of the two, I choose the less expensive one.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Get out of my sight.
I just want to go home.
Since I had a cold, I didn't go visit him.
May I have a napkin?
He asked her questions.
Are you happy?
When did it begin to rain?
I would like to rent a car.
There's no minimum wage here.
What's your favorite board game?
I can speak Chinese.
I don't have a badge.
Clean your room.
You're not normal.
He looks suspicious.
My friends stood by me during the court case.
He is a nice man, except that he talks too much.
I know Tom knew I did that.
He studied the flight of birds.
The children are safe.
Can you count to ten in Chinese?
The king is coming.
We resumed negotiations with that company.
Tom's shoes are too small for him.
Women today drink as much as men.
The food was finger-licking good.
I've got a pretty vivid imagination.
I didn't drive.
You're taller than I am.
Give me a bit more time, please.
I didn't tell him you were coming.
I've got something in the oven.
Didn't anyone tell you?
I don't like to sing in French.
We can't see anything.
I had to look after you.
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
I'd like to ask you some questions about some of the people you have working for you.
I'm very sorry I came home so late.
Please excuse my bad handwriting.
Who wears the pants in your family?
He looked through a magazine.
I don't remember where I put my key.
You ought not to miss it.
Everything is OK.
I am joking.
My mother has been dead these ten years.
Don't forget to put on some sunscreen.
That's why Tom won.
He played tennis all day long.
He sang some old songs.
I think we'll make it if we hurry.
We buy CDs.
What do you plan to major in in college?
Besides being a surgeon, he was a famous writer.
I feel faint.
I'll help you pack.
She had no brother.
Both my father and my brother work in this factory.
It makes no sense whatsoever.
I want to go there once again.
I want to cut down on the time it takes to process records.
No one can match him in English.
This book is written in French.
Tom understands what you don't.
Stop being cruel.
They won't let Tom escape.
Tom is lying ill in bed.
I don't think Tom did that on purpose.
He always leaves the window open while he sleeps.
I'm proud of you guys.
Does it bother you if I smoke?
I don't want to get you in trouble.
We'll have little snow this winter.
Few students understand Latin.
Get a life!
I bought a house.
I don't tell people what to eat.
Don't even talk to me.
They're still together.
I've got some chores to do.
I guess I was mistaken.
I always wonder what happened to him.
I just can't believe they're getting married.
It's a strange one.
I took part in the contest.
Isn't one of you enough?
How soon can you start?
Those are the properties that she owns.
The teacher has three times as many books as I do.
My little brother goes to an elementary school.
He never loses hope.
Park the car in the shade.
We're counting on you to wake us up in time, so don't fall asleep.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Tom expects a lot.
I'm sure they're on their way.
I'm going to call the police.
We swam in the sea.
If only I'd been a little taller!
Do I look happy to you?
Do your homework right away.
You're very beautiful.
We finally reached the top of the mountain.
Why do you despise people?
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
The boys in the village laughed at me.
That's not something I want to do.
She advised him to stop taking that medicine, but he felt he needed to.
I know that you have issues with your mom.
His son was expelled from school.
Can I park my car here?
Don't give up halfway.
Tom went on a business trip last week.
He doesn't know yet.
You may go in now.
Beautiful woman, isn't she?
Tom said he'd like to visit Boston.
Our team won the game.
Take as much as you like.
They're cops.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Do you know how to drive a car?
I forgot his address.
The horse is mine.
Are they all strong?
Get out of here, all of you!
Was there much damage?
The typhoon gathered strength.
I like to be thorough.
Is your trunk locked?
The check, please.
You must do as I say.
I'll pay later.
Tom couldn't find his shoes.
I refuse to open the door.
Are you sure he can do this?
You're very timid.
Do you feel guilty?
He received me cordially.
Our class has forty-five students.
Don't tell me to shut up.
Someone is knocking on the door.
We were ambushed.
Why is this only in French?
I didn't like what I saw on TV.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
I'm now your boss.
Tom, you should see this.
Everyone needs to work together.
Small businesses are often absorbed by a major company.
Tom asked Mary if she had to do that.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
You will survive.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
What other choice did I have?
I just got a tattoo.
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
Do you think that eating with your family is important?
You tried to stop Tom from doing that, didn't you?
Is this your locker?
I'm scheduled to have lunch with him.
I got it for Christmas.
My job will only last two years at most.
Can you believe this is really happening?
I would rather stay at home than go out on such a cold day.
Everybody breaks this law.
A madman is not accountable for his actions.
I must leave now.
I prefer to go barefoot in the house.
I should've known it was a waste of time.
I hate this part of the movie.
I don't have anybody else to turn to.
Should I cancel the call?
Tom decided to cooperate.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
Anyone over eighteen years of age counts as an adult.
What's your theory on what happened?
You shouldn't depend on others too much.
I don't like being cheated.
I am taking French next year.
We have to give them something.
I know everything that you've done.
How are you going to get home?
Tom was very annoyed.
I wish I had had a camera then.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
You have to hold back.
Tom didn't expect Mary to react like she did.
Stop being so nice to me.
She has wet hair.
We had to alter our plans because we didn't have enough money.
He is good at soccer.
You must not touch the paintings.
He tied his dog up to the tree while he went into the store.
We met at two in the afternoon.
I couldn't live like that.
Am I disturbing anything?
I support you whole-heartedly.
I don't care what anyone says.
Don't you read the tabloids?
Tom carried his son on his back.
Do you speak Japanese?
Anything else? "No, that's all."
This window won't open.
Tom doesn't think he'll be able to finish the job by himself.
It's almost time to go to bed.
I haven't seen you for a while.
You can go if you want to.
You had better put on your crash helmet.
What happened?
Cyprus is an island.
Casualties were inevitable.
You look busy.
I'm not sure why they asked me that.
I surprised myself.
This is the village where he was born.
The rule does not apply in our case.
You should not give him up for lost.
I don't feel so good.
Do you want to see my translations?
None of us can see them.
I don't need a lecture.
Tom says he likes Boston better than Chicago.
It'll definitely rain.
That is where you are wrong.
That toy is made of wood.
The sky was bright and clear.
We ate a nice meal and drank wine.
I want a full report before 2:30.
I think we're on the right path.
I have two tickets.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for the rest of his life.
Close the door, please.
I suppose that's why you don't like me so much.
Tom always shouts when he is angry.
It won't take long.
Do you want us to take you with us?
Tom is probably at home now.
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me.
She is well known in both India and China.
Tom had no sooner arrived than he was asked to leave.
Tom is living in Boston.
The cat is in the well.
I'm trying to quit smoking.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
I have to talk with him about the new plan.
She volunteered to help him.
Where are they going to?
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
You can't blame this on us.
Can you do it faster?
Do you want to hear my theory?
Oil is extracted from olives.
What's your favorite poem?
Tom didn't know who Mary had decided to give her old guitar to.
What can you see?
Are you still recovering from last night?
I thought you'd be pleased.
That doesn't sound like something you would say.
Movie making is an exciting job.
I quoted some famous phrases in my book.
I don't know how to spell the word.
Tom helped Mary stand up.
At least try to come on time.
I'd like to find a French-speaking doctor.
You're very talented.
I brought you a little something.
I have a Canadian wife.
Stop flirting with my sister.
I would like to visit France someday.
Everything is good.
I didn't want to spend any more time than necessary cooking for my family.
He has a strong body.
I knew it wouldn't be that easy.
You're really selfish.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
You get used to it.
He writes to his mother every now and then.
He asked me what I had been doing.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
This is so exciting.
The house stood out because of its unusual shape.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I'm not sure I want the job.
I like neither of them.
You look fat.
This can't be what it looks like.
Do I have to spell this out for you?
When must I turn in the report?
We are having trouble with our new neighbor.
They won't make it.
He never cared much for me.
Where are you from?
Is that what you want?
Tom is a good kisser.
The cat was not buried alive. He survived.
Tom unwrapped his sandwich.
We learned why the French Revolution broke out.
That's a question we're all asking ourselves.
My father works in a factory.
Can they give you something for that?
You must work hard to succeed.
The storm kept us from searching for the missing child.
It's going to snow Monday.
How's your married life?
The whole class was quiet.
You're charming.
Many people in these parts have fallen on hard times.
I can't accept your gift.
You're not that old.
A blood vessel burst inside his brain.
Tom has some nosy neighbors.
He got bored quickly.
Nothing is forgiven.
My grandfather was killed in World War II.
Basset hounds are gentle dogs.
I didn't know that would happen.
If I were you, I wouldn't do such a thing.
Don't you feel like going to the movies?
Dark clouds are a sign of rain.
There used to be a large park here.
Why aren't you studying French?
My mother is making dinner.
Take this medicine every six hours.
He wants you to come home.
You should have told it to me sooner.
Have you ever dreamed about me?
You won't be shot.
I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope.
He loves me.
I'm old enough to do that by myself.
I'm sure you will succeed.
A smart dog never barks for no reason.
Tom contributed.
It's a shame.
I always counted you as a friend.
Which key is it?
He likes hunting.
I'm against the death penalty.
I'm all done.
Ask him his name.
Children often hate spinach.
He caught hold of a rope and saved himself.
He was sharpening a knife.
Just stay away from my daughter.
I want to make a good impression.
Close your eyes and tell me what you hear.
She found the key to my heart.
Who's going to believe that?
I can't afford to buy a new one.
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?
This is offensive.
I can't explain it to you now.
I heard you did well.
Tom is an imposter.
You'll like this.
Have you told your parents?
I consider Tom to be my best friend.
What time did you wake up?
We are all in the same situation.
If you want to succeed in life, work hard.
I haven't understood anything.
Did you hear about Tom's promotion?
Let's list all the reasons we need to do this.
We have the opposite problem.
I knew I shouldn't have worn this color.
His ID was fake.
There was another problem.
Why don't you read it for yourself?
My brother is out of work.
Are you up?
Thanks for the advice.
Is that your teacher?
Shut the door, please.
May I see you tomorrow?
Just remember to have fun.
Mary still plays with dolls.
I thought you might come.
You're not the first.
Tom is here, right?
I love both of you.
Are you sure that it was Tom?
We must concentrate on that.
I can't draw a bird.
My kid was in the car.
Don't you tell me to relax.
Do you know what the population of Boston is?
I won't be wearing a tie.
How did you come to know her?
Send him in.
Looking out of the window, I saw a rainbow.
I'll need your help.
That's very mature of you.
They incited him to commit the crime.
He's an Asian-American.
They admired the fine view from the hill.
Don't attack me.
Please take a look at this picture.
I didn't even know that my car had been stolen.
I thought it might be you.
Does he know that you love him?
Tom and Mary are young and healthy.
You're worried, aren't you?
Everything is normal.
You can't erase the past.
He cried and cried.
Everyone is here now.
Please put some candles on the birthday cake.
Can I borrow your car?
We've really got to step on it.
She is a good writer.
I'll see you there.
He didn't reply to my letter.
He doesn't have his medication.
I was told you were an expert.
I often have the same dream.
I played tennis.
When you come next time, bring your brother.
I don't want to force you to go.
Don't forget to turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
The situation changed the following year.
I have to do my best.
Please lower the window.
I'd like to know what's happening here.
I wish there were more people like you.
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's what Tom promised.
They told me about it.
Your question has no answer.
She got him to do everything she wanted him to do.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
Come over here and join us.
Do you think there's a hope?
Bad weather is no obstacle.
We are happy to have you join our team.
The thieves divvied up the stolen loot among themselves.
Never bite the hand that feeds you.
Look at the next page.
There's a park near my house.
He looked back.
Can you complete the job in two days?
He remained steadfast to his principles.
We nearly starved.
You seem to have a crush on Tom.
Do you take me for a fool?
When are you going home?
I'm glad you're OK again.
Your shirt is wrinkled.
Don't use too much water.
Sometimes I don't get you.
Are you going to buy that?
I'm a farmer.
I can feel my pulse quickening already.
I don't plan on telling you anything.
She naturally accepted the invitation.
You're after me.
No one can help you, Tom.
Everybody was crying, even Tom.
Why do you need a knife?
Why is it such a big secret?
I've never been better.
He's an oceanographer.
You're not wearing any pants.
What foods are you allergic to?
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I intend to listen to it tonight.
Can you leave me alone?
We're not interested.
He grew up to be an engineer.
I like this book.
He went back to the store.
I should have done this years ago.
It sounds good to me.
Things can't be all that bad.
Find a solution.
We're newcomers.
I am exhausted.
I don't know why I was so nervous.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
I know what it's like to be alone.
I don't have any objection to that.
His book is famous not only in England but also in Japan.
Is that the train I have to take?
I know he will only continue disappointing me, but I can't help loving him.
I figured you might want this.
I don't want you to go.
Do you know who took the call?
What's your favorite color of hair?
It'll be easy.
He's the one who's lagging behind.
Get me something to eat.
Long story short, I was fired.
Heat turns ice into water.
Where's the nearest drugstore?
Don't walk out on me again.
I will do the shopping for her birthday.
I don't think I could live without you.
I don't like my job.
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
I think we're all a bit cuckoo.
My parents are very old fashioned.
I enjoy talking with you.
Excuse me, but where is the library?
She is traveling around the world.
You were removed from the list.
I don't even know why we're going.
Do you have any cash?
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
This is Room 839.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
This is my new video.
I've never been better.
Tom maintained that he was innocent.
They're out of town.
Let's finish the job.
Have you really already found a new job?
My watch is ten minutes fast.
He does not get up early.
We had so much fun together.
What does it look like?
I don't think this is funny.
It pays in the long run to buy goods of high quality.
Focus on your breathing.
My idea was much better.
I guess I shouldn't complain.
My cousin is a little older than I am.
He has a small advantage.
I'm going to do my best.
We have a cat. We all love cats.
Do you study English?
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
It was not long before we met again by chance.
What was he doing here?
We'll make an exception of your case.
I want to hear more.
Could you take a picture of us?
Let's sit down on that bench.
Tickets are available to the public for $30.
You said you didn't care.
We're concerned for your safety.
The patient's condition changes every day.
He stopped talking to them.
The Prime Minister's speech was calculated to anger the opposition parties.
Please make sure your seat belt is fastened.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
I was at your wedding.
It's a rule.
Tom couldn't have done it.
I am in a spot.
I'm disappointed and angry.
We're the best.
Do you want to resign?
I could kick myself for not bringing a map.
The zoo was closed on Christmas Day.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Do you sell desk lamps here?
I would like a word with you.
I'm looking for another job.
Would you care to come and see me on Saturday?
I thought you were smart.
You didn't eat much lunch, did you?
Are you seeing anybody?
Some parts of this city are very ugly.
A lot of people feel the same way Tom does.
Could you speak up? I can't hear you.
We need this report by tomorrow.
Compare the two carefully, and you will see the difference.
The party was a flop.
His ideas never earned him a dime.
Don't be a moron.
I bought this book at Kakuzen's.
I almost always do that in the afternoon.
Do you have time?
I've had enough of your snide remarks.
I don't think about it that much.
Clint Eastwood was elected mayor of Carmel.
Can you guys solve the puzzle?
We were busy.
Don't forget to mail this letter on your way to school.
You're very open.
Here is my key.
Tom knows that he's wrong, but he won't admit it.
I like running.
I made her a dress.
I feel like having some pizza tonight.
I lent my pencil to Tom.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Are you a Buddhist?
Go and see who it is.
I want to tell you about my problems.
English has borrowed numerous words from French.
You're not welcome here.
I think you've done enough.
They want a few more hours to finish the report.
Tom told us about his last trip to Boston.
It's all over.
Is this fish still alive?
I checked my bags.
You were all a big help.
I think you should open an account here.
Get up out of bed.
We should respect each other's beliefs.
I surrendered.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
She is always complaining of her job.
I'm going to study French next semester.
I'm busy with my homework.
Do you think I can use my cellphone in the shower?
English is spoken everywhere in the world now.
I'll leave it to you to buy the tickets.
Nothing is as important as peace.
The lake is deepest at this spot.
This is my beer.
You'd better see a dentist at once.
I don't think I could forgive myself if I did that.
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea.
Tom has a driver's license.
He's in hot water.
I hear laughing.
Everything he says is true.
Both Tom and Mary work as models.
Do tigers purr?
I'm trying my best.
The answer is yes.
She visits the dentist on a regular basis, so she seldom gets toothaches.
Who believes in God?
My cat is really smart.
I never saw Tom again.
Everyone in the class learned the poem by heart.
I'm only doing this for your own good.

Tom put some food into the dog's dish.
Tom couldn't find the bus stop.

Do you want to grab dinner?
You missed the meeting.
You aren't wrong.
We loved you.
Don't try to get up yet.
Mary is the girl of my dreams.
How soon will the bus come? "In five minutes."
I've thought a lot about this.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
I feel like having an ice cream.
I asked him his name.
He answered incorrectly.
The leaves fell from the trees.
My mouth is dry.
I remember having seen this movie before.
You must not leave right now.
Tom's not in a good mood.
I don't believe that's possible.
I ordered a book from London.
I write letters almost every day.
I assume we're doing a pretty good job since no one has complained.
I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow.
We're all scared.
Where do you live?
Either you or I will have to do it.
What kind of sports we play depends on the weather and the season.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
I went inside.
It just was not my day yesterday.
Tom wanted to die.
Could you speak a little louder please?
It took her a long time to choose a hat.
It is cold there, even in summer.
I'm drinking a beer.
Why do you always do that to me?
You're being watched.
What're you going to do during your summer vacation?
Tom answered the teacher's questions.
I said I'd be there.
Tom came too late.
I have nothing in common with her.
He laid his head on the pillow.
The horse is thirsty.
Take a screenshot of just the highlighted text.
That's all you need to know.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
Can I get you something to wet your whistle?
People don't say that anymore.
Kids do stupid things.
Open your mouth!
Why are you worried?
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
What will you have to do? asked her friend.
He is a jealous man.
You shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
The dog felt guilty about eating the homework.
You should buy yourself a new knife.
I managed to find his office.
They began to climb the hill.
It's not hard.
Pass me the wine.
Why would anybody want to hurt me?
We wish him the best in his future endeavors.
We've been up all night.
Better to extend an olive branch than launch a missile.
Tom's French is perfect.
I don't know who else to turn to for help.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Mary asked her family for a loan.
So, what do you say?
Tom is very different now.
You will obey us.
I've got them all.
Are you going to Tom's farewell party?
Will the train leave on time?
Well, you've convinced me.
Put it on the wall.
Tom was hit by a car and died.
How can you not remember?
Few students knew his name.
I don't have a sword.
No one will know.
I'm going to see Tom today.
How do I do that?
Tom is wiser than me.
We all stood up at once.
She took me under her wing and taught me everything she knows.
Could you please lend me your dictionary?
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
According to the paper, there was a big fire in Boston.
Are you frightened?
Tom is here because he wants to talk to Mary.
Tom has been retired for twenty years.
I wish we could settle this like adults.
Her attitude disgusts me.
Don't leave me here.
Tom's polite.
I have three choices.
I need it by tomorrow.
I've made peace with my maker. I'm ready to die.
It goes without saying that health is most important.
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
Acid eats into metal.
He's their only child.
The evidence is fairly conclusive.
I hate this game.
He is absent from school today.
I agree.
Have you decided what you're going to do?
That sounds scary.
I need to find Tom now.
This is a big deal.
Tom will never forgive us.
Our supply of food is exhausted.
It's too late.
As for me, I like chicken better than pork.
He's a slowpoke.
A coin dropped out of his pocket.
Keep your eyes closed.
There is no urgency.
I want you to get your own place.
Come immediately.
He claims to have visions from God.
He was perfect.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
I love you more deeply than I can say.
I wanted to see what would happen.
Recent advances in medicine are remarkable.
We packed everything.
Tom bought a new car yesterday.
Aren't you embarrassed?
She tried.
What illness do I have?
Stop acting like a child.
The number of students in the class is limited to fifteen.
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
This book is very popular among women.
Since I stayed up late, I'm very sleepy.
I want to see how it ends.
You're insane.
Please stick out your tongue.
I was excited.
School is boring.
They were peaceful.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
That's the last thing you want.
Let me write down the directions for you.
The bus was almost empty.
Your soul needs to be saved.
There are statues in the park.
I only wanted to be helpful.
Figure up how much it amounts to.
What's wrong with my idea?
The government appointed a committee to investigate the accident.
Why don't you go on a diet?
Could we have a spoon?
The doctor started to examine her.
Don't be so impatient.
I know Tom does that a lot.
I'm powerless.
These boots are expensive.
I guess we were happy back then.
She's a quiet person.
Clearly, that wasn't the case.
Tom told Mary to stop eating.
He's young and single.
Now, who has a question?
This year, Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday.
Now I realise why she was angry with me.
Tom goes jogging in the park every morning.
I'm supposed to do that by myself.
He disregarded my advice.
I'm not ugly.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
Smoking has affected his health.
I invited them to the party.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I live in comfort.
Tom claims he shot Mary in self defense.
Please turn off the light before you go to bed.
People have a tendency to underestimate their future needs.
I would rather have a cat than a dog.
Are you bored?
I have a stuffed-up nose.
We had lots of fun today.
Is there a mall near here?
What's your biggest fear?
The baby is asleep.
That's really sad.
Tom didn't drink much.
Don't tell anyone about our plan.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Give her a doll.
Are they really serious?
You make me sick.
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
If Tom needs help, we can give it to him.
You're too tense.
What bothers me is his attitude.
She sang as she walked.
You're not allowed in here.
I'm not buying it.
You shouldn't trust Tom.
You're safe here.
Sorry, I couldn't catch what you said.
Everybody was stunned.
That's enough for today. I'm tired.
I'll assist you.
I've tried.
The door was locked, so I couldn't get in.
Tom looked at the floor.
Show me how to do that.
I made friends with them at the school festival.
They're right, of course.
Lightning struck Tom's house.
I'm not giving you any more money.
I'm almost sure of it.
The house is not occupied now.
Someone screamed.
We should've gotten up earlier.
He was sentenced to community service.
Would you mind if I took a break?
I'm sending you a birthday present by airmail.
How deep?
It'll cost over a thousand yen.
That's enough.
He works for a bank.
I saw Tom at the funeral today.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were members of the middle class.
The book costs 4 dollars.
I've heard this story scores of times.
I plan to tell Tom about you.
You've got to wake up.
My feelings for you haven't changed.
My shift's over.
Hang that picture on the wall.
You know that I'm married.
Are you ready to go out?
There are a lot of things I have to do.
Let me ask you a stupid question.
I've learned a little French.
It was once thought that there was intelligent life on Mars.
I am very busy these days.
Please tell me. I really want to hear it.
I put it on your desk.
The campers were hard up for water because their well had run dry.
We want a new carpet.
Turn him down once and for all.
We're not dating.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
Generally speaking, boys like girls with long hair.
He is able to speak ten languages.
He sent me a birthday card.
He seems to be ill.
Tom lives on the same street as me.
Stop playing hard to get.
I beg to differ.
I reacted instinctively.
That sort of flattery will get you nowhere.
Tom is wearing gloves, isn't he?
Yesterday, Tom was in a bad mood all day.
I didn't know you were rich.
I have amnesia.
How do you tell each other apart?
He earns a great deal.
I'm not understanding anything.
Press the green button. If you do so, the light will go on.
I may have hurt his feelings.
What are these for?
No one's convinced.
This fish is not edible.
Natural food will do you good.
This doesn't concern you.
Thank you very much for your present.
How did I get into this?
I'd like to get started right away.
I gave him advice, to which he paid no attention.
I never had a girlfriend before.
It was a great trip.
The sky is cloudy today.
Pay attention to what you're doing.
She has no chances of coming in contact with foreigners.
She's got a good eye for paintings.
Do you take me for a fool?
Make some noise!
She apologized to him for being late.
That's why I quit.
It's five o'clock.
She cooked some fish for me.
I need new tires.
Can you spell it?
That market has been rapidly expanding.
How do you know I don't know?
This stays between you and me.
Tom renamed the folder.
Your wish will come true in the near future.
Are you sure we've never met before?
I just want what's best for you.
I have already finished reading this book.
The bus is full.
I'm not the only one who feels that way.
I require your assistance.
Miniskirts have been out of date for some time.
I need to be left alone.
Are you going to school?
You deserve this.
You're the boss.
I hope to pass my exams.
Let me make you a cup of hot coffee.
I can't stay here any longer.
He is Japanese by birth.
I should've taken an umbrella with me.
Tom lives in the same apartment building as Mary does.
We don't have a daughter.
Tom is wiser than I am.
Don't you want to go?
Go grab a drink.
He has greasy hair.
It would be nice if it stopped raining.
I had a very high fever.
Your daughter overheard us talking.
Please don't touch this.
I gave Tom a hug.
Let me explain.
I like studying French.
I just know that it's not right.
I'm a hero.
That is our school.
We're better than they are.
She is busy preparing for the trip.
The whole town was in an uproar.
The vase was broken to pieces.
Did you get it?
She goes to school on foot.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
Her only desire is to see him again soon.
Don't disappoint me the way you did the other day.
You need to be here for your family.
Take a whiff.
Tom is still hungry, isn't he?
I'm pleased with their performance.
Am I talking too fast?
They're all terrified.
Be careful what you wish for.
I can't remember all their names.
I wonder what the next question will be.
I made a sandwich for you.
You must think this is funny.
Don't try to be a hero.
I'd like to speak with Tom in private for a moment.
I want to start learning French.
Ukrainian girls are the most beautiful girls in the world.
The Industrial Revolution took place first in England.
He tried harder to get good marks than I did.
What do you call this?
How did you lose it?
Good luck. You'll need it.
You must not think about your immediate profit only.
We love our country.
It's been almost ten years, but you're as beautiful as ever.
Tom's wife died last week.
His eyes failed him.
Would you be interested in having dinner with me?
Hasn't he looked at himself in a mirror?
You don't seem to be as organized as Tom seems to be.
Finish drinking your milk.
I don't agree with the government's policy on education.
Are you trying to kill me?
I'll just leave.
He remembers writing to her every week.
Let me kiss you one last time.
I'm very happy with my purchase.
She's a very nice girl.
I want to finish the work on my own.
The guards found a hacksaw blade in the prisoner's pocket.
I want my children to be happy.
I needed your help on something, but I couldn't find you.
Tom and Mary were talking in French.
I have fewer books than you.
I lost the watch that my father gave me.
Tom asked us to be patient.
You're very astute.
That was really weird.
I don't want to see you anymore.
The new government has financial troubles.
Will you take me there?
I will come to your country some day.
When do you plan to check out?
I'll do all the talking.
Thanks for the food.
He studies hardest of all the students.
I need friends.
Could you please help me?
I believe in friendship.
He is an expert in astronomy.
This is my book, not yours.
How much money do I owe you?
I came to kill him.
Where's the oar?
Tom doesn't want to be disappointed.
I won't let you die.
They abandoned the sinking ship.
My band will perform this week at Chuck's Bar and Grill. Please come and see us.
We see what we want to see.
I want to see you in my office.
I can't blame you for dreaming.
I refused to believe it.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
I'd rather she sat next to me.
I'm not from here.
I'm glad that's over.
Be yourself.
It's easier to teach children than adults.
The train for Birmingham leaves from platform 3.
You're satisfied.
The feeling's mutual.
The problem resolved itself.
Have you been listening to me?
She got into the car and drove off.
I was surprised by Tom's strength.
Tom doesn't want to get his hands dirty.
They're really ugly.
What exactly don't you get?
I told you the truth.
I really hurried.
I thought I told you to stay in the car.
When I saw her recently, she looked very happy.
We might die.
The army forced him to resign.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
We happened to take the same train.
What's your last name?
You are so stupid.
We don't want to take anything.
Maybe Tom left early.
The man lost all hope.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
I know this is hard for you.
She assumed an air of indifference.
Do men cry?
The chicken is overcooked.
Let's look under the bed.
It doesn't matter how much it costs.
Let's do something.
Tom strangled Mary with a rope.
It frosted last night.
Nobody knows how I feel.
May I go?
I relaxed.
I wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression about me.
Sorry, I've got my hands full now.
Good medicine tastes bitter.
Where's my tie?
I know you did this.
You are in over your head.
You were afraid, weren't you?
How did it get here?
You shouldn't read such useless books.
Let's stop and take a rest.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
They went whale watching.
Do we have a choice?
I don't make as much money as I'd like to.
I leave home before eight o'clock every morning.
The man hit me on the head.
I should've told you.
A baby is incapable of taking care of itself.
I'll leave it up to you.
He was excommunicated.
You're very curious.
What have we done?
Do you have a shovel I can borrow?
I remember the day you were born very well.
Do you think I'm being unreasonable?
The flag is up.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
Are you seriously thinking about becoming involved?
You're not alone.
Are we finished?
He pushed me gently.
It's made of leather.
I just want this to be over.
I'm sure that I can do that.
This country deserves better.
I know that you don't know how to speak French.
I felt reborn.
That was the only thing I could do.
She makes her mother happy.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
Turn down the music.
What they said to you is exactly the opposite of what they told me yesterday.
Let's go into the garden.
Eat your soup while it is hot.
The plane was approaching London.
I have no idea what you mean.
Surround yourself only with people who are going to lift you higher.
I don't have many friends.
Would you consider taking care of my children next Saturday?
Somebody's having a good day.
Are you ready to leave?
Everything he says upsets me.
I'll save you.
Tom is in the park.
That sounds reasonable.
That's what I was working on.
They'll be back soon.
I canceled my appointment because of urgent business.
We're winners.
Do you want more milk in your coffee?
Are you still jealous?
You should eat.
Tom will continue.
I like summer holidays better than school.
She said she was happy.
Stay right where you are.
You are very smart.
People shouldn't stare at foreigners.
They'll grow.
It's difficult to teach people what they're unwilling to learn.
iTunes has turned out to be a real cash cow for Apple.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
I wash my hands before eating lunch.
If he'd known the truth, he'd have told me.
That's very sweet of you.
They're useless.
Stop where you are.
It's about time you got married.
Which browser are you using?
In my city, the temperature is one degree above zero.
Why don't you come over and eat with us this evening?
Take the road on the right.
I want to talk to you about this report.
They cannot be saved.
I want your answer by the end of the day.
I want you to come right over.
How did you vote on that matter?
I hope your brother is better.
Make sure you cut the board against the grain.
Get me the details.
We should be proud of ourselves.
I hope you know the last thing I want to do is go there without your permission.
She gave me a pretty doll.
If I were in your situation, I would do the same thing.
I don't care who Tom is talking to.
We have to get something to eat.
We really hope that you'll be there.
Tom ignored Mary all morning.
Please go right away.
He turned a somersault.
I am divorced.
He is alert to every chance of making money.
I don't think that we should do that.
Everyone seems to agree.
You should not go alone.
What do you want to do in the afternoon?
How did you arrive at this conclusion?
I don't know what you want me to say.
The medicine made me feel better.
If that doesn't work, try something else.
No one believed him.
I go to church every Sunday.
The streets were quiet.
If I were you, I wouldn't do such a thing.
Be merciful.
You're on the wrong road.
I couldn't explain to Tom what was happening.
I didn't say it happened here.
Everybody's dead.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
Did I give you the tickets?
Tom told us to take our time.
Could I please have a glass of water?
I don't own a television.
How about your father?
She divided the cake between the two.
Are you sure Tom is here?
I know you've been trying to help.
I fully understand your concerns.
I wasn't the one who wrote this.
You're overworked.
It was stupid of me to make such a mistake.
I have to stay in bed all day.
I almost always take a shower in the morning before going to school.
He had a new idea.
I nailed it.
I want to be on the other team.
We must see the matter in its proper perspective.
Not everyone is like you.
He has a lot more money than I have.
Come and help us.
I usually eat outside.
Thank you for stopping by.
The rain prevented me from going out.
I wasn't hungry anyway.
That's a great poem.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
Tom told me that he wasn't afraid of Mary.
He sold all his land.
Everybody hates me.
Maybe I need a new assistant.
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
I'm looking forward to doing that.
Be careful!
Could you come to tomorrow's meeting?
I know what Tom and Mary are going through.
You did the right thing.
Leave a comment.
They refused to think of leaving.
That's not my computer.
We don't lock our doors.
Do you think I'm crazy?
I am new here.
I was incredibly bored.
Do you want me to come cook you something?
She met her uncle.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
Smile at the camera, please!
I really don't feel good.
Tom told me a lot about you.
Flour is made from wheat.
Tom told Mary to keep that a secret.
Tom told me to be more careful.
It was here that I saw her.
She doesn't do anything else.
The cops are searching for the missing documents.
Tom isn't married anymore.
I don't think this is a problem.
She is not up yet.
No one knows what'll happen in the future.
Don't take me for granted.
He was the only one not invited to the party.
Would you carry this up to the second floor for me?
Why is Tom studying French?
Everything is now ready for you.
Tom didn't have to thank me.
Those men are armed to the teeth.
He completely failed to understand why she got angry.
The problem will eventually solve itself.
I think Tom believed me.
The police drew an outline of a body at the scene of the crime to indicate how the body was lying when it was found.
Can we be of any further assistance?
I'm already ready.
He got what he deserved.
My father stopped smoking.
What did they hit you with?
I remember you.
Who's not coming?
Tom eats at least three bowls of rice every day.
I nearly got hit by a truck today.
You're forgiven.
We sometimes meet them.
Tom turned on the light in the dining room.
Tom isn't crying.
That's what you told me.
I'm not that surprised by it.
You were always very kind.
The bus leaves every ten minutes.
How much is the car that you're planning to buy?
There was no damage.
Can you tell us how that'll work?
She always arrives on time.
Read the label carefully.
What's troubling you?
I have nothing to do with their troubles.
The car broke down.
I asked Tom what he'd advise.
Some people laugh at his jokes, but others don't.
I know I shouldn't have done that.
I need a map.
He promised to marry her.
Do you know who that guy is?
I guess that's not such a big secret.
Are you free in the afternoon?
I know the answer already.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Tom put the sign to the wall.
Life can be hard.
I can't express my feelings.
It's no wonder Tom's sleeping poorly; he drinks up to twelve cups of coffee a day.
Don't let him know her address.
Tom has three daughters.
I can help you chart the course, but you have to make the journey on your own.
Art is not a luxury, but a necessity.
Did he get a receipt?
Long skirts are out of fashion now.
Can I try on this pair of shoes?
She says she's not dating anyone now, but I don't believe her.
Looking at your Facebook friends' photos is a waste of time.
I was given a nice watch by my uncle.
You're not allowed in this room.
I'm afraid that I might be late.
They're clean.
They're dancing.
Tom was talking to Mary.
To drive a car, you need a license.
These books are Tom's.
Where can I try this on?
I'll talk to him at the earliest possible moment.
Take his car keys.
The committee meets twice a month.
Tom became a minister.
There were only six people at the meeting.
Do you know who drank my coffee?
She nuzzled up against her boyfriend.
Tom said Mary was stupid.
We have to draw a line somewhere.
I want you to dig a hole.
You've really earned this.
He gambled on the war coming to an early end.
It's making me nostalgic.
Do you think our team will win?
Please reconsider.
I'm not at all busy.
Wait in the car, OK?
What songs are you going to sing tonight?
I really need to go.
How dare you call me stupid!
Most boys take after their fathers.
He came to Japan two years ago.
I can't take that chance.
I'm glad to be here.
It's just possible that he'll eventually recover the use of his legs.
You have no right to say that.
He is ashamed of his father being poor.
We're a group.
I saw how Tom did it.
He treated me badly.
I shut the drawer.
This time is no different.
No one knows what has become of her.
I don't expect you to understand this.
You must show respect to your guests.
They did the right thing.
He keeps his age a secret.
Their modest income doesn't allow for many luxuries.
Who discovered America?
That's the best thing that could happen to me.
I do this every day.
No one says that.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
Many young people were present at the party.
He came back after dark.
We haven't yet discussed which method is better.
You should've done that by yourself.
You're all mad.
A stone does not float.
No one believes me.
The situation is very complicated.
Please say yes.
It's not cold today.
I know you want to help him.
I'll pay you a visit sometime.
The paper wasn't important.
You took advantage of me.
Tell me what really happened.
I'll call you right after the meeting.
Friendship is more precious than anything else.
We're dying.
He described his own experience.
What time do you go to school?
I don't think it'll be hard to do that.
I don't want either of them.
My tooth hurts.
I have nothing to say right now.
Did I hurt your feelings?
He's going to pay me back next week.
I'm feeling good.
It's not broken.
The talks should begin soon.
She advised him against doing it.
You're winning, aren't you?
I like trains better than buses.
You need sleep.
You ought not to make fun of them.
Hunger is the best sauce.
Would you draw me a map?
You're not finished.
Don't you agree?
She lacks common sense.
What grade did you get on the test?
I don't know where I am exactly.
Do you know how to use a computer?
I'd like a room facing the ocean instead.
I can't see a thing.
Yesterday I bought a horse
I don't want to speak with Tom.
I can hardly breathe.
I don't think she takes after her mother.
That's the last thing I want to do.
I have no place to sleep tonight.
I'm not going to call Tom.
She went out without saying goodbye.
Don't let this information leak out.
I found it necessary to get up early every morning.
I know that Tom is a pharmacist.
Tom is old school.
You're not here, so I'm really sad.
Tom will be back from Australia soon.
You saw that movie, didn't you?
I promise you won't be disappointed.
You shouldn't eat raw snails.
I was thinking about the plan.
It's a very difficult situation.
This big sofa is really not suitable for a small room.
You owe it to those who are dependent upon you to do this.
I don't really like him.
We've got to take Tom to the doctor.
It's probably just a phase.
I want you to handle it.
Where did you take these photos?
Tom said he wouldn't buy any of Mary's paintings.
I don't have time to talk.
She married him for his money.
They are Christians.
Tom has to go even if it rains.
I'll be busy next week.
If I create an example, will you correct it for me?
It's later than you think.
Who died?
Never tell lies.
Tom certainly doesn't seem to mind helping Mary.
The mirror is on top of the dresser.
If there were no telephones, it would be inconvenient.
I do not like any of these hats.
Close the door, please.
The snow prevented us from arriving on time.
I've put on weight.
I never thought about that.
There is a friendly atmosphere in the office.
That's hers.
Can you take Tom to the airport?
I'd like to sing a song for you that I just wrote.
Tom promised to tell the truth.
Would you mind giving me a little help with some problems I'm having?
Tom teaches French.
You look like you're enjoying yourself.
I downloaded it.
I hate surprises.
Do you understand me?
This watch is less expensive than that one.
Where exactly did you go?
Do you feel lucky?
This time, you won't avoid your punishment.
I'm pleased with his performance.
Did they say how?
It is not my intent to hurt you in any way.
Stop worrying about it.
I've already made that mistake.
There are a lot of beautiful places in Japan.
I'll do what you ask.
Give me a little time to think.
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.
Would you mind if I borrowed this?
You don't sound very confident.
It was pretty incredible.
Why did you put off the printing of my book?
You recognize her, don't you?
Let's check one more time.
Yours is not bad, either.
He is eager to please.
I was as surprised as you.
Whether you like it or not doesn't matter.
Tom wears a wig.
He's self-employed.
He meant no harm.
Everybody is relying on you.
She likes music very much.
I really don't want to talk about it.
Be quiet and listen to me.
Don't expect overtime.
I thought about giving my saxophone to Tom as a gift.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
They went there.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
I won't eat breakfast tomorrow.
He jumped out of bed.
We may not win tomorrow.
Can I try this on?
He applied for the job and got it.
I agree completely.
Is this legal?
Please come in.
What is your profession?
Do you have a problem with me?
You'll never guess what happened to me today.
Why's Tom still here?
Help me out, would you?
He's hungry for power.
I can fix it.
You're not as young as you used to be.
If you listen closely enough you'll be able to hear it.
This would be a good place to raise kids.
Who has it?
He is running short of funds.
Aren't we lucky?
Was that an insult?
Stay calm.
Tom can stay.
We discussed the problem far into the night.
Tom is taller than his mother.
How many caps do you own?
I'll never understand you.
That hit the spot.
As far as I'm concerned, things are going well.
I am counting on your help.
Please tell me your location.
He touched my shoulder.
Where were you coming from?
He's going to sit here.
You have no taste.
I thought it might be you.
He told me not to smoke.
We can't see anything.
What time will you get to the station?
They are boiling water for tea.
All of us live in the same dorm.
Don't bother to call me.
They just beat us.
We've been asked to not do this anymore.
I just panicked.
You don't believe Tom, do you?
What do you say you join me for dinner?
There are many Americans who can speak Japanese.
I just want to help you.
What are you trying to say?
Tom and Mary danced all evening.
I would rather stay at home than go out in the rain.
The idea is stupid anyway.
I plan to move to Boston.
We have to make sure that we never do this again.
I am not equal to the task.
I'm older than you think I am.
I'm an artist.
Nature plays an important role in our life.
You'd better be careful what you say.
My grandfather cannot walk without a walking stick.
Top-down economics never works, said Obama. "The country does not succeed when just those at the very top are doing well. We succeed when the middle class gets bigger, when it feels greater security."
My great aunt was a staunch teetotaler.
Don't worry.
I go for a walk every day, except when it rains.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
They watched me in silence.
I'm all yours.
I have plenty of friends.
At last, my wish has come true.
It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice.
I left my card at home.
I sincerely hope not.
Move out of my way.
You guys are no fun.
I can no longer remain silent.
That message was sent by Tom.
You like Boston, don't you?
No one was in the room.
My back is killing me.
Would you like another glass of ice tea?
Ants and giraffes are distant cousins.
Judging from the look on his face, it seems that he has succeeded.
Can you account for your absence last Friday?
He removed his sunglasses.
In short, all our efforts resulted in nothing.
I really need to talk to someone.
You must turn in your old license in order to get a new one.
I hear you were grounded.
You were supposed to do that yesterday.
I waited for an hour, but he didn't appear.
Do you recognize that girl?
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
Can your mother drive a car?
We were younger then.
Remember not to tell anyone.
He was kind enough to show me the way to the station.
The explanation of each fact took a long time.
I feel like I've known you forever.
I think I've found something of yours.
I wanted to watch you die.
Let's begin.
We have no special plans.
I don't think it'll rain, but I'll take an umbrella just in case it does.
I wanted you to have a little fun.
Tom doesn't want you to get hurt.
We need to take this into account.
I'm a little child.
The cookies were delicious.
We all need to stay together.
Get out of the truck.
We heard the sound of gunshots.
You don't frighten me.
You can't have both books.
Your wife's on the phone. She says it's urgent.
I want you to come and get me.
I'd like for you to leave.
I had no idea you were involved.
Why don't you take the day off?
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
What are you trying to hide?
The ball rolled on the ground towards me.
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
The results for the English exam this time were very good.
I'm all by myself.
I didn't really mean that.
Tom is at school.
I look forward to hearing from you.
I must admit that I've never heard of it.
Am I talented?
Did you sleep in here?
Are you an idiot?
I was unable to go to his birthday party.
Tom slapped Mary.
What is your offer?
Did you love Tom?
The city center should be closed to all but pedestrian traffic.
I like to be here.
We could write a book.
As soon as she saw me, she greeted me with a smile.
This book is boring.
I know that things haven't been easy for you.
Never have I seen such a thing.
I'm all ears.
I found a note on my door from Tom.
She asked me to come to her bedside.
I'm very worried about you.
You're not a suspect.
The war brought their research to an end.
Don't call anybody.
It must've been expensive.
Both Tom and I aren't busy.
What should I name it?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I still love you.
That's not the point.
I want everyone to be there.
Stay out of this.
I don't like bad boys.
Come in, Tom.
The prices are high.
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
I'd like a cup of tea, please.
See what I mean?
I couldn't make myself understood.
What are you doing in here?
Everything is great.
I'd love to go with you to the show, but I'm flat broke.
Tom told me that Mary was on a diet.
He can't walk any more.
Could you turn it down?
He pretended to be asleep.
I couldn't stay even if I wanted to.
They're mine.
I've no idea what's happening.
What's all the excitement about?
It seems like we're going to be a little late.
His hobby is collecting old stamps.
It's a mistake that many people make.
What were you doing that moment?
You're the teacher.
No problem!
That movie star has many fans.
Mom, can Tom stay for dinner?
Can you drive a five speed?
I want to know what you're doing here.
I'm surprised Tom won.
I'll study harder in the future.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
Tom's boss is very demanding.
I called for help.
It's in the fridge.
I took a picture of her.
I got upset.
Tom is here to protect me.
She was loved by everybody in the village.
How did I miss this?
Do you like his songs?
I brought you this.
I'm going there today.
Tom says he has nothing to hide.
They say that you never get over your first love.
You would be safe there.
How could you agree to doing that without consulting me?
You are too critical of others' shortcomings.
They blocked her.
I think you'll find this interesting.
I like your mirror.
Tom doesn't need to wait any longer.
He hates shopping.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
It's very dark in here.
Are you relaxed?
He is looking at what used to be my father's desk.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
That a boy!
Her behavior at the party was far from perfect.
There were only three survivors.
She did her best to rescue him.
I'm glad to be of some help to you.
I appeal to you to contribute to the new clinic.
Someone must've left the window open.
Do we really have to go home so early?
I blew the candle out.
I don't drink alcohol.
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
I have to consider every possibility.
I'll keep my promise.
I know you were born in Boston.
He was always trying to provoke an argument.
He lacks confidence.
My parrot flew away.
The lights are out.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
She seems happy.
I want you to find out about that.
He's still single.
I could have done it by myself.
You both did well.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Did you push the button?
I am exhausted.
I used to be your age.
She advised him to take a rest, but he didn't follow her advice.
It was the best party ever.
As we grow older, our memory becomes weaker.
She is popular with other girls.
Why did you decide to do that?
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
The police kept looking for a stolen article for about one month.
It's something new.
I'm really impressed with the way Tom plays the saxophone.
We had fun with it.
Do you remember your grandfather?
He looks nothing like a doctor.
Tom and Mary enjoy being together.
I never said you were boring.
Do you have a Twitter account?
He is rarely in a good mood.
I was too afraid to do anything.
She made a good speech.
I never use my camera anymore. I just take pictures with my phone.
You said I was beautiful.
When does the bank close?
She was supposed to call him at 2:30.
You must be kidding!
This is probably a real diamond.
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit.
What does she have?
The door was locked and we couldn't get in.
He's unconscious.
I make a good living.
You're finicky.
This is nice.
She called for help.
You don't see that every day.
Smoking stinks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I was unable to go to his birthday party.
He needs a few jokes to lighten up his talk.
I wouldn't sell that at any price.
Come on, answer quickly.
Did you write this book?
Do you have anything else to add?
I don't want to live here by myself.
I didn't finish reading that book.
I'd like to brush my teeth.
If that accident had happened in a city, it would have caused a disaster.
I'm definitely going crazy.
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
We ran out of gas in the middle of the intersection.
Who can say what will happen in the future?
You should be more careful the next time.
What a phony!
He deprived my little sister of all her toys.
Who could've predicted this?
I'm dedicated.
I took off my coat.
Love is stronger than death.
I'm free now.
I'm afraid I have internal bleeding.
You should really lay off that. It'll ruin your health.
Tom doesn't realize how lucky he is.
You were incompetent.
She sold all of her furniture, so she could afford to feed herself and her dog.
They're going to have a look.
Would you please stop singing?
What're you doing now?
My girlfriend dumped me.
He hates himself.
He talks well.
You don't have to respond.
How much is the rent?
What's your daughter's name?
I want to make sure there is enough.
His plane leaves for Hong Kong at 2:00 p.m.
I saw a man with a child.
Tom might testify.
The book is on the table.
When did you finish writing the letter?
This is the boy who found your watch.
Water reflects light.
He is going to study English next week.
I don't want to be your friend.
That's how I injured my ankle.
I can't stand it anymore.
Let's not let that happen again.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Can you tell me why Tom isn't here?
Don't answer that.
You don't know them.
He opened the door.
Tuck your shirt in.
The crowd is growing larger and larger.
I am to meet him at six.
Is there something in particular that you want to drink?
They're arguing.
I think we should concentrate on other things.
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?
Did anyone care?
Selling cars is my business.
I want you to come back early.
Tom visited four countries.
How dare you accuse me of lying!
Tom is a daydreamer.
Please fill out this form and wait for us to notify you.
We saw you.
We must hurry.
It's a hassle trying to decide what to wear to the party.
He keeps on asking me for money.
I gave you fair warning.
I'm doing the right thing.
It is better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
It was a group effort.
Nothing has changed.
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
Last winter, I went to Canada to ski.
I'll have to work hard.
I finished my sandwich.
Are you going to be OK?
There's nothing like close combat to test one's mettle.
I've changed my daily routine.
We're having some guests over this evening.
Are you sick? You look pale.
I have to fight.
I kicked the dog.
He thanked me for coming.
He caught her by the arm.
I don't think he can handle the truth.
Tom knows he did something wrong.
You may go there.
Don't try to do too much.
Which hat do you want to buy?
I think I can do it in my spare time.
What's this smell?
I figured that you weren't coming.
She took advantage of my ignorance.
You should apologize to Tom for being late.
I'm so embarrassed.
What don't you have?
They are talking over a cup of coffee in the cafeteria.
Did I wake you up?
Languages aren't his forte.
I cut class.
The light was on.
I asked for a seat in the non-smoking section.
They're students.
The huge tanker has just left the dock.
When you come back, I'll be gone.
That was really important.
How do you think I can convince her to spend more time with me?
He thinks he knows everything.
Where did you go for spring break?
We didn't have money for that.
It was Tom's idea.
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
This car runs on alcohol.
I like coffee hot.
The sky became darker and darker.
On hearing the news of the birth of his first child, he jumped for joy.
Are we leaving soon?
It's a true story.
You might be the only one who can do that.
You don't look like a millionaire.
I love the way you talk.
This bird cannot fly.
Why would that make a difference?
Don't read my journal.
She was advised by him to go to the police.
Don't let them get to you.
If he is proficient in English, I'll employ him.
You're supposed to do that.
May I ask you to do me a favor?
No one informed me of his failure.
It may rain at any moment.
I didn't think it was a problem.
I am dying for a cold drink.
You should throw this away.
They're young and healthy.
They arrived at the hotel.
Do you ever think about that guy?
I want to ride a horse.
Could I borrow your eyeliner?
I came to give you this.
What has changed since then?
I would like a piece of cheese.
I'm just looking around.
There is no salt left.
She's the breadwinner in this family.
Wake up.
I can't live without her.
Were you born there?
I want to buy my car back.
Tom hasn't told me who helped Mary.
I don't know what else to try.
It'll break.
Tom was all smiles.
His room is always tidy.
I don't want to get my clothes dirty.
I studied English when I was there.
Tom insisted that I go.
What alleviates the pain?
I suppose you want to ask me where I've been.
I'm not really busy.
I felt uncomfortable.
You can't help me.
I'm tidy.
You're free to go.
I know nothing about her except that she is a pianist.
There's a policeman outside who wants to see you.
Did you see anyone leave?
I'm done listening to you.
You can't do anything right, can you?
If what you say is true, it follows that he has an alibi.
She is my dream girl.
Can you show us how to do that?
World War One had ended just 15 years earlier.
I just want to help.
Where can we get lunch?
Are you retired, Tom?
I don't want to hear it.
I've got a lot of friends at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
It's a good start, don't you think?
Answer my question carefully.
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
I'll call the chef.
He often quotes from Shakespeare.
You can always text Tom.
I got it for nothing.
He had to reduce the price of his wares.
Excuse me.
This is a rental car.
We've made progress.
Tom followed me to the garage.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
Are you busy now?
Do you know what to do if there's a fire in the building?
Who do you trust?
Many small companies went bankrupt.
I wish I could sing like Tom.
He has his own room.
I have not been busy for two days.
Your ideas are always appreciated.
I thought we had an understanding.
It is cloudy now.
When will we get there?
Tom asked me if I was sleepy.
She looked at me seductively.
I've waited two whole hours. I can't wait any longer.
Are you absolutely sure of that?
Because my mother is sick, my father will cook today.
Boil some water.
Stop being so nice.
Would you lend me some money?
I remember laughing.
What happened at that intersection?
We went to the park to take pictures.
Is there another way in?
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
They're clean.
Tom is very unpredictable when he's been drinking.
He'll be safe with me.
What are you cooking?
I'll do it in the morning.
I asked him if he was busy.
The Dutch flag is red, white and blue.
They canceled.
Tom left me.
You keep out of this.
Do you really want to buy a car now?
Put down the rifle.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I translated everything Tom wrote into French.
A lot of people hate you already.
Are you following me?
I don't eat breakfast.
When I was your age, I had a girlfriend.
Draw a line from A to B.
I arrived here yesterday.
There were many things that we wanted to do, but we never got around to doing many of them.
If only I had known the answer yesterday!
Be careful not to break the eggs.
They grow flowers in the garden.
How does it feel to be a mother?
You were jealous, weren't you?
Tom ate a lot more than me.
I like picnics.
I'm an actress, not a model.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I thought it was stupid.
That's all.
The boy was absent from school yesterday because he was sick.
What are you doing today?
That he is a genius is clear to everyone.
She is in an awful mood.
Tom is a really good guy.
Tom doesn't know how to drive a manual.
You were so strong.
The house has been bought.
I'll give that a try.
Two years went by before I could find a good job.
I'd like to go for a walk.
Some people don't go to a doctor because they can't afford to.
This train stops at all stations.
Tom is an amateur photographer.
I'll have to call you back.
Grab this.
I got five hours sleep last night.
I'm already in a lot of trouble.
Do you gamble?
There is nothing new under the sun.
Did you understand any of that?
There is another way.
I'll be with you in a second.
Strive to be happy.
I don't want to take on any more work.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
I really need to hit somebody.
Money is the last thing he wants.
It was horrendous.
Please let me stay.
It doesn't have to be like this.
I'm as hungry as a bear.
We hope to see you again.
I'm delighted to hear that.
It's a little bit dangerous.
I thought you did fairly well.
I've got to get back home by midnight.
I was afraid of being put into a closet.
She nursed him back to health.
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
He often appears on TV.
Tom is probably in the building.
I want to name the baby after you.
The others need to be warned.
The music carried me back to my childhood.
Here is where it all happens.
Tom moved to Boston three years ago.
It took exactly an hour.
I appreciate your concern.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
Tom can't forgive Mary for what she did.
I'm getting old.
I don't know if I've ever told you, but you have beautiful eyes.
We're jealous.
One thing led to another.
She got very angry with her children.
No citizen should be deprived of his rights.
My driving instructor says that I need to be more patient.
Tom ignored our advice.
Aren't you the one who's always saying we should spend more time together?
If you don't eat fast, you'll be late for school.
Were you sincere?
I am in trouble.
I want you to tell me who gave you that.
Tom and Mary entered the church together.
Obviously, she's sick.
Tom can't have said that.
I never thought I'd find a woman like you.
Tom backed out of the room.
I don't know if I should tell him.
She will be a famous artist in the future.
The boys were injured.
Are you both crazy?
I don't think it's my decision alone.
He will come back to Japan in the middle of May.
She tried to comfort him, but he kept crying.
What did I ever do to you?
I want to clean the house before my parents return.
It's the end of the year.
Have you lost your ticket?
We are under his command.
I've never seen Tom do what you say he always does.
This is all a mistake.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
She is her own worst enemy.
This watch was your grandfather's.
I'll follow you wherever you go.
She translated that word for word.
I can't see anything with my right eye.
I can't wait for him any longer.
Tom is an active person.
Please give me a cup of coffee.
Not much money is required.
Why didn't you listen to me?
I will explain the situation to you later on.
Tom will go, too, won't he?
What should we do with this?
Tom forgot to pay his rent.
Tom is taller than Mary.
You have to go.
We made a good impression, I think.
My friend asked me if I was feeling all right.
Skating on the pond is dangerous.
I can't find my umbrella.
That'll be all.
There was nothing to drink.
I brought you this.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
I was naive.
Life as it is is very uninteresting to him.
I'm not sure this is a good idea.
Go look for it.
You seem upset.
It's very dangerous.
He stopped drinking.
Would you accept those terms?
He drinks to excess.
Could you please tell me your height and weight?
Tom put on a pair of latex gloves.
He's a journalist.
I just want to look at it, that's all.
Why don't we drive out to the country for a change of pace?
This tea is very good.
We need to find somewhere to hide.
We're going shopping.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
Tom opened the safe.
Would you care for a little wine?
Is there a contradiction there?
I picked you some flowers.
I haven't broken any laws.
I am 18 years old.
I brought you another blanket.
It's still not right.
Everyone except me knew it.
Did I hear you right?
Everything matters.
Parents love their children.
I had a fender bender on my way to work.
Do you love me?
Seize him!
I don't want to see him, let alone go out with him.
I know someone who has never seen the ocean.
I never thought you'd become a doctor.
She pulled him out of the mud.
Stay here all night if you want.
I don't know the reason why he went there.
They talked about culture.
I've got to see you.
You can't handle this alone.
This is annoying.
Tom couldn't answer the last question.
You can do it if you try.
Tom bought himself a new sports car.
I think that's a hoax.
They'll find us.
She became drowsy after supper.
A small gain is better than a great loss.
It's stealing.
They can't hear you.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
I lead a busy life.
Are you going to take part in the contest?
How long are you going to be seeing that loser of a boyfriend?
You're callous.
I had hoped we might become friends.
How's it going? "Not too bad."
The bus will take you to the center of the city.
He told me he wanted to quit the company.
Tom lit the candles.
I guess you didn't quite understand me.
We discussed the article I published.
Tom forgot his umbrella in his car.
Don't let the cat out of the bag.
Tom didn't seem serious.
He chose the wrong man to pick a fight with.
Without your help, I would have failed.
I'm glad you met Tom.
I was shaken.
We haven't yet decided what to do tomorrow.
I think they're ready.
I don't mind a bit.
I thought you were dead.
Why don't we go out and get drunk?
I don't want you two talking about me.
I ordered the book from England.
I'm ruthless.
It's hard to believe.
The flood deposited a layer of mud.
We got lost in the fog.
I'd study harder if I were you.
Can we go inside?
She tried a third time.
I couldn't be happier for the two of you.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
I believed you.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
Can I get you anything?
The prince became a king that day.
Do you see what I mean?
Has anybody solved this mystery?
Try to find out if everything he said is true.
He tricked me.
They studied the map to find a short cut.
She is the one you should model yourself after.
I would also like to rent a car.
You can go back.
Tom is too young to peel an apple.
You must go.
What are you reading?
There was absolutely nothing you could do about it.
Sugar is bad for your teeth.
Now go have fun.
Japan is a leader in the world's high-tech industry.
Please don't compare me with my brother.
We're getting nowhere.
On his shirt there was a sauce stain.
Animals cannot exist without air and water.
They went to the hospital.
The duke holds a lot of land.
I improvised.
I know Tom is colorblind.
These are inexcusable mistakes.
Do you give to charity?
I wonder if exchange students can join this club.
We have way too much work to do.
He never fails to give her a birthday present.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Please take off your hat.
Give me something to eat.
If you don't do this now, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
They were satisfied with the result.
I am in your debt.
Everyone's in position.
Disconnect the power cable from the modem, wait for approximately one minute, then reconnect the cable.
This house has eleven rooms.
A good teacher must be patient with his pupils.
This chair is very comfortable, but I don't like the color.
I have a husband.
Are you going to save us?
I'm alive and well.
I think Tom did that intentionally.
I've got to speak to you.
Cats can see in the dark.
Tom can't climb down from the tree.
My mother told me to mow the lawn.
Is there a clothing store near here?
He likes taking a walk by himself.
There were few, if any, trees.
I promise I'll try.
We're getting out of here.
I saw a whale tail today.
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
I wonder why women don't go bald.
How soon can you get to my house?
The blood test is normal.
Do you know what Tom does in his free time?
We want one.
I got sucked in on a lot of phony deals.
The dog is dead.
I would like to tell you something.
Where are you bound?
They bought a box of cookies.
Make sure that the dog does not escape.
We made sure of it.
He is a teacher and novelist.
Tom persuaded Mary to lend him her new car.
I met him at the end of the platform.
I've heard quite a lot about you.
I want to dream.
What seems simple to you seems complex to me.
He disguised himself as a woman.
I didn't know that you needed to do that.
The new server should have much better performance.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
She put the children to bed.
I want you to get a good night's rest.
Hurry up, or you will be late for school.
I'm not rich, nor do I wish to be.
I was somewhere else.
His way of speaking offended me.
Let me explain how this works.
I'm feeling low.
Everything is over.
How long have you been in Australia?
You are always as busy as a bee.
What a pleasure!
He did well in all subjects and, above all, in mathematics.
I can't believe I listened to you.
Get on your feet.
They'll have to wait.
You always lie to me.
Do you still want me to teach you French?
The strange object in the sky could be seen with the unaided eye.
They are both colleagues of mine.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
The lights are all off.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
Kiss me.
Do you travel often?
He has an uncontrollable temper.
Make a guess.
Can I see you a second?
Smoking is harmful to the health.
I study French in addition to English.
Not all children like apples.
I don't see how that is any of your business.
The party is over.
Do you have a mobile phone?
There is almost no furniture.
Do you really believe I killed my brother?
Tom isn't as tall as I am.
I'm not feeling too well.
We're going north.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Did you call the police?
My mother grows flowers in her garden.
Tom needs help now.
I couldn't do that either.
You're a failure.
It's no good.
I might vote for you.
Tom is a professional baseball player.
I will always be with you.
You're charming.
He had already gone.
I'm beginning to think you're serious.
Could you give me some examples?
It's been raining since morning.
I'm not going to lose.
I have something to ask of you.
My brother is at his desk.
She takes after her mother in every respect.
He lived a happy life.
I hope you learned your lesson.
They ruined my life.
He asked her some questions.
I guess I'd better start packing.
I expected you home an hour ago.
Just do everything Tom tells you to do.
There isn't any more time.
This room is not very large.
I guess you think you're pretty special, don't you?
It'll snow tomorrow.
There is a man waiting for you at the door.
I figured I might be able to help.
Tom is not interested in politics.
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
Do you have any idea when those pictures might have been taken?
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
You can't just keep throwing your money away on this kind of thing.
I know the whole of the story.
Tom has spent time in prison.
We are in favor of your plan.
I remembered everybody.
He left Japan for good.
I'll call you later.
I don't like summer.
Tom took a quick shower.
He fell asleep during class.
He spoke too quickly for the students.
I want a pair of gloves.
Let the weekend begin.
He often drives to the library.
Hi.
A rose's petals are very delicate.
If you were my wife, I'd hang myself.
I don't think it would work as well as you might expect.
Tom seemed very excited.
I haven't eaten lunch yet.
How much are we short?
She promised not to tell anyone.
I just want to go back to bed.
I was astonished.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
I want to help you, Tom.
I will need your help.
She traveled around Japan.
Try on this new suit to see if it fits well.
We weren't lucky.
I'm way stronger than I used to be.
I'm lucky.
Do you shower every day?
We turned the offer down.
I think you deserve this.
The room was quiet.
He gave me this book.
She attended the meeting.
Have you ever seen her?
He never got a holiday.
Blow out all the candles on the birthday cake at once.
She watched him continue to fight as hard as he could.
Guess what I'm holding in my hand.
Looks like we barked up the wrong tree.
The sky became darker and darker.
This decision is final.
I was so happy.
Are you guys all right?
Your breakfast is ready. Don't let it get cold.
He took me for my twin brother.
He boarded the ship.
He's right behind you.
Don't breathe a word of what I've told you to anyone.
I'm back.
You are suitable for the job.
You love your work, don't you?
Snow completely covered the town.
This isn't what it looks like.
You seem to have the wrong number.
Did you write your name?
You've always been so good to me.
This is going to get messy.
Look at the size of that thing!
Is it your first day at school?
He said his father was ill, but that was a lie.
Her mother is a good pianist.
I am a cook.
That's 20% of the world's population.
You should have told me a long time ago.
Do you think in French?
You can't let it get to you.
I don't like that.
Could you bring me a pillow and blanket, please?
The President desires peace, doesn't he?
Do you want us to take you home with us?
I don't want to hear about all your ex-boyfriends.
That's not nice.
He was stoned.
Why would I be nervous?
Don't bother to answer this letter.
Where's the honey?
Fill in your name and address here.
I'll text you the address.
Could you just please answer the question? We don't have all day.
In Japan people come of age when they are 20 years old.
I don't like her face.
What exactly do you want me to do?
I don't mind helping you clean up after the party.
You're kind of cute.
They work at night.
The class went wild.
I may actually have to go.
I want to learn to sing like you.
It's about time you stopped watching television.
Mary opened her purse and looked around in it.
Are you as tall as me?
Being ill, I stayed at home all day long.
Tom wanted to die.
Dogs wag their tails and cats swish theirs.
He fell in love with his best friend.
I love reading in bed.
Watch the road.
He gave an explanation about why he had been absent.
I built a house within a stone's throw of the forest.
They're out to get you.
The cabinet minister ended up submitting his resignation.
The bakery is located next to the butcher shop.
I keep saying that I'm innocent, but no one will listen.
She gave a poor explanation for being late.
I didn't even notice what Tom was wearing.
I've come to ask you a favor.
I can do it without her help.
She advised him to work harder.
Since there were no customers, we closed the shop early.
The sky is clear and the sun is bright.
I've lived here for three years.
I left it on the table.
It's the third of October.
They left it under the table.
She's a tough woman.
You can count on me any time.
Fashion is not my specialty.
Shouldn't you be cleaning the attic?
Put it down.
I listened to her story.
May I say something?
I don't want you to dance with Tom anymore.
He didn't tell me everything.
His wife comes from California.
How did you know all that?
Where have you been all afternoon?
The twins are as alike as two peas in a pod.
We've decided to adopt your idea.
Letters are delivered every day.
Can you guess what I have?
You don't seem so smart.
Is there anything you need?
My father is a bit old-fashioned.
The sun gives light and heat.
Can't we have a snack or something?
Pour me a drink.
I'm conservative.
I want to talk to her.
You'll be hearing from us soon.
The more stubborn you are, the more isolated you become.
Tom abandoned that idea.
I'm not hungry at the moment.
I'm waiting for a telephone call.
I was absolutely right.
You're taller than me.
I'd like you to have dinner with me.
I have a book to finish.
How did you get into Harvard?
I'm free on Sunday.
Tennis is my preferred sport.
Some people think the president spends too much time traveling.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
He has been waiting for an hour.
Why are you always so happy?
Seeing the woman with the yellow hat reminded me of a story.
It was a hot debate.
Do you know any Greek myths?
We're all having lunch.
Why don't you trust me?
Everyone loves him.
We need to find Tom right away.
How long will it take us to get to Boston?
He is walking now.
I hate it.
When will you go?
What just happened?
We must be cautious.
I expect he'll pass the examination.
I had no intention of going there by myself.
The thief escaped through the window.
Tom told me he was working.
They all drank.
They're back.
Anybody can make a mistake.
We didn't tell you that.
Those three are his daughters.
Do you love your mother?
Tom knows the city very well.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom seems to be aware of what's happening.
This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
I missed the train by two minutes.
I had never seen my father cry before that time.

My primary concern is your safety.
You're all against me.
She told him that she was sad.
He thought of a good idea.
You look good in black.
Tom doesn't know anything.
Would you like to come over for dinner?
I often stay up all night.
There are plenty of oranges on the tree.
Will you please go there?
It's after midnight.
I know you've been busy.
These clothes are not appropriate for a cold winter day.
I'm here to ask for your help.
I don't think I can answer that.
What time is your curfew?
I'd like to talk with you in private.
I'll read anything.
Do a lot of people live in your town?
I think you should stay where you are.
I've been trying to get your attention.
I don't care what he does.
My wife is a poor driver.
Tom will be there tonight.
They invited me to play cards.
Is all of that necessary?
You should ask Tom for advice.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
Do you feel lucky?
A light lunch will be served.
We've already done that several times.
She hardly ate anything.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
You may use my car.
You've turned up at the right moment.
I don't want to be in pain.
Let me carry it for you.
That's my problem, not yours.
I've been on the phone all afternoon.
It's very clean.
I'd like to go abroad someday.
Tom was arrested Monday night.
The contract is in the bag, so let's go out and celebrate.
I left my umbrella at home.
I figured it out by myself.
Could you lend me a hand?
Give me the car keys.
I have a date tomorrow night.
I don't know which of you came first.
I don't know how long.
Did she look in her bag?
I'm not married.
You can swim, can't you?
We have to call Tom.
I've worked all my life.
Tom bought a gift for his daughter.
Lend me your dictionary, please.
Did you open all the boxes?
He is by far the best student.
Can you handle it?
He dedicates himself to research.
This car comes with an air conditioner.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
Tom says you're a genius.
You're a star.
I wonder why Tom told Mary that.
I don't like either of the pictures.
Is college worth it?
I had a weird dream.
She kissed him on the cheek.
I will not let you pass.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom is fighting cancer.
He wants to be more independent.
That's how it was.
Who are these presents for?
Is there something else you want to tell me?
You need to be more patient.
I did it against my will.
This is too hard.
Tom went outside to smoke a cigarette.
It's very good.
Are you all finished here?
She betrayed you.
I was just looking around.
Tell them that they're wrong.
He saved my life.
He went to America to study English.
I'm from the city.
I feel like I've been cheated.
Tom hated his mother.
Music is the universal language.
She ignored him all day.
Do you deny it?
The frost killed all the flowers.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
She gave him a piece of paper.
Let's go dancing.
What are you going to do during the summer holidays?
This train will get you there in half the time.
You should visit Kyoto, which is famous for its old temples and shrines.
She is getting better day by day.
Cats have nine lives.
I think you should answer the question.
What do you suppose is in this box?
Tom thanked the chef.
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
My sister often cries.
I have very sensitive skin.
How do you know for sure?
He asked us not to make any noise.
It's not a secret that Tom's opinion is different than yours.
You were such a big help yesterday.
Where are you going with this?
My husband is in jail.
I had to get away from here.
How could you not notice?
I admit I was surprised.
Tom said that he was very sad.
His name is known to everyone in the town.
I saw them.
How can I protect myself?
Is it raining right now?
The suspect was innocent of the crime.
I don't usually eat breakfast because I'd rather sleep as late as I can.
You're the best man for the job.
My opinion was irrelevant.
We played a lot of games at the party.
The time has come for you to play your trump card.
Anything you say may be used against you.
Put your books away.
Tom appeared to be in his early thirties.
You've told me that already.
Whose paper is this?
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be singled out for a full body search.
Did you buy these for me?
He made up the whole story.
I want to be a lumberjack.
I will come on Wednesday evening unless I hear from you to the contrary.
I really need it.
You may stay here with me.
You've made your point.
He could swim across the river when he was in his teens.
I'm really tired and want to go to bed early.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
I felt bad about what I did.
Could you give me your name and phone number?
That was the best meal I've ever eaten.
What's your son's name?
Do you think I'm too materialistic?
He was too drunk to drive home.
Let's check it out.
I work for a travel agency.
I suggested that the plan be postponed.
How can I help?
Mother divided the cake into three parts.
Let me reiterate what I've said.
Is it to go?
I must learn this poem by heart.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I've decided to buy the blue car.
I don't quite know what to say.
I have to go upstairs.
I made fun of him.
I found your diary.
Tom and Mary have decided to eat together.
I'm beginning to see a pattern.
Tom works.
Something's on your mind, isn't it?
I forgot to call him today.
Tom hasn't eaten anything yet.
They're not a threat.
Are there many flowers in the garden?
Tom needs help now.
Have you seen my keys?
He can't take care of himself.
The programmer is fixing a technical problem with the computer server.
Do you know Tom's real name?
It's too narrow.
Before I get out of bed, I spend a little time thinking about what I'll be doing the rest of the day.
She's dependent on her husband.
Rabbits have long ears and short tails.
She agreed with him that I should go to the meeting.
I'd very much like to go.
We still need your help.
Everybody agrees with you.
Kublai Khan is the grandson of Genghis Khan.
Happy is a man who is contented.
Put the scalpel down.
If I were you, I'd study harder.
A good many people were there.
We're all in agreement.
What did you do with the camera?
It was a judgment call.
Tom is slowing down.
This is my decision.
I can't excuse her.
She cooks for him.
Forget your sorrows.
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
Many pretty flowers bloom in the spring.
Don't eat garbage.
Do you remember anything from back then?
I said to myself, "That's a good idea."
I need to see you in my office.
Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
That's OK.
The thief was apprehended this morning.
Tom is the boy I told you about the other day.
Have you ever loved a man?
I quit smoking and drinking.
Don't send me home, please.
Stop being cruel.
The boy told me why he was crying.
She isn't old enough to get a driver's license.
I understood.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
I don't want to go to work.
It was a good movie.
No more can be said.
Did you wash that?
That's doubtful.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
Many people prefer to cook with butter instead of oil.
I was unable to stand any longer.
How many of you live here?
I am pretty sure.
I went to school.
I grew up in this house.
She has faults, too.
He was elected mayor.
Tom is kidding.
The sooner you start, the sooner you'll finish.
Are you up?
Don't threaten me.
This is my first day.
This is a serious case of negligence.
We're leaving Australia next month.
I'm a bookkeeper.
I'll call you at seven.
Do you like her songs?
I've been all over the world.
That's how it should be.
I paid for them.
Have you ever been betrayed by a good friend?
She can run a full marathon.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
The rumor turned out to be false.
I thought the game was over.
I figured something was up.
Why don't you leave me alone?
You'd make a good private detective.
I'm not totally stupid.
This isn't funny.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
What's your speciality?
The gate needs to be closed.
I didn't realize you could speak French.
Was that all you wanted to say to me?
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
A dish can be spicy without being hot.
We had a secret meeting.
His work is not up to standard.
I could use some sleep.
Don't throw away this newspaper. I haven't read it yet.
She did nothing but cry all the while.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
I have lucid dreams.
You're talkative.
I don't want to wake my neighbors.
His house is somewhere about here.
I'm delighted to hear that.
They are not very different from anybody else.
I thought you'd be alone.
Who painted this picture?
It's boring to wait for a train.
Don't act like you don't know how to dance.
I have some extra tickets for the concert.
No one can help me.
We agreed among ourselves.
Tom doesn't talk to Mary anymore.
Mary is one of the richest women in the world.
I certainly have had great luck.
I'm worried about them.
You're not allowed to park here.
My father runs a restaurant.
We're confused.
I see no reason to tell you anything.
It's too late.
He wrote to me from time to time.
I find it hard to get up early on cold mornings.
My father isn't home.
I wish I were as rich as Tom is.
Is Tom safe?
We're prepared to make tough choices.
He was a rugby player.
These hats are the same size.
Tom's family is in Boston.
Who can you trust?
Don't count on them.
Let's enjoy the long vacation.
The ship wasn't ready for battle.
I think that went well.
Is this radio yours?
Let me tell you about the origin of this school.
I got you all right where I want you.
We want to break off this negotiation.
I'm bringing wine.
I've been gone for a long time.
I was told to contact you.
I've got something better in mind.
I'm convinced that you're right.
Tom opened a window.
What do you think of this plan?
I don't want them to go away.
At least they listened to me.
Why don't you just ask your parents for money?
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
You have only to ask for his help.
Upon seeing what was happening, we decided to leave.
I never should've mentioned it.
I was pleasantly surprised.
He went into teaching.
Everyone smiled but Tom.
Let's see if we can solve that mystery.
The bookstore is open.
Are you going, too?
Noise is the most serious problem for those who live around the airports.
They were dead.
I asked Tom why he had never studied French.
That's not a bad thing.
Are you American?
I cannot find time to read the book.
I'm confident that you'll succeed.
I just don't understand what goes through the minds of people who troll forums.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
Tom has a terrible secret.
We found all the boxes empty.
During hot weather, be sure to drink lots of water.
You're no different.
Don't ever make me wait again.
He is wearing glasses.
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
You're bright.
Don't resist us.
I felt sad.
Is Gibraltar a country?
What is the second largest country in the world?
Tom heard someone humming his favorite tune.
I turned it off.
How much is this handkerchief? "It is ninety-five cents."
Are you just going to stand there all day?
Tom slept on the train.
I've never even told my wife.
Tom hasn't eaten a decent meal in a long time.
We need proof.
The next morning, the snowman had completely melted.
You think I don't know what's going on?
She lives on a small pension.
I had a healthy breakfast.
All the boys ran away.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
I'm not in the mood to do that now.
I liked that wine.
How do you know I'm not from here?
She hugged him.
I slept very well.
This video is boring.
We want revenge.
Tom didn't think he'd ever get used to Thai food.
A lot of books are published every year.
That was uncalled for.
As soon as he returns, I will tell you.
Everything we've told you is true.
You do not want to incur the wrath of God.
I like raspberries.
I'm happy you're here.
What I'm telling you is true.
It looked funny.
I didn't get discouraged.
She asked me if I knew how to sew.
Don't get any ideas.
Did you see Tom at school today?
He never takes me out for dinner.
What do you want me to do about it?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
Let's drop it.
Don't be crude.
After a couple of drinks, the guy was feeling no pain.
You can't say no.
I hate dancing.
I hear some screaming.
This animal is friendly.
The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
You don't have to buy water, do you?
Tom isn't a good swimmer.
I hate that you have to leave.
I'll call back a bit later.
I'm working.
He got kicked off the team.
What are you staring at?
We were so tired that we turned in about 9:00 last night.
What do they want to talk about?
Tom never comes.
The weather is beautiful today.
None of my classmates live near here.
She picked me an apple.
Why are we still talking about this?
I want to speak to a lawyer.
There's a gas leak.
They greeted each other warmly.
Are you sure about this?
He helped me do my homework.
We danced until midnight.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I ran into an old friend of mine this morning.
How many people were at your party?
Tom died when he was 97.
There's something I have to ask you.
It was wise of you to accept his offer.
Never mind what happened.
He is no ordinary man.
Who's next on the list?
We walked to the river.
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.
I don't work on Mondays.
He has done it in just a few years.
He had no distinguishing features.
Tom knew that Mary loved him.
Tom fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth.
It was no trouble.
I am too tired to climb.
I'm disappointed in you.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
I knew we would find it.
Does this backpack belong to him?
I have little money now.
I want a new knife.
Can I see that again?
That's what makes me nervous.
I still have to try.
The hedgehog is a small animal.
Please give me the letter.
That only makes it worse.
I believe in you.
We may have missed the bus.
None of us can speak French.
Do you know how to read and write?
Is your house big?
These glasses do not fit me well. They are too large.
That boy is smart.
We wish him all success in his future endeavor.
Tom corrected himself.
The experiment has to begin.
Why don't I have a girlfriend?
Even a child knows that.
I know what time you said to be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time.
I don't think I can keep that promise.
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
The boys played in the mud.
Where is your homework?
He must not live.
What's the biggest difference?
You can't prove a thing.
I've been living in Boston for three years.
Which do you like better, spring or autumn?
Tom is a thirty-year-old carpenter.
How did you get here?
She made up her mind to go to college.
Our train arrived on time.
Have you brought your ID card with you?
I caught the last bus.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
Tom is a true professional.
The teacher told him not to forget his books.
Please wait half an hour.
Let's begin at the beginning.
I got sleepy.
The file cabinet drawers are open.
This app automatically signs you in when you open it.
The heat kept me awake all night.
I have a Canadian girlfriend.
She is a poor cook.
We walked around the pond.
I ought to have told her the truth.
When do you want to start?
It must've rained hard during the night.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
He acquired education late in his life.
He always studies hard.
I don't want to live my life in fear.
You dropped something.
Attendance is mandatory.
You don't give orders here.
I'm considering going with them.
Is that bothering you?
This is complicated.
Everyone was silent as the teacher was announcing the results of the examination.
A fire broke out in my neighborhood last night.
He regularly trains with bodybuilding equipment.
They can't hurt you now.
Tom needs to do that now.
Tell us what you want to do.
It was not conclusive.
You're smarter than me.
They have been busy.
Are you going to break up with me if I get fat again?
If I were you, I would trust her.
The boat capsized.
The higher we go up, the thinner the air becomes.
I have lots of friends.
I expected him to come.
I lost a lot of blood.
Tom is not religious.
Tom watches TV all the time.
Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
Where there's smoke there's fire.
Scott was a contemporary of Byron.
You're not fired.
Please don't forget the receipt.
At the start, I was really still a bit scared.
My uncle has a deep interest in art.
I didn't notice him go out.
She is still a girl.
We still can't see it.
How do you like this town?
I am going out this afternoon.
How many men do you have?
I love traveling in the winter.
No one else laughed.
I guess we're not invited.
You have my word.
I need 30 minutes.
Being with you makes me feel happy.
She cannot have broken her promise.
It was fun while it lasted.
She was lying.
He is the image of his father.
I accept your apology.
I still have the key to Tom's house.
I need to call the embassy.
You're very clever.
Do you remember the day this picture was taken?
It works like magic.
How much is your hourly pay?
Nothing like that will happen again.
Did you see anything you like?
I've been asked to help Tom.
I'm not an idiot.
Our teacher said that water boils at 100ºC.
Stockholm is the capital of Sweden.
I knew we'd win.
I am afraid that you will get lost.
Don't thank me now.
She pulled down the blinds.
We spoke to each other in French.
It was a great privilege working with you.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't speak French.
Don't stay in the sun too long.
Do you have any imported beer?
The bill, please.
Can we fix this?
Show me how to do it, please.
You didn't prepare me for this.
He is reading a book.
What a weakling!
I like that kind of work.
Tom can't rely on Mary's help.
I'm trying to save room for dessert.
I don't have time to help you now.
I've never told anyone.
Do you expect me to believe you?
I want to take advantage of it.
I'm in the house.
Watch out for rowdy or drunk customers.
Tom won't retire.
That house is big.
Have you written in your diary today?
The seats are all sold out.
The wind was howling.
You're disgusting.
We're a bit busy at the moment. Can you hang on a minute?
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
How do you want them?
I mistook you for your brother.
I will play the guitar for you.
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
Hello. Is this the Gotos' residence?
Tom hopes Mary will win.
The more foolish a child is, the cuter he seems to his parents.
I have very few books in English.
I did that late last night.
Aren't you sick of eating fast food?
Why don't you pull over?
I think it's better for us to adopt his plan.
Do you drink wine?
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
His grandfather died of cancer last year.
He is washing the car.
That isn't what I'm looking for.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
I'm thinking of going somewhere for a change of air, since my doctor advises me to.
There are cases where honesty doesn't pay.
I know the truth.
I don't think it would work as well as you might expect.
What hotel will you be staying at?
What makes you happy?
He got more than he bargained for.
Tom and Mary were worried.
We have little chance of winning.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
My parents want me to come home.
We were both drunk.
What did you want to talk to me about?
That's all over now.
Europe has a smaller population than Asia.
Her unhappiness turned to bliss when she heard his voice.
I just want tonight to be special.
I was looking for something.
Everybody here knows me.
That's my suitcase.
What do you think I should write?
Tom must be proud of you.
My parents had an arranged marriage.
Watch out for that man.
His house is within a stone's throw of his school.
You are big.
Help me to load the truck.
I don't think we need to do it.
This bus will take you to the station.
Tom wondered when the meeting would start.
You can use mine.
A dog has four legs.
You need a drink.
Don't go near the dog.
I feel safer here.
I want to introduce you to some people.
Tom won't remember a thing.
I couldn't breathe.
That's a really good hospital.
We are next-door neighbors.
I thought it was a fluke.
You're very funny.
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
The cat ate the mouse.
It is time you told her the truth.
I feel terrible about the way things happened.
He took off his glasses.
Don't move until I tell you to.
I don't like your friends.
He offered more than could be expected.
This is the best Christmas I've had in years.
Tom and I are neighbors.
Tom isn't used to city life.
They fought until the end.
How would you like us to proceed?
I brought you another blanket.
Let's not let our imaginations run wild.
Have you ever been on TV?
They clung together for warmth.
Tom has been talking on the phone for an hour.
The law is full of ambiguities.
You look like you're busy.
I can hardly wait to get started.
Are you kids hungry?
It was getting dark.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
That was you, wasn't it?
Do you like to dance?
Do I need to pay in advance?
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom left thirty minutes ago.
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
Tom, it's not your fault.
No one uses that word anymore.
The store was so crowded that they lost sight of each other.
It helps.
They revolted against the government.
You're not in a hurry, are you?
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
I was busy cooking.
I've never noticed that.
My father is going to go abroad next week.
Should I wash the lettuce?
Tom took a week off.
Have you finished your homework?
Do you sell any guidebooks written in French?
I hate soccer.
I'm not good at public speaking.
I'll take back everything I said.
I'll handle that later.
I like the way you think.
I don't have time for that.
Tom had no reason to do that.
It never occurred to me that he loved me.
Am I wrong?
What was your favorite book when you were a child?
Please follow the school rules.
Keep in touch!
Show me what you bought.
If you're not happy, quit.
How many different pieces are there in Japanese chess?
He went far away.
Anybody home?
I still enjoy that.
She has been sick since last Wednesday.
Are you old enough to vote?
They won us over with their small-town hospitality.
I would never make fun of you.
He's not my type.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
Do you think you could help me do that?
After being in a coma for three weeks, Tom regained consciousness.
Send the kids to bed.
It's close to my house.
Someone grabbed me from behind.
I can't help making fun of him.
What will happen to her?
My mom doesn't want me to play with you.
You're too naive.
Tom could see that Mary was crying.
I believe you.
Tom won $10,000 in the lottery.
I hurried in order to catch the first train.
You are a doctor.
I'm going to fight.
I just feel so lost.
It's a routine procedure.
What are you doing now?
It seems like an interesting job. What do you exactly do?
The truth is I told a lie.
This proverb is worth remembering.
Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to watch her son growing up.
We will be able to raise cows and sheep, too.
We're tempting fate.
I don't understand what the problem is.
Did you get enough sleep?
Tom buttoned his coat.
It was an act of courage.
I just love beautiful women.
How do you know all these things?
You ran a red light.
We're powerless.
I'm used to it.
What did you get hit with?
When will you ever learn?
I have no books to read.
You can rest.
This is Carrie Underwood's latest album.
I just don't want to have people thinking I'm weak.
This plan had little chance of success.
I can't believe you did this by yourself.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
I don't want to live in a big city.
At last, it began to rain.
I think that's where Tom is.
Can I use your phone for a sec?
The plane increased speed.
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.
I have so much to show you.
You'll do exactly as I say.
Are you going to help me?
Please give my regards to your parents.
In most cases, his answers are right.
I didn't expect that to come from you.
He couldn't hold back his tears.
He was humiliated by her.
I love hanging out with you.
The damage was done.
I'm aware of that possibility.
Please answer all the questions.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
He's already left.
I'll never do this again.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
What keeps you going?
Let me introduce my mother to you.
The doctors did everything they could to save Tom.
How're you doing at home?
Tom certainly doesn't speak for all of us.
Mary is charming.
This airport is easily accessible by bus.
I know Tom is a little late.
Can I have this orange?
We had to alter our plans because we didn't have enough money.
What more do you want?
Does your mother clean your room for you?
My uncle gave him a present.
I don't see eye to eye with my father.
Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times.
I don't need to be lectured by you.
They made fun of my clothes.
I want to eat something good.
Tom didn't have dinner last night.
This watch is made in Japan.
You can't just walk in here and start dictating policy.
Tom saw Mary leave.
Harvard was founded in 1636.
Tom was obviously troubled.
That's my beer.
You hurt me.
He refused to shake hands.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
They shared the money.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
Blue isn't my favorite color.
I just followed the recipe.
You know I hate that.
Hold on. Just let me collect my thoughts.
Could you please tell me the truth?
Everybody knows we hate Tom.
Can you walk on stilts?
It will not make much difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
She told him her age.
Help me if you can.
I wanted to sell Tom my old car.
I have no reason to lie to you.

A dog was following Tom.
Our children still go to school.
We depend on each other.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
I must get going.
Watch the front.
Which dictionary did you refer to?
Have you met her?
Churches were erected all over the island.
Most young people have a mobile phone.
We are in a library.
He has a very interesting book.
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
I have something of yours.
Birds evolved from dinosaurs.
They're about to leave.
You have to go.
I am very tall.
I wasn't interested in the job.
One is red and the other is white.
The house collapsed a week later.
I stopped off at Osaka on my way to Tokyo.
They defused the bomb before it could blow up.
I was able to get my parents to consent to my marriage.
She was asked to the party.
We enjoy reading books.
Why did your T-shirt shrink?
Come here and help me.
Tom has caused me a lot of trouble.
I've come here to help you.
She assumed an air of indifference.
You need to lose some weight.
They live apart.
You're free.
I watched a movie on video.
I worry about my future.
Tom and Mary never listen to me.
That looks like it hurts.
I understand completely.
I just want things to be normal.
I went to the shop.
The new model will be priced at $12,000.
Hey everyone, please listen.
Give it to whoever wants it.
I need to jump start my car.
Have you ever done any volunteer work?
We're nearly finished.
Don't tell me you stole it.
You must get up a little earlier.
How many boys are there in this class?
You'll be crying before long.
I'm going for a run. Do you want to come?
Will it rain this afternoon?
He could not perceive any difference between the twins.
Tom doesn't know how to milk a cow.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
Beat the eggs.
I don't know anybody here in this town.
I'm sorry for calling so late. I just wanted to hear your voice.
This feels weird.
I have to do it myself.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
I don't need you to take care of me.
How have you been getting along lately?
Do you wear glasses?
You really are in trouble, aren't you?
He demanded that his salary be increased.
I went to Harvard.
I feel wonderful.
Let's get out of here before the cops get here.
Whenever my uncle comes, he brings some nice things for us.
Is it yours?
All the eggs went bad.
Both my sisters are teachers.
I forgot to tell you where I put your jacket.
Everybody's home.
Go a little faster, please.
Today I have a good appetite.
I don't sleep a lot.
I assume you've heard from Tom.
I didn't look.
He is likely to arrive soon.
Put away your wallet.
What should I do with that?
Please show me your notebook.
You've got to be bold!
This is awesome.
We can't tell anyone about this.
Do we have any French homework that needs to be turned in tomorrow?
My grandmother can't see very well.
Are you tired?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
I can't answer the phone right now.
I may outlive you.
Why are you so quiet?
Who was the girl you were with the other day?
I've been writing a lot.
Do what you want.
Youth is wasted on the young.
Please sing.
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
I'll see what else I can find to eat.
Do you have something to show me?
I choose to believe you.
I didn't talk to anybody.
He is not always late.
You're too polite.
It's not like it used to be.
Tom is doing a dangerous job.
Why don't you go talk to him?
I didn't think we would be so busy today.
She gave him a book.
What a nice family!
I advise you to stop smoking.
It's obvious you're wrong.
We cannot afford it.
They're brave.
Where do you want to go tomorrow?
I knew Tom was a bad driver.
That's none of your concern.
Tom wasn't worried about his grades.
That's going to take forever.
They were walking along the street arm in arm.
I had a drink or two before you came.
Answer my question carefully.
They're staring at you.
How did it get there?
The car has a new engine.
Call me when you can.
I don't think I can trust you anymore.
It would be best if you didn't do that.
What's the difference between asteroids and comets?
Tom knows a lot of stuff about Mary.
Tonight is the night.
My hobby is collecting insects.
I found the earring that you lost.
My sister often takes care of the baby.
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was younger.
You're not invincible.
Did I tell you that?
I guess I need a little sleep.
I like seafood.
I didn't win.
That's not really enough.
I know Tom is a bit crazy.
Tom claims he doesn't watch much TV, but he watches more than three hours every day.
You are curious, aren't you?
Here's the plan.
I enjoyed talking to him.
I didn't graduate.
Show me what to do.
Tom was never happy.
She is in a bad mood.
You must work hard if you want to succeed.
I think Tom would like that.
I cannot look at this picture without thinking of my dead mother.
You don't fool me, you know.
I remember reading about it.
I'm a little overweight.
Forget I said anything.
He invested a lot of money in stocks.
How often do you change your razor blade?
How many people were aboard that ship?
Everything's going to be all right.
You should think about your future.
I'd like to book a table for four for tomorrow night.
I hope we're going to do something worthwhile.
What sort of person are you?
She apologized to him for being late.
Do you have any idea what happened?
The rules were recently relaxed.
I like these hats.
He wrote her a long letter, which he didn't mail.
I know who my enemy is.
Please validate this ticket.
Please forgive me for forgetting to call you.
I really do miss my parents a lot.
You don't know that.
I don't think Tom is as fast as me.
Anybody could do this.
I must have my watch repaired.
Revolutions that don't succeed are soon forgotten.
I can't help feeling sorry for the girl.
He can't run his own family, let alone a nation!
The clock says two.
I can hear perfectly well.
I'll spread the word.
Tom felt his phone vibrate.
The men are eating lunch.
Tom expects me to be there.
I have no more money in my wallet.
Say which you would like.
Finally, I found the answer to your question.
I know you're nervous, but rest assured, you won't feel a thing.
Can I use your phone for a sec?
Would you happen to be married?
You haven't given me what I asked for.
Where is the market?
Tom kissed his cousin.
The air we breathe consists of oxygen and nitrogen.
What did you want to see me about?
We're counting on you to help.
This road map is very useful.
They just want someone to blame.
Have you measured it?
We didn't have many visitors this summer.
What's in this bag?
What did you turn up?
Which TV show do you like the most?
I ate quickly.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
He left without so much as saying goodbye.
You don't want this, do you?
You talk too fast.
When will your new novel be published?
What a country!
What are you reading?
I did something really stupid.
He begged her to forgive him.
Hay is for horses.
You learn quickly.
I'll cancel it.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
I did find something.
I'm surprised this machine still works.
I finally caught up with my friends.
Do you want to tell me what this is?
I'm sure you must have a lot of questions.
Don't tell me what's possible.
I'm the one who brought the subject up.
My teacher warned me not to do it again.
She should have bought a used car.
He was leaving then.
Did you get his letter?
The museum is worth a visit.
I'm going for a run. Do you want to come?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
It may seem odd.
Never hit a man who can fight back.
He stayed at his aunt's house.
He has already finished his homework.
I'm wearing my swimsuit under my clothes.
It is raining hard now.
I tend to catch colds.
I put on a little weight last year.
I think Tom is amusing.
I didn't say that.
I didn't think you needed one.
She is in low spirits today.
It's yours.
What are you holding?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
You'll have a rough time.
You're so bossy.
Are you surprised?
It would be counter-productive to do such a thing.
We washed our feet.
Tom met Mary on his way to school.
I owe what I am today to my parents.
I thought you'd be taller.
People who are afraid of making mistakes will make no progress in English conversation.
You're very emotional.
I spent all my money on stupid stuff.
My mother happened to be there when the fire broke out.
I'm chubby.
You're a thief.
Her husband is about to die.
I finally have everything I need.
This will help keep you warm.
They have solved the problem once and for all.
I said I'm fine.
She didn't like living in the city.
You're wonderful.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
You didn't try hard enough.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
Mother advised me to take a walk for a change.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
The effects are reversible.
I was glad to help.
I'm trying to save you.
I can't help you do that.
Brush your teeth every day.
Tom believes that Mary is innocent.
Imagine if you started hiccoughing and you couldn't stop.
How big you are!
This beef is very nice and tender.
Your sacrifice was not in vain.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
A flu shot contains antibodies that fight the H1N1 virus.
We all need to work together.
You say you don't want to get your hands dirty.
They talked about culture.
You deserve the prize.
I fully understand your concerns.
We want it.
Where are we going?
She has been blind from birth.
How can we learn the truth?
Let me do the talking.
I don't believe in aliens.
Can you play the drums?
I lost the bet.
He remained silent the whole time.
I don't want to be seen in his company.
You knew this would happen, didn't you?
You can't go right now.
I barely had time to finish this report before the meeting.
No one knows.
I don't know what I'm going to tell Tom.
I came yesterday.
He overslept this morning.
Do you know how to play the piano?
Don't grow up to be like me.
You're very nice.
Was anybody else there?
Tom will believe you.
I want you to sing a song.
Tom looked at it more closely.
I want to be able to walk down this street without worrying about getting shot.
It's quiet.
No one else was injured.
Did anybody eat with you?
Life is unpredictable.
Were you fat when you were in high school?
I hear a woodpecker.
My wife is a vegetarian.
You should have worked harder.
I come from a long line of doctors.
We arrived tired and hungry.
I am yours and you are mine.
Many children learn to use a computer even before entering school.
She is wearing a hat.
They always make us do that.
How do you feel at this moment?
He came back not because he was homesick, but because he was running short of money.
Follow that car.
Is that right?
Be on time.
I thought the food was too greasy.
Go to the store.
You hurt Tom's feelings.
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
The principal of our school is an American.
Go away before they see you here.
This annoys me.
No one else knows how to do it.
My father suggested that we go camping.
I did it myself.
I liked your dancing.
I had to go back.
If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave.
I wonder what it feels like.
Never mind, I can do it by myself.
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?
Tom looks like a friendly guy.
Don't forget your things.
I will return your book on Tuesday if I have finished it.
What's it like in jail?
He exposed himself to danger.
No one will give me any money.
We're married to each other.
He's interested in Mayan prophecies.
He wants to talk to you.
I should go.
You're shy, aren't you?
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones.
I continued reading.
I will explain it to her.
I think you're nuts.
She offered her seat to an old woman.
Would you step aside?
The rooms in this hotel are pretty basic.
Could you read this for me?
She was never seen again after that.
Are they satisfied?
Do your parents know about this?
You two may leave.
Take the apple and divide it into halves.
Do you have a cellphone?
You seem depressed.
She wants to meet him again.
The weather is really bad.
It took me several hours to write it.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
He doesn't need to know.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
You may as well tell me all about it.
I asked him where he was going.
I got a lot of mail this morning.
They made fun of Mary.
He is photogenic.
Tom hates Mary.
I'm not naive.
Welcome.
This car cost me a fortune.
What did I tell you?
I'm sorry. I'll do anything to make this right.
He runs the business with his sons.
She goes to the movies once a week.
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
Everyone needs friends.
Her brother goes to school by bus.
Tom shut the door and locked it.
She advised him to cut down on smoking, but he didn't think that he could.
Which one is more expensive?
I have something in my suitcase for you.
I really want you to quit.
Who else is out there?
It was hard for me to sell my guitar, but I needed the money.
I'm not feeling quite up to par.
Frankly, I don't like your idea.
I saw a stranger enter that house.
Is that music I hear?
You're my only real friend.
I don't believe it.
All I want is for you to be happy.
What kind of stuff do you need?
You're really a good cook.
You're very sick.
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
What is your problem?
Tom makes his own bread.
Be nicer to your brother.
Mary asked Tom to shave off his beard.
He's very experienced.
Tom and Mary are both Canadians.
There are no more bullets.
I am seventeen years old, too.
Are all of these people your friends?
Don't give up on your dreams.
Do you know her?
We had to walk home in the rain.
I will always be there for you.
The regulation was abolished, but then it was reenacted.
She is not as patient as you.
Judging from the look of the sky, it will be fine tomorrow.
I called a cab, because it was raining.
She is the editor-in-chief.
Stop acting like a child.
To me, it is important.
The thief got away with the money.
She advised him to go there alone.
You've been kissed, haven't you?
Tom is getting some coffee.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom is my husband.
You're not going to do it, I hope.
I don't want to be rich.
He got hooked on drugs at a young age.
I won't be at the opening ceremony.
The U.S. thinks it is getting the short end of the stick.
I can't forget her.
Let's call for help.
Tom is a football player.
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
That was a big mistake, wasn't it?
Please help yourself to the cookies.
It's snowing.
I actually don't know.
Tom will probably never win.
Take care of yourself, OK?
They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
I can't wait to die.
It's still early. We should all just chill for a bit.
You're the scapegoat.
They won't help you.
What's your niece's name?
They don't have a shed.
Explain it to me.
Do you think I should go alone?
I hope that she listens to me.
They're just for you.
This is one of the best restaurants in town.
Hand me that broom.
The towel wasn't useful at all.
I'm going on a business trip.
These apples are rotten.
They condemned him for his cruelty to animals.
They're walking without shoes.
There's a rumor going around.
I know that Tom and Mary didn't sing together.
Please don't hang up.
There was a bridge across each river.
Tom was worried about that.
I have no idea how he escaped.
I've had this same hairstyle for years.
He has a heated swimming pool.
Have you ever been in prison?
The ship was searched thoroughly, but no illegal drugs were found.
You can't believe everything you hear.
I don't want you to be upset.
I know that Tom might do that.
I don't think it's safe to swim here.
He is unsatisfied with the result.
I'm too scared to say anything.
He may not be happy.
What did you do then?
In German, nouns are always capitalised.
Tom took care of our children last weekend.
My bicycle was gone when I returned.
Be sure to drop us a line as soon as you get to London.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
They accused the president of not caring about the common man.
She was leading her grandmother by the hand.
Things might get a little rough.
I had to call off the party.
Tom is at the shopping center.
These are the originals.
I can't stand being treated like a child.
I'll be seeing him tomorrow.
I'd like a cup of tea, please.
She was appointed chairperson.
This is getting complicated.
We can't choose who our parents are.
They're in the hot tub.
Will you check the tires?
You're not in a hurry, are you?
Have a nice weekend.
I hate being alone this time of year.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
I didn't take anything.
I spent all yesterday afternoon cleaning my room.
What did Tom tell Mary not to do?
He tried to commit a suicide.
Please sit here.
All are present.
The restaurant is empty.
Carry this for me.
We'll be at home all day today.
I would like to go to Japan.
Why didn't you wake me up?
From the top of that tall building, you can easily see the city.
Tom wants to call his uncle, but he can't seem to get a hold of him.
Please speak more slowly.
You really should enter the contest.
I'm fast.
He'll have to do this task again.
I can't speak to Tom.
Half of the apples that Tom gave me were rotten.
Children should obey authority.
Can you excuse me a second?
Start writing.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate that.
I understood what you meant.
It took a long time to analyze the data.
Who are you going to believe?
Tom didn't miss a thing.
How thoughtful of you to have chilled some wine for us.
I'm divorced.
I felt lost without you.
I like your attitude.
The young man saved the girl from drowning.
It seems to be serious.
I'm right beside you.
I met him about noon.
How about going for a walk after lunch?
I wonder if there'll be more snow this year than last year.
I have a very pretty girlfriend.
I had a strange dream last night.
I won't let you die.
It makes me so happy.
It was a very exciting game.
The freight train was held up about half an hour because of a dense fog.
Tom teaches his friends French.
Take your hat off when you enter a house of worship.
I'll be glad to drink a glass of champagne.
She's upset right now.
Tom got in the car.
There is no table in the room.
I should've seen that coming.
I thought I was happy.
We're all going.
Please reconsider.
He fed his dog at the same time every day.
My dog goes everywhere with me.
Tom hasn't apologized.
She was working last night.
He stays a long time every time he comes.
They kept him waiting outside for a long time.
I hope Tom isn't mistaken.
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
I ran out of ink.
You speak French, right?
You're stuck.
I thought this was a hospital.
Is there a mailbox near here?
In spite of the heavy traffic, we arrived on time.
You'll be thirty years old next year.
Do you accept Visa?
Do you have any children?
You should apologize to her for having been rude to her.
I want to get this translated into French.
Have you tried using a dating website?
Get a doctor.
I think that my German is really bad.
I stood under a tree to avoid getting wet.
I didn't think anyone was home.
We'll survive.
It was a waste of time.
Keep the window closed.
Summer has ended.
Everyone but Tom looked happy.
Will you watch the Olympics?
I saw a cat running after the dog.
He sat next to her.
The only thing I want to do right now is sleep.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
Any other bright ideas?
She is usually at home on Sundays.
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
I don't love you anymore.
I'm glad you brought that up.
You should go home now.
Please call a taxi for me.
Did you wait for Tom?
What's the time now?
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
There's danger that the levee will break. We have to evacuate immediately.
All I want is some companionship.
Tom sat behind his desk.
I am accustomed to living alone.
He came here before noon.
She argued with him about money.
I don't know why I did it.
I understand your dilemma.
I'll spend Christmas with my family.
Didn't anyone tell you?
Make a prediction.
She fell in love with him.
How's everything going?
I was disappointed with your paper.
We have to ask everybody this.
I'm glad you brought that up.
As I entered the room, they applauded.
Tom refused to help Mary do her homework.
I lost my keys somewhere yesterday.
I really am interested.
I lost three kilograms.
Tom isn't as talkative as he used to be.
Her words were like those of an angel.
I don't know how you do that.
What did you answer?
I belong to the rugby football club.
Why didn't you do anything?
I know you think I'm stupid.
How can you justify your behavior?
Does that mean you'll stay?
Guess what I bought today.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to learn enough French in just three weeks.
It's terrible.
Why don't you give tennis a try?
He's a Republican fundraiser.
Tom says it's an emergency.
They knew how much danger they were in.
Would you mind coming with me?
It's kind of boring.
I've been misunderstood.
I can't control what happens.
I can see myself in the mirror.
I know none of them.
That's exactly what I meant.
No one could sleep that night.
I fed the horse.
He can hardly speak.
I know Tom is a brave man.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Are you pleased with your new house?
His sisters as well as he are now living in Kyoto.
Why is he doing this?
The children didn't seem to understand the instructions.
I have no explanation.
Why don't we talk for a while?
We are sorry we can't help you.
The attempt failed.
Are you all right?
Could this be the start of something big?
The tall guy smoking a cigar over there is a famous director.
I had no idea you felt that way.
I do not like both of them.
We cannot live without air and water.
I don't believe you just said that.
Tom died at 65.
I hope I never meet him again.
I thought you'd want to know.
I don't eat out very often.
They made me go there.
He seems to make nothing of it.
Children want to hear the same story over and over again.
I like to write poems.
It's too bad you can't stay a little longer.
How much should they get?
You taught us that.
I think they should put a heavy tax on imports.
I paid attention.
I don't want anything happening to you.
They want to know what's going on.
The soldiers narrowly escaped death.
How long have you been living on Park Street?
He likes to hunt.
I liked walking alone on the deserted beach in the evening.
A mouse went for a walk on the table.
Open your eyes.
What did it look like?
I wrote that book.
Your feet are swollen because your shoes are too small.
Please show me your injured arm.
You can take part in the meeting regardless of your age.
One box is still missing.
I'm on the wrong bus.
Everyone is gone now.
She sat next to me.
Look out the window.
I figured you wouldn't come.
I think Tom is going to win.
Next week a family will move in.
Bring a camera.
Sorry, we're full today.
It was a difficult year for us.
I lost an earring.
He wrapped his arms around her.
I'm glad someone agrees with me for once.
I was at work.
I'll be there in an hour.
I figured that you'd be impressed.
You're very tall.
Put it onto the table.
My father gave up smoking last year.
He did it just for fun.
Show it to her.
Is college worth it?
Mastering a foreign language is difficult.
I didn't know apple trees grow from seeds.
I like skipping rocks.
I need some sugar. Do you have any?
They're just rich kids.
We've done something similar to that in the past.
I don't have as much free time as you do.
I'm one of the thirty people who had to do that.
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
Your English is improving.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
Get your mother to do your homework!
I'm strong enough to do that now.
Your T-shirt's on backwards.
The visitor sat across from me.
Tom thought that you were drunk.
It's all there.
Tom sweated.
Read the instructions carefully.
How did he come here?
Can I ask why this is so important to you?
Do you think I did it?
You'd better take an umbrella with you.
Almost everyone arrived on time.
He is something of a celebrity.
I wonder where she lives.
He was trembling with rage.
I know what you're thinking.
How about running?
The conclusion is crystal clear.
Be nice to her.
I just met him.
I'm not tired yet.
That looks like fun.
Tom is trying to say something.
I feel the same way as you do.
It's inadequate.
I have no objection.
You're confused again, aren't you?
I'd like to be called Tom.
I want to go with you tonight.
He retorted that it was all my fault.
That's just fascinating.
This local newspaper is published once a week.
The drug problem is international.
We'll attack.
Are you sure that's necessary?
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
I'll meet you at the usual place.
The idea of surprising her suddenly crossed my mind.
Says who? "Says me."
He was not impressed.
You're a traitor.
You should try to see it.
I have to go upstairs.
Life's experiences make vivid records on the sensitive plate of his mind.
I think that he is right.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
He has been busy since this morning.
You're back again.
The engineer climbed the telephone pole.
I'm safe.
It's okay to take it easy sometimes.
Is there a letter for me?
It's not your style.
I fail to understand his true aim.
Do you mind if I go?
I took this picture a week ago.
Why did they hire you?
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
I feel sympathy for people with that disease.
Are you saying that's not true?
Although my car is very old, it still runs very well.
I guess this is goodbye.
I hear someone coming.
Urgent business kept me from coming sooner.
How long did you stay in Boston?
The smell of macaroni and cheese makes me nauseous.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Tom asked Mary if she would be willing to donate some money.
After spending three weeks looking for a job, he found a well-paid one.
You can't know that for sure.
This movie makes no sense.
What are you mad at me for?
Tom says that he plans to stay in Australia.
Tom is three years older than you.
His name is known all over the country.
You should have accepted his advice.
Driving too fast is dangerous.
I'm so embarrassed, I want to die.
You're part of the problem.
I work out to stay in shape.
His absence was due to the storm.
This is big news.
Fortune smiled on him.
You wanted this, didn't you?
My wife works part time.
Tom didn't seem very busy.
I agree with you that we should try again.
What do you like to eat?
I don't even vote.
He admitted his guilt.
Move out of the way.
The military engaged the enemy five kilometers south of the capital.
You said you didn't understand.
Would you like to see that again?
A toothache deprived me of sleep.
They look just like rats leaving a sinking ship.
Don't repeat that.
Do it again!
I'm sure we can manage that.
Do they have a computer?
The walls were painted light brown.
What train you are going to take?
The latest issue of the magazine will come out next Monday.
You want to go out for a drink?
How could you not see this coming?
She is very beautiful.
Is something wrong?
There is a problem.
I want to believe you.
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me.
Tom doesn't work as much as he used to.
Microsoft has a completely new operating system in the works.
We spent the whole evening talking to them.
You don't look very well. Are you sick?
What did I miss?
Tom would've made the same decision I'm making if he were in my shoes.
You're crafty.
The snow was several meters deep.
He is endowed with many talents.
She apologized for her delay.
Anyone can make a speech here on Sundays.
I know you're working part-time.
I've been way busier than expected.
I love life.
We're not alone.
I would hate to become just a housewife.
We were children at that time.
Is money important to you?
Do you know his father?
It's getting cooler day by day.
I like your hat.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
Tom is lying in bed with a cold.
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
Are you hurt?
I can't afford the time to travel.
My camera can shoot high-definition video.
I speak French.
His family emigrated to the United States.
Are we alone?
I put my clothes in the dryer.
She didn't want him to play poker.
I'm not asking for money.
I'll need this.
I am getting a cold.
He complained about the noise.
You know what you must do.
He often suffered from toothaches.
I was just going to write a letter.
We're very excited.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
She isn't running.
The lake is deepest at this point.
She went out.
Can I give you a hug?
I can handle this.
Do you think this jelly's firm enough to eat yet?
I'm buying candy and cookies.
Just tell me what happened.
Where did you go?
I swear I've never hurt Tom.
There is some wind.
I know what it's like to be poor.
Tom still isn't quite convinced.
I hope you're not alone.
She is a beginner.
I am convinced that things will change for the better.
I just got the news.
It wasn't all that funny.
I got really mad.
The protesters set many cars on fire.
It's really very bizarre.
I think Tom is drunk.
Tom will do the same thing.
He is my close friend.
Stop arguing.
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
They forgot to lock the door.
Please ask the secretary to stock the office supplies in the storage room.
The job earns him half a million yen every month.
I'm the same height as Tom is.
I'm not invincible.
You're the oldest.
He never told anyone.
I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.
Tom is watching.
He turned to his friend for help.
I'm going to the hospital.
It's difficult to learn a foreign language.
How many audiobooks do you have on your iPod?
He took charge of the expenses.
We all have flaws.
It doesn't hurt.
Look at the meter.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
She went to the museum by taxi.
That bridge is made of stone.
We'll begin rehearsals tomorrow.
We need supplies.
I think it's time for me to show you how to do that properly.
The people listened to the speaker attentively.
The roads were very muddy since it had rained during the night.
I don't know if I'm staying yet.
Maybe I drink too much.
He wants to save the planet.
Please don't ask.
I think that it's dangerous to go walking alone at night.
Tom asked Mary many questions that she couldn't answer.
This chair is plastic.
Wait for us in the lobby.
I want to know the reason.
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
I expect you to tell me the truth.
We need to win.
I'm really starting to hate this town.
I can't wait for you.
I watched a movie with my friend in my room.
Tom says he'll correct it.
What was the problem?
I saw him naked.
Can you show me where I am on this map?
I'm very worried about your health.
Mary came up to me when she saw me.
The leaves on trees have turned red.
Where's Boston?
I party too much.
I'm not your friend.
What is this for?
You're depressed, aren't you?
It's not too deep.
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
Be quiet and listen to me.
I feel kind of tired.
If you have pain in your chest, consult your doctor right away.
He stared at that detailed miniature model of a dinosaur.
It's very early.
Who wrote the book?
Tom didn't know their names.
The road is icy, so take care.
If my brother hadn't helped me, I would've drowned.
I don't think I said that.
He sells cars.
He's cleaning his rifle.
How do you know it's true?
What a strange guy!
I was so sure this was what I wanted.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
Tell Tom we're waiting for him.
What do I get out of it?
Both are alive.
I choose to believe you.
The clock struck ten.
Tom is sitting on his desk.
I can't stop thinking about that.
He is not ashamed of being poor.
That's it.
English is spoken almost everywhere.
I can give you some useful information.
Tom wanted it.
I don't have time to do the laundry.
It's the best hotel in this town.
Stop, or I'll shoot.
I've had a lot of calls today.
I was thinking about joining the army.
I respect my teacher very much.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
I must go to work.
You're nuts!
I don't understand this sentence.
I know everything that you've done.
They all cheered.
I figured you'd enjoy this movie.
He is a reporter for Time magazine.
Tom agrees.
Tom is unfaithful.
Save me some ice cream.
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom's a doctor.
I belong to the swimming club.
When do you mean to start?
I want a word with you.
Take a look at this report.
No one was there.
Can you at least be happy for me?
We are at war.
They love Tom.
He was robbed of his money on the street.
Would you please tell me the way?
One man's medicine is another man's poison.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
She is quite angry.
You must not shout at him.
The tickets sold out within a week.
You don't seem convinced.
I want an apology.
The water is icy.
We're pretty tight.
Tom looked at Mary and shrugged.
The cat lay hidden in the bushes.
I've been stuck here for three days.
He is the greatest scientist that the world has ever produced.
Stay out of the water.
I'm seeing them tonight.
Aren't you embarrassed?
I want to be someone you can turn to.
How's your new job?
A temporary government was established.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
I'm mad at you.
Why are you so insecure?
You don't have to sing.
It was after a meeting in America that he decided to write a book for non-scientists.
I heard the front doorbell ring.
I want to work in a hospital.
He dislikes me.
Tom will leave Boston tomorrow.
Tom was unsatisfied with the results.
My son can tell time.
There's a table.
Population growth has given rise to serious social problems.
You remind me of your mother.
My brother is big enough to travel alone.
She has been unhappy since her cat died.
My sister is engaged in social work.
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
This does not bode well.
Automobiles replaced carriages.
It's what you deserve.
Do you know why this date is important?
I know Tom is a hockey fan.
He tried to attract her attention.
Tom no longer goes out with Mary.
I know Tom will be supportive.
Can you still remember when we first met?
I thought we talked about this already.
I hear that Mary is very pretty.
We bought bread and milk.
What's the point in doing that?
Do you want me to help you?
I thought you knew.
Tom is very afraid of snakes.
You should put your ideas in writing.
You seem perfect for the job.
I'll do that tomorrow if possible.
I hope that Tom isn't sick.
After he came back from service in Afghanistan, Tom was plagued by flashbacks and nightmares.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
This is the house where I was born.
My sister works at the United States Embassy in London.
You should've done that.
That TV station broadcasts only movies.
You don't sound convinced.
I was born in Kyoto.
Open the bottle.
He will come soon.
It was his best time.
My sister married her high school classmate.
Let's sit down somewhere.
Is there anything you want that you don't have?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Many thanks.
I don't believe in fate.
It is true that he won first prize.
He has no remorse.
Tom told the police everything he knew.
He appeared from nowhere.
I think it's OK.
Don't lie to us.
Tom has just finished writing a letter to Mary.
He promised to pay us high wages.
I hope that you'll help me.
I'm an actress, not a model.
That was the basic idea.
He's not very good at it.
Bring it back when you're done.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
You should try doing that.
Don't wait up for me.
The shower is broken.
This stinks.
We can't do this again.
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm always hungry.
Where would you like to go?
Is it all right to eat out tonight?
I looked for the key.
We may need it soon.
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
That's upsetting.
I'm tough.
He is always complaining about his low salary.
She was stupid enough to believe him.
Does anybody have a match?
What does that word mean?
I thought they wouldn't come.
Any child could do that.
Tom agreed to be here at 2:30, but he's not here yet.
Tom's question was an accusation.
What's your favorite number?
The price of this camera is very high.
We've only got three minutes.
I know that I can do more.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Open the door.
No one loves you as much as I do.
I didn't know what time I was supposed to leave.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Nice to see you.
Could you please tell me again when the meeting is supposed to start?
I want to buy a shirt for my brother.
I sell shoes.
The monthly staff meeting is never held on Monday.
There is no hope.
Tom can sit next to me if he wants to.
I haven't seen you around before.
Tom is unable to cope with stress.
I want the truth from you.
I'm not convinced.
He hated lying.
Even monkeys fall from trees.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
He scraped the mud off his boots.
What was it that you did there?
Many leaders supported the compromise.
May I talk to you?
I bet stuff like this doesn't happen to Tom.
You're no different.
Did it snow yesterday?
The criminal left footprints.
What're you writing?
I'm surprised I don't have to do what you have to do.
Do you know why she's so angry?
A dog has four legs.
I really wish I knew why Tom didn't like me.
What's your date of birth?
The streets were empty.
How many of you are there?
His speech impressed us very much.
I guess that wouldn't mean much to you.
There was a traffic jam.
I saw what your dog did.
I was so excited that I could not fall asleep.
Somehow or other I found his house.
Where did you find the keys?
Are you unlucky?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Do you feel like resting?
I clicked the link, but nothing happened.
Is there anyone here?
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation?
They won't let this pass.
St. Valentine's Day falls on Sunday this year.
Tom is chopping wood.
You should think before you begin to speak.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
It's not an emergency.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I wrote a letter yesterday.
Did Tom confess to killing Mary?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
He was struck off the list.
You know I can't wait for you if you're late.
Tom has known Mary since third grade.
Who told you to bring me here?
Our garden was full of weeds.
I'm on the phone with Tom now.
This is going to be a challenge.
I went to wash my hands.
He didn't see a thing.
Unfortunately, Tom let the cat out of the bag.
I know just what you need.
The cat sat on the table.
Tom likes country.
I want to get married, just not to you.
I told Tom Mary was telling the truth.
Give us a chance.
You're very flexible.
We were late for school because it rained heavily.
What makes you think that'll work?
You could well be right.
I'm not as smart as you.
I followed the recipe.
How many women have you talked to since you got out of prison?
Let me pay for the dinner.
I want to hear you say it.
You must steer clear of that gang.
When's this supposed to happen?
This one is prettier.
He was looking into the possibility of buying a house.
I am eating lunch with my sister.
Do you know how to turn this device on?
I've always admired you a lot.
He was a real drunkard.
You can't blame this on me.
I prefer to go alone.
You must make an effort to get along with everyone.
I love the sound of her name.
Did you send them?
I thought we were on the same side.
I was astonished by his ignorance.
I should've warned you.
The teacher can see you.
I loved that book.
I need a helmet.
I couldn't breathe.
They are talking about what they will sing.
Give me a table for two near the window.
A forest fire broke out in this area.
I'm so cold.
I can't believe that's what's really troubling Tom.
It's really humid, isn't it?
Are you sure it was Tom?
He is a very imaginative writer.
New stamps will be issued next month.
I don't believe in coincidence.
Is that an original painting?
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I want you to come work here at our company.
My students have been eagerly awaiting the test results.
The Chinese are a hard-working people.
What was your favorite part?
Nobody likes that guy.
Will you stay here for a while?
They are arguing.
What's my prize?
Do you know anybody in Australia?
That's simply wrong.
I know Tom is all right now.
This one's on me.
Football is the most popular sport in Brazil.
I'm waiting for lunch.
I don't even know where to start.
They hold me responsible for it.
We have our differences.
I've seen it.
I miss my friends.
Can I make one observation?
I thought Tom had a day off.
Please get this work finished by Monday.
A bunch of people died in the explosion.
I'm a lawyer.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
How could you not tell me about this?
I suppose you're hungry.
Do you plan to go overseas?
Maybe it's not possible.
There's no one with Tom.
I want to go back to my cubicle.
Tom knew something wasn't right.
What is this?
It's not fake.
You have done very well.
You can't accomplish anything without taking a risk.
Are you sure they can do this?
You aren't a spy, are you?
The smoke alarm has never been maintained.
Tom isn't a good songwriter.
We have an English class today.
Put some salt on your meat.
She works hard.
Tom is three years older than you.
How much TV do you watch?
He asked his friends for help.
I know who my enemies are.
I don't want to leave you.
Tom is in charge of this project.
I know he's the one who did it.
It's a nice place, but I wouldn't live there.
A slip of the tongue is sometimes fatal to a politician.
What a day!
You're out of booze.
I might as well get a head start.
I've been bitten by mosquitos all over my arm.
Who were you hoping to talk to?
I was the only woman.
His manners are not those of a gentleman.
I hope this isn't a dream.
He couldn't fulfill the promise he made to his father.
I've got lots of questions.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
This word comes from Greek.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
If you tell people what they want to hear, they'll do what you want.
Do you want anything to eat?
Is there anyone here who knows someone in Australia?
What time does your watch say it is now?
Tom doesn't know Mary is in Boston.
I was accused of eating the boss's lunch.
It's a fake.
Repetition does not transform a lie into a truth.
I must get it fixed.
I woke up at five this morning.
Can I speak with you a moment?
You're such a flirt.
I broke your ashtray.
I don't know if this will be enough.
I have a pain here.
She doesn't speak my language.
Every mistake made me stronger.
I like the melody of this song.
Her anger was genuine.
Tom was three hours early.
I hope I can count on your discretion.
We have all kinds of time.
The doors are open.
Tom loves playing the piano.
How dare you speak like that to me!
I won't get caught.
Be careful about what you eat.
This is how it happened.
I'm pleased to see you.
He's a strange guy.
I'm between jobs.
I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor.
He's doing it right.
Tell me how I can help you.
Do you want in or not?
I'm not allowed to say anything.
We can't kill Tom.
Is it a wolf?
They met for the first time in London.
We should try that.
It was cold, so we lit a fire.
I would've liked to stay longer.
I am delighted to be here.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
Tom could never make me laugh the way you do.
Those doors should be closed.
I don't care about fashion.
Does he know what you did?
Write in the date yourself.
Let's sit down here.
Hurry up.
Can we talk about what happened that day?
I slept lying on my face.
Things are looking good.
It is useless to discuss the matter any further.
Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
He will have to go to the station.
What do we call you?
I thought you'd be here.
You will be able to read this book next year.
Let's figure out a better way to do this.
I had something planned.
I need to go.
This is boring.
Are these the only ones you have?
Many goods are now transported by air.
I don't know what to do anymore.
You're not alone anymore.
He always hums while working.
Why did you turn off the lights?
Your door was unlocked.
I was able to finish the work earlier than I had expected.
I don't love you that much.
Our new head office is in Tokyo.
You don't really expect me to tell you, do you?
You're the only one I trust.
Is this all there is?
Do you want me to take you home?
Where's your dog?
I'll tell you when we get there.
There's a problem.
Do you know his name?
Can you pronounce these words?
Remember to brush your teeth.
All the stores are closed.
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
In that case, let's go.
Do you want me to wait?
I rented a boat by the hour.
It is necessary for you to start now.
Would you introduce yourself?
He invited me to his house.
I'm an American citizen.
He took me by the hand.
Did you drop it?
Do you think I still love Tom?
Will you please help me?
All of these are Tom's.
Are we alone in the universe?
It's my fault, not yours.
I lied to protect you.
Thank you for your help.
I just found out that my boyfriend has been stepping out on me.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Stop talking and start listening.
I was thinking about getting married.
That's not at all funny.
We're not serious.
I like both.
Come alone.
I think he's tired.
That wasn't Tom's choice.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
I don't know either girl.
I have to stop.
Tom dreams of becoming a millionaire.
I must buy a new winter coat.
I forgot my shopping list at home.
The reason is simple.
I'm afraid of spiders.
I found the person who did that.
I know Tom will be cooperative.
Something's missing.
It was a waste time for all of us.
The rain stopped us from being able to play tennis outside.
What kind of beer do you want? "What do you have on tap?"
She was born in the 1950s.
You should have been more careful.
I hope you haven't caught a cold.
Those are the leftovers from lunch.
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs.
You should know better than to ask a lady her age.
We'll need more food than that.
I'd like to see that ring, please.
She disappeared.
I advise you never to live beyond your income.
Are your parents with you?
I haven't set foot outside the house today.
We always have a party on his birthday.
Do you have a cheaper room?
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
We waited in the park for a long time.
My friends call me Tom.
You have to be strong.
Tom mistook me for my older brother.
Be careful with that.
They are typical young people.
We all suffered.
It's your civic duty to vote.
I think I'm right.
I studied for one hour.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
I'm famous.
You will be paid according to your ability.
It's time.
I just didn't want to upset you.
Let's continue this tomorrow.
Tom was hiding behind a tree.
I have no plans whatsoever.
I want to see you first.
Take this medicine after each meal.
Tom called Mary to tell her that he thought she should stay in Boston for another three weeks.
My sister is a very good typist.
I get very angry when you don't answer my questions.
There was once a time when I could not trust others.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
I got one for Christmas.
You're lazy.
Don't treat me as if I were a child.
A bookstore in that location wouldn't make enough money to survive.
I forgot to ask Tom.
Cigarette smoke bothers me a lot.
Men with guns were waiting for them.
Tom checked Mary's pulse to see if she was still alive.
My house is in the northern part of the city.
I love nature.
I can't get this old TV to work.
This tree is the tallest and oldest in this forest.
I don't know where you work.
This food is unhealthy.
My shoes are too tight.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I've got to get going.
That really made sense.
I have few friends.
Had it not been for his aid, I could not have finished the work.
Are there any letters for me in today's mail?
I don't know who's going to help us.
You've got to tell Tom how you feel.
I think Tom is a mechanic.
Renting a car was the best option.
We waited.
Can you tell silver and tin apart?
We are anxious about our daughter's health.
I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I know Tom was unfair.
I would like to travel alone.
She looked around.
I hope it rains.
Give me a beer.
Are you Japanese?
Call me at this number.
A boat capsized.
I should've worn a hat.
Tom held a small flashlight in his left hand.
Since it stopped raining, he went out for a walk.
Did you speak with him about your projects?
Do you really think Tom is the only one here who can speak French?
I'm asking you as a friend.
You were hurt, weren't you?
Why don't you sit right there on the couch?
He saw suicide as the only way out.
She was asked to convince him to get his son to paint the house.
Can you distinguish her from her sister?
She is a short story writer.
The prime minister fell into the Danube and drowned.
Don't point your finger at me.
Tell them what you're doing here.
Tom certainly goes to bed early.
You don't have to go.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
I disagree completely.
It doesn't hurt at all.
I have been wearing this overcoat for more than five years.
I wonder what I should do today.
Jeans are now in fashion among girls.
Are you with us, Tom?
Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
I always arrive a little ahead of time.
Maybe I should go.
Mastering a foreign language requires a lot of hard work.
What's the real reason you're here?
I do not doubt it in the least.
It takes one to know one.
I'd like three pounds of chicken.
I'm counting on your help.
You should be proud of yourself.
The announcer spoke English.
You aren't one of us.
All I want is for you to be happy.
I don't have strep throat.
You will always be there.
Don't let him take advantage of you.
Help yourself to a drink.
Can anyone translate this sentence?
It was a lot of fun.
She speaks good English.
You're lucky that you have a job.
Did you already do your homework?
They know your name.
I'm not satisfied with my performance today.
I've taken care of everything.
He puts on airs.
Do you believe in God?
Do you like oysters?
I don't really want to pay that much for a new car.
I thought you were smart.
I bet you've got a few questions.
I can't imagine a day without you.
I'll arrange that.
What are you reading?
He overcame many difficulties.
You seem to want me to talk you out of doing that.
This is by far the best method.
Who took my keys?
How is your daughter?
You're not in a hurry, are you?
Did he show you the picture?
I only have one condition.
You need to sober up.
Tom will do a great job.
She wasn't able to contact him by phone.
I think this is yours.
I'm not complaining.
I met a friend there.
You should try to form the habit of using your dictionaries.
I'm sorry, but Tom isn't home.
I thought Tom was going to be here.
You're cool.
It's not our job to do that.
Don't touch this with your dirty hands.
You should not judge people by their appearance.
They want you dead.
I heard someone come into the room.
All my friends are invited here.
I'm addicted.
I hear Tom was the one who taught you how to play the cello.
I appreciate your time.
The prince was lost in the woods.
We can already do that.
How much is this pen?
What're you good at?
Tom buys and sells cars.
I need to know where you are.
The deadline is approaching.
My father drives very well.
I don't come here a lot.
No one has anything.
My sister didn't help me.
Tell me if you're happy.
I don't even want to be here.
I don't think you're schizophrenic.
Don't you think we deserve Tom's respect?
I'm supposed to go.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
He is what we call a walking dictionary.
The members of the committee are all men.
If you're going to apologize, you should do it right away.
He's too drunk.
Why don't dogs like cats?
What did the doctor say?
I forgot to shutter the windows before the storm hit.
I locked the door.
Tom wrote down Mary's phone number.
Do as you're told.
Don't breathe a word of what I've told you to anyone.
Do you think animals have souls?
I never expected that she would join us.
I'm always losing my keys.
I think it's going to get steadily hotter from now.
Something changed.
I had to wait for Tom to wake up.
I can tell you're upset.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't leave the house last Saturday.
I stepped aside so that he could pass.
The tires are very sticky.
I know I got it right this time.
I want to do that with Tom.
This is the place where Tom was born.
I went to the hospital to see my wife.
Come at any time you like.
Do you want us to try prying this door open?
He has many tenants on his land.
They look so cute together.
We traveled together.
She appears to have been rich.
Do you have a large family?
I knew I had a tough job ahead.
I'd like to go abroad someday.
You're very upset.
He went to the library.
We don't need to attend that meeting.
Tom was the love of my life.
Don't let this chance slip by.
Did you get fired from your last job?
Let me think a minute.
I think we need to be very careful not to hurt Tom's feelings.
They don't deserve to die.
I couldn't afford to do that.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
I am ready to follow you.
The room has two windows.
We plan to go as far as we can.
I think my parents know.
I want to file a complaint.
I always wear boots when it rains or snows.
Do you understand the risks?
What did you do this time?
Tom will probably win.
Come on, shake hands, boys!
The answer is yes.
Here's your change.
There was nothing I could've done.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
She couldn't hold back her laughter.
I want to go back to the way it was.
They don't even know why.
I admire your determination.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
I think you should do it.
Why do they want to talk to me?
Words cannot convey my feelings.
My father slept through the movie.
Do you remember your grandfather?
I don't have time to go there today.
I don't want you to go back to Boston.
This road is closed to cars.
Which is heavier, lead or gold?
Tom broke his arm.
I can't believe I'm going to lose my job.
No registration is required.
So far everything is all right.
Did you murder Tom?
You caught me off-guard.
You're young and strong.
You must have women throwing themselves at you all the time.
He's always at home on Sundays.
I don't have a boyfriend.
You can't blame him.
We look up to him as our leader.
I've told you over and over again not to do that.
I know you must be afraid.
Don't smoke too much.
It's all quite simple.
We wonder why.
He should be put in prison.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened at school yesterday.
How old is she? "She is twelve years old."
If I'd had the time, I would've dropped by your place.
Maybe we can make a deal.
I'm aware of my responsibilities.
I'm not one of them.
The patient requires constant care.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
I'll never forgive you.
I guess I don't have a choice.
Birds fly in the sky.
I didn't want any of that.
The television doesn't work.
I need you to do me a favor.
I'm not really that thirsty.
The lawyers argued the case for hours.
I want to practice with you.
Who phoned?
I'm tougher than you think.
Please tell me the story once more.
We don't meet very often recently.
Have a seat, won't you?
I've heard all about you.
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
Tom asked for more coffee.
He should have been an actor.
We'd better go back in.
I'm not sure I want to see it.
Are you having fun?
I really want to see Tom today.
She kicked him.
You're very funny.
I can't do this job without you.
She was absent from school because of sickness.
Tom sorted his laundry.
I remember having seen her somewhere.
It's very kind of you.
Tom doesn't like to speak French.
I think you've overcooked the broccoli.
Poaching is illegal.
Read as many books as possible.
I don't know where the bus stop is.
I'll get you a towel.
It's now my turn.
Shortly after the accident, the police came.
I want to know where they hid the money.
The room was locked.
May I use your toilet?
Tom and Mary are the same height.
Some girls are naturally pretty.
Didn't you hear her speaking French?
He sat next to her.
I came here when I was four.
Both sisters are very beautiful.
She came to like the new teacher.
Three weeks went by.
Mom! Stop! You're embarrassing me.
He was sitting and reading a book.
When did you fire Tom?
These boxes are made out of plastic.
He turned his attention to the picture.
How big is he?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
I've remarried.
I wonder how long Tom stayed there.
Tom spends about an hour a day practicing the piano.
There were too many of them.
I fell down the steps.
Tom wants to forgive his father for abandoning him.
My father is free this afternoon.
I don't have a computer.
It's morning.
Are you envious?
We have the same problems as you.
I think Tom is still sleeping.
You're a very gifted artist.
Do you have earrings on?
He doesn't remember anything.
I feel strongly about this.
Tom is a fairly good teacher.
He was very poor.
Do whatever it takes to get the job done.
Is it true that chicken soup will cure a cold?
I should forward this information to Tom.
This room smells musty.
He gave it to me for nothing.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
How many boys are in this class?
We loved you.
Which sports do you like?
Tom is your uncle.
Is this your favorite song?
I told you it was a waste of time.
Where are we going to eat tonight?
Do you enjoy working from home?
I thought you might be lonely, so I came over with a bottle of wine.
I suggest you go west.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
What've you got?
Neither one of them disagrees.
He carried a cane.
He went over to the other side.
What's behind the door?
Just as I was getting the hang of things, they changed the system.
There's something we have to do.
Why wasn't I informed earlier?
Tom keeps changing his mind.
You speak like your mother.
Can I still return this?
He never takes any notice of what his father says.
It's all in my report.
Who did that to you?
There's dust on the table.
I'll monitor your progress from my computer.
I want these people out of here.
I knew I'd be blamed.
He was expelled from school.
Are you happy with your weight?
Do you want to go for a swim?
We heard gunshots from next door.
I want you to open the window.
Tell the truth.
It matters.
Don't worry. We'll find Tom.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
He solved all those problems with ease.
I wasn't able to take care of Tom.
Tom ran barefoot on the beach.
His business has gone from bad to worse.
I understand it.
Tom does love you.
I know your type.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
The dead and wounded soon lay everywhere.
No one can keep me from going there.
You live here alone, don't you?
My room's a little messy.
Is that your new girlfriend?
I was told never to do that.
It's very hot today.
I will work.
I really like that dress.
He can't swim at all, but when it comes to skiing, he is the best.
It's a very demanding profession.
I'm careful not to spend too much.
He didn't tell me his name.
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona.
Americans eat a lot of meat.
How far are you prepared to go?
Tom doesn't think anybody else wants to come.
What changes should we expect?
That was just a joke.
I thought I was going to faint.
This book is old.
I can't decide which car to buy.
You're wasting your time trying to convince Tom.
Let me try again.
The children tried to imitate their teacher.
Tom did everything within his power to save the children that were trapped in the burning building.
He gave away all his money to charity.
I hate fluorescent lighting.
She has a bath every morning.
I can hear a saxophone somewhere.
Would you do me a favor?
Tom is at Mary's.
How are you connected?
Are you certain?
You can't just come here without an appointment.
I hope so.
I ordered several books from England.
Strictly speaking, she didn't like it at all, but she didn't say a thing.
My sister is always weighing herself.
The garden was full of beautiful flowers.
This doll costs only sixty cents.
Their names have escaped me.
Your country thanks you.
Who are you voting for?
I'm not as interested in politics as you are.
What happened after that?
Tell me a bedtime story.
You must be exhausted.
I'd love to talk to you.
I have some errands to run.
Hi! I'm new here.
He examined the spare parts one after another.
You can't leave me now.
Stop acting like a child.
I'd like to ask you something.
I've been accused of murder.
It has been raining since yesterday.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
I'm coming with you.
She stared at him with hatred.
Are you really that ignorant?
He was knee deep in mud.
Choose something.
Her eyes were red from crying.
We've got a room for you.
When did your sister leave Tokyo for London?
Let me get back to you.
We had nothing to eat.
We're doing everything we can to find your daughter.
Are you trying to impress me?
Give someone else a chance.
I just want you out of my house.
Finish your drink.
I woke up at sunrise.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
I'm no saint.
She lent them a hand with their luggage.
What are these things used for?
Don't drag me into this.
Five plus three is eight.
He was alone in the room.
I'm still positive.
They arrived in Paris at the same time.
The fire was extinguished at once.
If I had money, I could buy it.
What did you do with that?
I never thought I would get married.
I know your roommate.
He not only speaks French, but he speaks Spanish, too.
You like everyone.
The good news is that you don't have cancer.
I've just finished lunch.
Don't read in this room.
According to a recent study, the average life span of the Japanese is still increasing.
How did we get to this point?
He comes into contact with all kinds of people.
I don't see the difference.
That apple is big.
You're not cooperating.
He is a brave man.
You have no life.
Someone's coming.
I travel light.
I cried when Tom told me about that.
You decide.
We missed our train.
How much is it per box?
Were you even tempted?
She caught me by the arm.
I think I'm drunk.
You're quiet.
I knew this was a bad idea.
I'll peel an orange for you.
The bellows are not working.
Everybody seeks happiness.
How are you related?
I just want to help fix the problem.
Tom told me Mary was dead.
It's not for you.
Her mother is a most beautiful woman.
Eat everything.
They are very kind.
This diagram will illustrate what I mean.
Do you really mean it?
She reminds me very much of her mother.
I know what I'm talking about.
Tom kissed Mary on the neck.
We've been warned.
Recycling reduces pollution and waste.
I refuse.
It's gorgeous.
Could you give me a ride?
She lives in New York.
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
What's your favorite fruit?
Will he succeed or fail?
Did you see anyone leave?
Don't change a thing.
I'd like a chance to explain why I made this choice.
Do you ever think about that guy?
I like to run.
He saw that he was wrong.
Are you tired?
I'd like orange juice.
I didn't know about his plan.
I agree with you completely.
Where were you when your wife disappeared, Tom?
She might know the answer.
Do you know who he was?
Why are you asking these questions?
We found the front door locked.
I'm just not sure.
That's a really wonderful plan.
Tom looked at his reflection in the mirror.
It's all about money.
Did something happen at home?
They each received a present.
Tom's bitten his nails right down to the quick.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I know what we can do.
Everyone started arguing.
Write carefully and legibly.
Is that mandatory?
Sea levels around the world are rising.
It's old and clunky.
Nobody was home.
We got off on the wrong foot.
Where's that smell coming from?
Anybody can make a mistake.
He asked his teacher stupid questions.
Tom talked about Boston.
This word has two meanings.
I'll join you there later.
I won't let you down.
Are you lonely?
He is a physicist.
Tom needs me.
We had a lot of snow last year.
You always were a good dancer.
Tom is exactly three weeks old.
I can't play tennis as well as Tom.
Just don't tell anyone, OK?
That job wasn't very interesting. However, the pay was good.
She's wearing eye shadow.
I will do whatever you tell me to do.
His manners aren't those of a gentleman.
I thought you were broke.
Developing political awareness takes time.
I wish somebody would help me do that.
I can only speak for myself.
From the look of the sky, it may begin to snow tonight.
There are many new programs to watch this spring.
You will keep your word, won't you?
Everybody in the park looked up at the hot air balloon.
Everyone is free to contribute.
Tom showed me the poems that he'd written when he was a teenager.
Supper is a simple meal.
Are you planning on staying in Boston for a long time?
We want to get to know you better.
We all learned the poem by heart.
I prefer modern furniture.
I returned home by train.
The mayor is not available now.
Can you do it or not?
Tom likes the idea, too.
I'll pay.
As soon as we got to the lake, we started swimming.
Today, I'm busy getting ready for my trip.
I have a job for you.
I ran out of gas.
This child has been adopted.
What is your earliest memory from childhood?
I took advantage of an opportunity.
How do you like Japan?
It's great to meet you.
Everyone was pushing, trying to escape.
Minnesota's state bird is the mosquito.
Why don't you just start at the beginning?
I want to ask a favor of you.
Let's sit here on the grass.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
You can't keep this a secret.
She was naive.
I want to negotiate.
He doesn't come here every day.
Tom sat alone with a half-empty bottle of wine.
Does that mean that we won?
Were you hurt?
I told you it wouldn't work, didn't I?
At first, the Indians were friendly.
This school has no heating.
That's what we all thought.
Go right ahead.
They should have the right to decide for themselves.
I don't deserve to live.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
What do you have in mind?
It's as you say.
I want to hold your hand.
I didn't expect it.
I've come a long way.
Come whenever you want.
We know enough.
Look at my new car.
Tom is respected in the business community because he is always fair and square in his dealings with others.
My plan worked.
Please read the text below.
If you calculate the electric field using this equation, the result comes out like the following.
My father is an expert surgeon.
Please don't speak so fast.
I have to make another call.
This is a joke.
Tom can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke.
How did you happen to see them doing it?
I'm glad to be home.
That seems highly unlikely.
You don't have to apologize.
We suggest you come early tonight.
I should call a doctor.
Gambling is illegal.
What are we supposed to do now?
There is nothing to cancel.
He bowed to his teacher.
Where should we go?
Why did you listen to them?
Those countries used to belong to France.
She sued him.
We spent too much for this.
This is acceptable.
Stop being so nice.
You're cool.
I don't like this city at all.
She told him that he was right.
I can speak a little.
We're the best at what we do.
Is your car comfortable?
My income is twice as large as yours is.
I don't care what people say.
Tom should have told me earlier.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
I wish I had more money with me.
I wasn't prepared for this.
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
He can't keep time.
Hey, guys. What's up?
We must wait.
Do you want more ice cream?
I wish you'd told me before.
Do you think she has a chance of winning?
The noise gets on my nerves.
Wires are used to convey electricity.
What was this all about?
That's all I have.
He works for an advertising agency.
I need another drink.
You'd better not wait here.
I want this computer repaired.
What a disappointment!
Tom was that kind of person.
I'm really feeling kind of strange.
I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?
Tom told me you were in Boston.
Please turn off the lights.
Everybody blames you.
Tom found out later that the woman he met in the park was Mary.
Please move the TV set to the left.
Thanks for paying for the meal.
You're my boss.
I want you to stay on the beach.
Pay attention to the road.
I guess it's OK.
We just have to be patient.
I'm longing to see him.
I love your garden.
There were no radios in those days.
How many categories are there?
You can have someone do it for you.
They ate and drank wine.
I'm very glad that you're here.
When he got to the station, the train had already left.
We drank a lot.
They can't get out.
He will also go.
Tom described the problem in detail.
No comment.
They wouldn't have done anything.
Try to rest.
Is there any chance of my borrowing your typewriter?
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
How long does it take to get to Vienna on foot? he inquired.
I can't get the car to start.
One of these eggs hasn't hatched yet.
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
Oh, don't be like that.
I'll be late for school!
Thank you for stopping by.
I'm sorry about my mistake.
Is that all of them?
That can't be good for you.
You must control yourself.
Where were you?
Have you ever been kissed before?
He's my partner.
How could you do this to them?
I can't believe my eyes.
Is there a doctor in the house?
He opened his mouth wide.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
Do you really think Tom will do that?
That's all we need.
Mum's the word.
They smell bad.
Children like fairy tales.
Did you give him up?
You're trespassing here.
Tom almost fainted.
I can't believe you're here.
The paper is white.
Close the door, please.
I'll get you.
Please check the attached file.
Where did you go to college?
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
We lay on the grass.
Empty your pockets and put everything on the table.
He was a weak and delicate child.
What do you feel like eating?
Do you have any knowledge of this matter?
It's a girl thing.
Who's the woman in the brown coat?
All I think about is you.
I had the exact same feeling.
There are some apples in that box.
I don't have a problem with this.
I think I touched a nerve.
This house is very small.
I am accustomed to eating this sort of food.
Let's go by bus.
Don't make fun of me.
Give it to whoever needs it.
Since he was feeling sick, he stayed home from school.
I left earlier than my sister.
He ran a great risk in the jungle.
I didn't need anyone's help.
I just want Tom to leave me alone.
I'm proud to have him as a friend.
Anything can happen.
The car turned to the left.
Are you sure you don't want to live at home with your parents?
I usually don't make mistakes.
I don't want to go bald when I'm still young.
We're not doing it that way.
You're the one I've been wanting to meet.
We're doing this for the money.
I think you did an excellent job.
We really have to be on our way.
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
I want to do this alone.
Tom is a hard person to please.
All of us stared at her.
He died in his bed.
This is on sale.
After she lost her job, she couldn't afford to feed her dogs, so she gave them away.
You're fun.
I don't have any close friends.
Leave me alone, she said angrily.
I'd do the same for you.
Her father died.
Can you still remember where we first met?
What do you know about all this?
I can't believe you fell for that.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
You're prisoners.
I know a good place for dinner.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
You've had enough.
I am taking a couple of days off.
We became good friends.
He changed his job.
I'm not nervous at all.
Did you hurt yourself?
When did Tom come see you?
Are you the bank manager?
We're not getting married.
Tom was always there for me.
Tom shouldn't say things like that to Mary.
What good would come of it?
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
I walked to school.
She dressed herself quickly.
Your pencils need sharpening.
Can you please write that down?
I'll be around all day.
Everything seems normal enough.
You get what you pay for.
Doctors are the worst patients.
Everyone was looking at me.
I can't remember anything about that night.
Tom thinks women in America wear too much perfume.
Five minutes' walk brought us to the park.
Where do you work now?
Have you ever dyed your hair?
Tom's computer is not responding.
We have a similar predicament.
We must do it again.
I must do something.
I would prefer that you didn't submit this.
Let's throw all this stuff away.
Nobody could remember the sequence of events.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
What a beautiful dress!
He came back from China.
There was a lot of wind.
No one can do that.
He used a headache as an excuse for leaving early.
I'm first.
Tom needs work.
Tell me where you got this.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
Tom was worried about his grades.
Please feel free to make suggestions.
I noticed you weren't at home last night.
Where is the problem?
I could get used to this.
You're winning, aren't you?
I wonder if someone could help me do this.
Many American planes were shot down.
I would never let you down.
I never should've come here.
Tom tried to talk to Mary, but she didn't want to talk to him.
He made fun of my accent.
I had to work last weekend.
Don't make this decision today.
They don't make 'em like they used to.
I regret eating those oysters.
Tom is a very good cook.
Forget about that right now.
Tom had to do everything himself.
A red light was glowing in the dark.
It's not hard to find.
He has trouble remembering names.
Why don't you give us a moment to talk?
The kids are disappointed.
We need more doctors like you.
This was too much for Tom.
Hang on a bit until I'm ready.
It's getting warmer day by day.
I never went back.
You won't have a chance.
Do you understand what's going on?
Do you think I should go alone?
Have a nice trip.
I already have plans for this weekend.
I just want to get married.
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
I couldn't help but smile.
I want to know exactly what you did.
This is awful.
Be polite, but firm.
I'm going to get myself some coffee. Do you want some?
Do you know who wrote this book?
Did you hear it?
Do what he says.
The street was dark.
Tom is looking for another job.
Exhaust from factories pollutes the air.
He carries a bag on his back.
Tom is taking care of me.
I've checked the records.
Which one is broken?
Are you a cop?
I just want to be clear.
I bought the least expensive pair of shoes in the store.
This is where you're wrong.
He is the boss's private secretary.
The trees are already bare.
I don't agree with you.
I don't know whether he'll come by train or by car.
You're naive.
I can't stand that noise.
Water expands with heat.
Are they all the same?
I need to talk to you about an urgent matter.
I found it difficult to put it into practice.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
Nobody told me it was going to get this cold.
Where they burn books, they will eventually burn people.
How do I do that?
I just got back from my morning swim.
I was foolish enough to believe it.
Will that be all?
There's nothing here.
Let's play soccer.
I expect him to help me.
Tom must've realized it was a rhetorical question, because he didn't answer.
We need to find somebody who can help us.
I took the opportunity to visit the museum.
Ever since he arrived, everything has changed.
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
The senator was censured by the congressional ethics committee.
She helped him overcome his sadness.
I know Tom is psyched.
It wasn't difficult to do that.
I think we've made our point.
You're not very funny.
This restaurant is badly managed.
If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
It was all gone.
These flowers you see are roses.
I don't care if you go or not. I'm going anyway.
I climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji.
I'll sign it.

Tom has made his choice.
Is it necessary for me to explain the reason to him?
Peace talks will begin next week.
We must make up for the loss.
She spoke Japanese well.
Nobody wants to do it?
Introverts often find it difficult to make new friends.
Their teacher praised them.
Let Tom make the decisions.
I couldn't let Tom go without saying goodbye.
Physics is my weak subject.
I'll have to explain that to my father.
Is there a zoo in Boston?
Throw the ball.
Tell them that they're wrong.
The Japanese economy developed rapidly.
Things didn't turn out the way Tom expected.
Tom sent Mary a selfie.
We want to talk.
She kept on crying.
Where's the changing room?
Hurry up, and you'll catch the bus.
Tom got another letter from Mary today.
You're so wrong.
I was watching TV at this time yesterday.
Don't judge people by their appearance.
Tom never stays more than a week.
She wants to live in the city.
How dare you say such a thing!
My girlfriend is crying.
That's a strange question.
I was bored.
You are not Japanese.
I am afraid he will fail.
Who forced you to do that?
Is that your wife?
She gave him his first kiss.
I thought you might be interested in this.
We're getting closer.
I had such high hopes for you.
This is a miracle.
I watched a Swedish movie last night.

He is in charge of entertaining the foreign guests.
I will stop you.
There were a lot of people at the concert.
It's this book.
I appreciate your advice.
I didn't realize you were here.
It has been raining since last Thursday.
It's a plausible diagnosis.
I suppose I'll have to be more careful in the future.

What is missing?

He ignored me.
I want you to be my friend.
Tom is my boss.
I appreciate this.
I'll make some coffee.
I was just a kid then.
You're disgusting.
Tom should be back by October.
I don't like to see food go to waste.
Forget it!
He isn't as old as my brother.
I made a couple calls.
Are you going or staying?
I took risks.
There were boxes everywhere.
Do you play golf?
Take no chances.
These cups are all broken.
The dogs barked all night.
What can you give me?
Can the rumor be true?
Tom used to be aggressive.
I know your son.
You guys can do it if you try.
They relaxed in front of the fire.
Stop where you are.
Isn't that what I said?
I won't tolerate such language!
Today is September first.
She runs faster than I do.
Not everyone got along.
I wonder where to hang this picture that Tom gave me.
Can you push the door open?
This dog is a mongrel.

I studied it thoroughly.
We could walk.
He's an independent thinker.
She denied having been there.
She hates fish and never eats any.
You have a decision to make.
We'd like you to sing a song.
What kind of fuel do you use in this machine?
All the boys in class worked hard.
Can this be just between you and me?
Tom didn't get up as early as he usually does.
Why do I have to do this by myself?
I did try to warn you.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Is there a washing machine in the house?
I found what you were looking for in the trunk of my car.
She pleaded with him to not leave.
They camped on the beach.
We saw what looked like an oasis in the desert.

Everyone laughed.
I didn't expect help.
They replaced the broken television with a new one.
Where are they swimming?
As soon as he felt his house shake, he rushed out into the garden.
I don't like what you did to Tom.
I'm sure there's a connection.

What's the weather like?
The bill, please.

I couldn't have done that if you hadn't been helping me.
He never talked about it.
He lives close by.
Do you have any idea what Tom was doing in Boston?
Everyone got something for Christmas.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
Tom and Mary studied together.
She listened to music for hours.
I'm just trying to help.
I didn't write that letter.
Don't look down on him just because he's poor.
Did the soup taste good?
I read a lot of novels.
Women seem to like him for some reason.
The answer to that's obvious.
I've come a long way to see you.
I've always wanted to meet your younger brother.

This is for my friend.
Don't do two things at a time.
I'm sure everything's OK.
I want to visit Australia one day.
I still have trouble believing it.

She is as busy as a bee.
I'll be with you in a moment.
We'll help you do that.

Tom doesn't know anything about computers.
A dog followed me to my school.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
Everybody in the car said they wanted to get out and stretch their legs.
He has few friends.
That's just what we need.
It didn't work for me either.
I wish I could turn back time.
I'm shorter than him.
Who'd want to hire Tom?
I came here yesterday.
Don't be so shy.
You said it was important.
She is proud of her daughter.
This road curves gently to the right.
You're probably too young to understand why we have to do this.
I couldn't care less.

I am dying to see her again.
So long.
Babies are interesting to watch.
Two glasses of orange juice, please.
As had been expected, the weather turned out to be very fine.
Your problem is you don't study enough.
You've made no allowance for the fact that he is young.
I need space.
Mary hid the money in her bra.
I admit that at first I didn't like you.
She kissed me, not him.
Stop changing the subject.
The idea was good.
She's a real gossip.
Her family is very large.
We're not that stupid.
I didn't know you were rich.
That seems suspicious to me.

I am not certain about that.

Thousands of people were there.
Is it safe to skate on this lake?
I don't remember her name anymore.

He often sits by me and listens to music.
I want you gone.
Primitive calculating machines existed long before computers were developed.
I don't like being surprised.
Thanks a bunch.
Your resume is very impressive.

When will you stop scheming?
That's a good point.
I have a couple questions.
Tom likes that one.
Are you no longer in pain?
I'll do everything you tell me to do.
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston.
He was wide awake.
I wanted to thank you for what you did today.
We were all concerned.
I can't imagine that.
I was sympathetic.
He speaks Russian.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
He is a little over forty.
This is the house where I lived when I was a child.
Did the car look old?

I'm not good at multitasking.

Shall I begin?
A cup of tea, please.
I was wondering when you were going to tell me you loved me.
The goods will be delivered free of charge.

I appreciate your patience.
We can't go.
I saw a shape in the dark.
This is getting out of hand.
You won't believe this.
Does anyone care?

They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
It's a bit greasy.
I need some get-up-and-go.

We met in Boston.
Do you have any plans for tonight?

My friend was arrested for speeding.
Aren't you afraid of anything?
That's a myth.
I will miss you.
Do you want me to explain it again?
They brought trouble on themselves.
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
You're exhausted.
He objected to our plan.
Keep your head low.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.

This is not acceptable.
I'm the only one who can do that.
We all know what happened here.

Where are you living?
I think she will come.
How many kids do you have?
We're not all teachers.
You did well, Tom.
All the boys looked down.
She hired him as an interpreter because she had heard that he was the best.
We all hate Tom.
Has anyone thought about this?
You don't have to explain.
I want to learn to play the guitar like you.
He can talk to spirits.
We're going to another party after this one.
Tom is packing.
I should tell you about that sometime.
Are your eyes bad?
You're my boss.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
She disguised herself as him.
Did you see anybody else?
Wouldn't you like to drink some tea?
I need to practice my French.
The students of this school are kind.
Tom kissed Mary good night.
Who is your mother?
You must let me handle this.
The ice melted into a puddle of water.
I'm sure that's wrong.
It being Sunday, the shop was closed.
Where are you hurt?
He was patient.
We listen to music.
You're like your sister.
She began to gain weight.
I'm having trouble with my roommate. He eats all my food.
It's just a scratch, OK?
I hope this is resolved quickly.
That bottle is in the dirt.
He volunteered to help her.
It's all over now.
I never touched it.
Why don't you take a nap?
Tom's parents are missing.
It might just be a coincidence.
Tom always asks me the same question.
I don't think Mary is as pretty as her sister.
Those were his actual words.
Tom asked me to go with him.
Let's start with the why.
You should turn off your cell phone.
I know your feelings are hurt.
Tom's free.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
Does it hurt when you chew?
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
I'm sorry.
You're exhausted.
Is everybody happy now?
He had a blue jacket on.
Do you want to go to the aquarium?
The earthquake caused widespread damage.
The wall was coated with paint.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I'll never forget you.
Salt is necessary for cooking.
Tom is living in my old house.
She was advised by him to stop smoking.
Several people have noticed this problem.
Easy does it.
Don't be sorry.
Leave the room immediately.
Why are you calling Tom?
Don't trust anybody.
What time is dinner served?
I am very sorry.
Put it in the closet.
Twenty families live here.
How are you planning to do that?
He's addicted to heroin.
Taste this wine to see if you like it.
You should know it.
I have some good news to share.
It is very kind of you to come and see me.
He found a good place for me.
I'll do what the boss tells me.
I want to tell you something important.
I'm sure that's what Tom would've wanted.
Do you want us to go with you?
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
The blouse is clean.
There are many talented people in our city, but Tom isn't one of them.
Can I have a word with you alone?
As soon as he was left alone, he opened the letter.
He will be a good teacher.
Tom probably won't win.
You're wonderful.
I know what can happen here.
This bus will take you to the museum.
I'm extremely fat.
Tom hasn't driven in years.
I'm already ready.
I'll hang onto it for now.
He put on his glasses and began to read.
We can talk.
You can't just barge in here whenever you feel like it.
Let's not go into details.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
My computer's acting up.
How can I tell if I'm really in love?
I was sitting behind Tom.
He will join us later.
If you wish, I'll ask.
This movie is suitable for children.
There are many parks in Boston.
I want all my children to go to college.
Bring a date.
She advised him to walk instead of taking a bus.
Playing Russian roulette isn't really a good idea.
She laid the magazine on the table.
I must say I'm a bit disappointed.
I need change for the bus.
Find somebody else.
Tom isn't a good teacher.
This is a matter of great importance.
My uncle lives in Madrid, the capital of Spain.
She suggested that the customer buy a blue tie.
That helps a lot.
It's a luxury we can't afford.
What exactly is that?
I'm very upset.
You've gotta be kidding!
I would like you to introduce me to her.
I don't know that much about you.
I saw a boy crossing the street.
You said we'd never catch Tom.
I'm not frightened of anything.
We advertise our products on TV.
Everyone's dead.
You're the one who trained me.
I just emailed you.
I need some water.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
They are five in all.
Don't you see what you've become?
He didn't go and I didn't either.
You seem to want me to talk you out of doing that.
Go back to work.
We set a trap to catch a fox.
She could hardly keep from laughing when she saw the dress.
I'm not running away.
I figured you'd understand.
I want to make her happy.
The gunman was found to be insane.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
Don't worry about others.
I don't drink before noon.
I met my friend on the street.
He is much older than he looks.
French is a difficult language.
Tom and Mary don't seem to really talk to each other all that much.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
I didn't need to understand French to know that they were angry.
I'm waiting for my driver.
Would you please show me that skirt?
I've got some very good news.
Do you have them?
Empty your bags.
Where is the evidence?
I want you to wait for me.
Getting married is a serious matter.
Portugal has decriminalized the personal possession of drugs.
I felt happy.
Your pencils need sharpening.
He argues that the administration must look for alternative sources of revenue.
I have a car.
Tom didn't clap after Mary's performance.
I'm fed up with him always preaching to me.
I told you to stay in the house.
I suppose you are right.
Don't feel obligated to talk if you don't want to.
Did she like it?
We want change.
People notice every move he makes.
How can I prevent this from happening?
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
We saw everything.
This time, you've gone too far.
Are we broke?
Why are you standing there?
That story can't be true.
I'll be back soon. I have to run to the post office.
Tom wants an answer.
It's going to be fine.
I have quit smoking and drinking.
This coat is too short on me.
Tom is almost thirty years old.
This is the perfect place.
She must've been beautiful when she was young.
We've had bad weather recently.
It was really dark.
Half a million children still face malnutrition in Niger.
He did it willingly.
Tom doesn't seem tired.
I know what you're probably thinking.
I'm so happy to finally be back home.
He sent the letter back unopened.
He always makes cynical remarks to me.
I'd like you to meet him.
I daydreamed all day.
Did you drive her home last night?
She suggested that I cancel the meeting.
I went to your school.
They can't hurt you.
Your life's in danger.
Ask her what her name is.
He continued the experiment.
We study music.
Tom hates it when Mary does that.
This book was new.
Tom couldn't have done it any better.
Is there a hospital around here?
Tom is depressed and lonely.
You know the drill.
Where are you heading?
Everything went wrong.
If I find your passport, I'll call you.
We tried to cheer him up.
Don't underestimate me.
I just don't believe you.
We want to solve that problem.
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
I don't know what's going on around here, but I intend to find out.
I'm just telling you the truth.
I must help you.
The streets of New York are very wide.
I had help.
What makes you think that I'm against that?
There isn't much butter left in the refrigerator.
She cried and cried, but nobody came to comfort her.
We'll find it.
The number of cases of whooping cough is on the rise in the last years.
I have never seen anyone like him.
He likes to work in the garden.
There's nobody there.
He didn't carry out his promise.
Take a sip of this.
Take a shower.
How could anyone not like music?
Have you ever been in prison?
I'd hate to be in your shoes.
Do you believe in UFOs?
Who will pay?
Is he Japanese?
I saw you.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
He went on to demonstrate how to use the machine.
Cotton mittens will prevent the baby from scratching his own face.
I bought an umbrella.
It failed.
Children are prohibited from smoking.
Have you told any of this to the police?
Have you thought about what we talked about the other night?
This desk is too heavy to lift.
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
It's not just illegal, it's also dangerous.
They're special.
The export of arms was prohibited.
You left your keys in the door.
Tom is supposed to call around 2:30.
She heard him scream, so she ran into his bedroom.
It's the sort of day when you'd like to stay in bed.
I think we did OK.
Are you saying my life is in danger?
His income is now double what it was ten years ago.
He's about the same age as you are.
Do you think it works?
I don't know who any of you are.
I want something good to eat.
I don't need your money.
It's been a hard year.
The meeting's about to start.
The cat sat on the mat.
I suggested that we go fishing.
I've just seen Tom.
I figured it out by myself.
I'll only ask you this question once.
We need to think about what'll happen if we don't do that.
Would you like a drink?
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
You're psyched.
I think we should all go together.
Someday, we'll know.
Tom and I are separated.
How on earth did you get it?
Tom isn't in good shape.
If you were to hear him speak French, you would take him for a Frenchman.
You must overcome the difficulties.
Which floor do you live on?
If you're wrong, admit it. If you're right, be quiet.
Where's the nearest station?
She works as a nurse in the local hospital.
Ninety-five percent of orphans are older than 5 years old.
His words surprised me.
What did I trip over?
Please write down my address.
Tom is taking good care of himself.
You're being weird.
Go back to your seats.
That's not how it works.
It was his silence that made her angry.
What happened today?
I'm sure of his success.
He hung up.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
Tom is thinking about getting married.
I pretended to work.
Isn't one of you enough?
Don't let your mother know that.
I'm hanging a picture of my grandmother on the wall.
That's why we want you.
I heard him go down the stairs.
I prefer to work at night.
Tom was born before his twin brother.
If I were in her place, I wouldn't give up yet.
Don't tell anyone.
The enemy torpedoed our ship.
I'm not sure what he was thinking.
He was jogging down the beach.
Each student has a locker.
We have other priorities at the moment.
I've never witnessed so much debauchery in my entire life.
I asked Tom if I could play his guitar.
I tried to keep Tom from doing that.
You're very forward.
Let's not exaggerate the facts.
I didn't think anything of it.
We had so much fun together.
When are you planning to tie the knot?
Why did you ask Tom to do that when you knew he couldn't do it?
There are no food stores in the immediate area.
It's freezing outside.
He goes fishing every other day.
Sorry to bother you, but I'm afraid something urgent has come up.
Where were you for the whole afternoon?
You're worried, aren't you?
Tom never liked school.
I knew that Tom was a cook.
He finished drinking one beer and ordered another.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
He had no objection.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
In case of fire, break the glass and push the red button.
I won't have time to do that today.
Do you have an airplane ticket back home?
Let me explain it with a diagram.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
I did all the work myself.
I come from England.
The roads were empty.
Help me with my homework, please.
When do you swim? "I swim in July."
There've been times when doing that has caused us problems.
You must find work.
Your daughter is very pretty.
She has a brilliant future.
Her sister looks young.
You're never at home.
I can't talk about that right now.
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?
It is a very difficult job for us.
She suggested that I write to him at once.
I don't know my address yet, I'm going to stay with my friend for a while.
That's what friends are for.
I like bananas more than apples.
You speak French a lot better than me.
Tom told me Mary was busy.
I won't close the door.
My father fixes broken chairs.
You have some books.
Tell them what happened.
What's the problem anyway?
I need to verify everything you've told us.
You need to go on a diet.
I don't want to end up in court.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
I'm not fat.
Do you like oysters?
I'm not busy right now.
I studied in Boston from 2003 to 2007.
I started to learn English with the aim of becoming a teacher.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
Printing ink is in short supply.
You're the one who trained me.
I can recommend a good lawyer.
The old man stopped suddenly and looked back.
If you need my advice, I'd be glad to give it to you.
Where are the apples?
You've probably heard of me.
Talking to your plants doesn't help them grow faster.
Do you see a rose?
Everyone likes her.
Tom wants to know why.
What are you so angry about?
We can't do this again.
The lawyer seems to think it'll be an open and shut case.
If you tell Tom what to do, he'll do it.
Did you enjoy your winter holidays?
Perhaps we should consider what would happen if we don't do this.
You're not one of us.
I feel really strongly about it.
It is to be expected.
This is the same necklace that I lost yesterday.
We're adaptable.
He was always pulling my leg when we worked together.
I'd like to leave this town and never come back.
He must be a good walker to have walked such a long distance.
May I take your picture?
Anything new?
It was a complicated question.
I'm not going to the movies tomorrow.
Who's at home?
Please don't ever do that again.
I bought this camera yesterday.
I believe in what they said.
At your age, I would think so, too.
What other choice do we have?
What would you like to eat?
I don't think your plan will work.
When did you come?
You're not dead yet.
I want to have something to remember you by.
Tom wasn't drunk.
I'm no different than you.
Let's leave when you are ready.
The company's failed.
I hope that she will help me.
She caught a cold last night.
Tom and Mary are both very hungry.
They had a lovely time together.
Of course, I understand.
I'm staying at a hotel not far from here.
Who are you to decide?
Gay marriage is legal here.
I'm sorry, but I can't stay for long.
I would never do it again.
The street in front of my house is pretty narrow.
I meet him from time to time.
If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me.
That sound is annoying.
No one left.
You don't have to take your umbrella with you.
The farmer plowed his field all day.
I didn't know anything.
That's not the answer.
Count the apples in the basket.
They have to be very careful.
I truly didn't know you felt this way.
She didn't want him to play poker.
They just want to have fun.
Do you remember what to do?
Your voice sounds very familiar to me.
The old book was moldy.
Can you stay for a while?
He asked his wife if she was coming with him.
These ties are very expensive.
How do you know where to go?
Why do you need a hammer?
I don't have time for you.
I won't let you boss me around anymore.
Tom can get in touch with Mary by email.
Have you eaten supper yet?
We introduced ourselves to each other.
I don't like studying.
They tried to cheer me up.
Nobody tells the truth anymore.
She talked childishly.
We appreciate your cooperation.
I don't know the truth.
I bought a new fountain pen.
My dad died before I was born.
That does make me feel better.
Don't take me seriously. I'm only joking.
I thought you were a friend.
He predicted she would win.
I've got eyes.
Can we go to the lake and watch the sunrise?
What do you want to talk to me about?
I want you out of my office.
Tom told me that he hadn't done that yet.
That makes no difference.
Why do you care so much?
Tom deserves a promotion.
We'll only wait three more hours.
The sky is blue.
He wrote to me yesterday.
This is Tom's room.
Let's approach the problem from a different angle.
You're grumpy.
Are you still there?
I will deal with him myself.
He cut off a slice of meat.
Can you solve the puzzle?
I'm in my underwear.
How long does it take to get to the station?
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
I hugged her.
Tom is handsome and charismatic.
She watched him draw a picture.
The national debt is growing.
Is that you?
Don't come in my room without knocking.
He was wearing glasses.
It's not yet time.
I cannot understand what happened.
Take this chair. It's sturdy.
I'll miss this place once I leave.
Everybody likes to goof off.
I've climbed Mt. Fuji three times.
She is anxious about her father's health.
I think we're in trouble.
What is wrong with that guy?
My mother has gone shopping.
He shared his soup with me.
I listened.
She comes from a good family.
These are my suitcases.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I couldn't help Tom.
How do you feel about the proposed changes?
I ordered this swimsuit from France.
No one noticed.
Would you buy that?
Who taught you how to do that?
You like everyone.
As far as I know, this is the latest edition.
You ran a red light.
I hope we can make it to your party.
He couldn't find the house.
Could you do me a favor?
How many English words do you know?
How are you?
Three were wounded.
Who brought this?
He was naive.
When did you come to Japan?
She's asking how that's possible.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I'll be back in just a second.
Folks, it's time I was leaving.
The sky grew darker and darker, and the wind blew harder and harder.
I'll tell someone.
I don't remember exactly.
Don't be a chicken.
We need sleep.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
She treated him very well.
You ought not to make fun of them.
Tom's father is in jail.
Charge it to my account.
I'll lend you any book that I have, as long as you keep it clean.
We're getting a lot of things done.
I stayed in bed all morning.
Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?
Tom's well.
What a lovely dress!
The Milky Way consists of about a hundred billion stars.
I found the book by accident.
We will only consent on that condition.
Lock the office.
How do you expect me to pay this?
Is this your bike?
I didn't plan on staying here so long.
Give me a week.
I can come.
Tom was a model inmate.
I really want to believe you.
Shut your eyes.
We heard the door shut.
It doesn't work, does it?
No one is talking.
I really can't be late.
Should we intervene?
Why are we even talking about this?
Tom ordered a drink.
A monument has been erected to the memory of the deceased.
The magician made birds appear and disappear.
I want you back today.
Can I join you?
How did you accomplish this?
He likes to just sit around and play video games all day.
You are to blame.
Tom sang better than Mary did.
Tom is a professional killer.
When did you start dating?
I know you didn't really want to come on this trip.
I will play soccer tomorrow.
Was Tom the one who brought this?
Those children are making too much noise.
Tom seems to be dissatisfied.
What time are you going on duty?
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
I had a pleasant dream last night.
Did you have a good night last night?
Tom saw Mary break the window.
I'm calling to see if you'd be interested in going to Boston with me next week.
Did you have any luck?
I'd rather not eat the meat from an animal that was cloned.
You're not allowed in there.
I rang the doorbell.
I like walking by myself.
Your watch is on the desk.
May I have a glass of water?
Do you know anyone from Boston?
Did anyone else help you?
You can take your time.
Don't touch my camera.
In front of the university, there are some bookstores.
They'll find us.
I think it's time for me to buy a new car.
Is his story true?
It looks like we didn't understand him.
I don't think Tom realized just how much Mary loved him.
Can you tell what's wrong with it?
I'll wash the dishes.
I left my umbrella here last night.
I took a nap.
My father might be at home now.
I must concentrate.
The telephone was invented by Bell in 1876.
You've gone too far this time.
I believe whatever he says.
Tom asked me which way to go.
That's all I'm trying to do.
That's going to take a while.
He revealed the secret to her.
We think that he's honest.
Progress is unavoidable.
I know exactly who it is.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
His house was struck by lightning.
I need your help.
What made you come here so early?
I have to cover his loss.
Can you tell us what the bank robber looked like?
He was distracted by the beautiful girl.
Let's party.
I'm not as rich as I was.
They were abandoned by their mother.
I really owe you an apology.
I suddenly feel very much alone.
Just then I heard footsteps in the stairwell.
All the other kids do it.
I can't stand it any longer.
I sometimes take a shower in the morning.
Let's go eat together.
I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
We're not so different, you and I.
Have you heard this story already?
I wrote a postcard to Tom.
That umbrella is Tom's.
I'd like to go to the zoo.
The bad smell sickened me.
I know I got it right this time.
That's the reason I bought this book.
I don't think this is the best time to talk to Tom.
I was deeply impressed with his courage.
I don't want to discourage you from doing that.
He is too old.
I must destroy you.
She dumped him for a richer man.
You've been cleared of all charges.
Tell me what time I need to be there.
Please make my bed.
Are you about done?
She wants to kiss him.
Did Tom listen to you?
Who hired you?
I read a book while eating.
Did you go to the last class?
He didn't reply to my letter.
I don't date.
I also heard a similar story.
Are you Catholic?
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
I hate to see you so miserable.
He's much younger than Tom.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
I knew it was unhealthy.
This time it's different.
I want you to promise me something.
He's buying an old hat.
He takes everything lightly.
I'm going to need you.
Do you think that you can beat me?
We discussed the problem at length.
You're opportunistic.
My cat is following me.
We hope to do a good job.
She's looking for a better job.
We're sneaky.
I'll be back by six.
You should do that soon.
Tom is scared to death.
I love your sweater.
I won't risk it.
I've tried everything I know to cheer him up.
That's self-evident.
Who let you come in?
I'm not sure that that's a good thing.
Tom says he wants a puppy for Christmas.
Buy me a drink.
I said some things I wish I didn't.
No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked against us.
The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part.
I showed Tom the postcard I got from Mary.
I hope Tom will get well soon.
I truly do not understand the question.
They all burst out laughing.
Let's go to eat together.
He clearly stated that point.
Of the eight, only one was found guilty.
This is an apple tree.
Stop screaming.
Just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
How much am I paying you?
I must ride a bicycle.
I suggest that we hold off on making a decision until all bids are in.
Who wrote the Bible?
I'll get used to it.
We have friends in common.
I'm just beginning.
Will you please come with me?
Which is mine?
I wish you had come with us.
Don't try my patience.
Your father is quite tall.
You can't handle this alone.
Are you mentally ill?
I'll see you later.
We have to move now.
I got you confused with your oldest brother.
We talked about it all night.
How can you be so callous?
One of his two daughters lives in Tokyo, and the other in Nara.
They enjoyed themselves.
Many trees fell down.
I'm calling the cops.
I was trespassing.
I will gladly help you.
Your story is hard to believe.
She is well known both in Japan and in America.
You can count on him.
I am hungry because I did not eat lunch.
Weather permitting, we will go on a picnic tomorrow.
You don't want this.
I suggest we put on some clean clothes.
We don't have any proof.
If it were not for exams, we would be happy.
See that this never happens again.
Talk to my boss.
I only came to say I'm sorry.
Fortunately, they escaped the danger.
Is there somebody you want to see?
How long does it take to get to the train station?
What was the hotel called? I can't remember.
I was one of the skeptics.
I have a fever and I ache all over.
Your cat will survive.
Tom has decided to do both.
Tom is still in his uniform.
The fire destroyed the tall building.
Here's my email address.
I want you to stay with me.
I like adventures.
I asked you if you wanted some help.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
I don't fight with Tom as much as I used to.
What do you want to do about it?
I'm not the kind to kiss and tell.
You and I are good friends.
Tom doesn't know the whole story.
He will play baseball tomorrow.
She went shopping.
She advised him not to go there by himself.
I should never have stolen that.
I cannot stop the bleeding.
I had to wait twenty minutes for the next bus.
You're silly.
Cookie needs a walk.
I believe that he is a reliable man.
He subscribed to Time magazine.
Japan imports great quantities of crude oil.
I'm sure we'll be able to manage that.
The suspect wanted to avoid being arrested.
What're you looking for?
We're very nervous about that.
It's true!
Come over!
You weren't even there.
Let's not squabble.
This should be done as soon as possible.
The girls are going to be late this evening.
I heard everything you said.
We are late.
You're all done.
Strangely enough, he failed.
I didn't know Tom came from Boston.
He lived an unhappy life.
Turn the page.
She does not smoke.
After losing his job, he went through a very difficult time.
I love you from the bottom of my heart.

I just wanted to see what would happen.
Most were unable to read or write.
Tom said we'd find you here.
Can you tell me what this is?
Where did you get the money?
I've got my pride.
Nobody is forcing you to do this.
I knew you wouldn't do that.
Can you swim?
What're you talking about?
The doorbell is ringing.
The rain changed into snow.
The family moved from their native Germany to Chicago around the year 1830.
Tom ironed his clothes.
He had to stay in hospital for a whole week.
They haven't changed their mind.
Yesterday's vices are tomorrow's customs.
Tom didn't leave a suicide note, so the police suspect murder.
Where's everyone going?
Where did you go fishing?
Why don't you tell me what you remember?
You don't have to know all the details.

He is tall and strong.
It tastes just right.
I hardly slept last night.
The boy fell off the bicycle and fractured his skull.

You would look stupid wearing your mother's dress.
Where did you work before you came here?
We need to get rid of Tom.
There is no school during August.
By the time you come back, I'll be gone.
Take one of these.
What's your diagnosis?
There's not enough food for all of us.
I opened the drawer.
I can't let you do that.
Keep this lesson in mind.
There was a drop in temperature after the rain.
Did that have any special significance?

I found the comic book very interesting.
She married a musician.
I was almost afraid to talk to you.
Don't be upset.
Why are you wearing that?
They should thank me.
They bought quite a few books.
Have you been crying all night? Your eyes are all puffy.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
I thought you had somewhere else to be.
Why didn't you say it like that?
I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
I know that Tom should do that.
I caused this.
I'm practically an expert now.
She taught me how to swim.
My dream is to go to Japan.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
Tom's reply surprised Mary.
It wasn't an accident.
We're your last hope.
I didn't tell that guy my name.
I like talking.
That's just a guess.
God bless you!
Ignorance is bliss.
Tom is voting.
I cannot bear the pain any more.
In two years, the company has more than doubled in size.
There are plenty of nice girls out there.
All my friends turned their back on me.
When they moved to the town, they found it easy to make friends.
Why don't you just study a little harder?
These flowers bloom earlier than others do.
I am here on business.
Out of my way!
What's their purpose?
I wasn't involved.
You owe Tom an apology.
All at once, I heard a cry.
She turned down my offer.
He is now on his own.
Can you get it done before the end of the week?
I love the sound of rain falling.
There were no taxis available.
Now that I have a girlfriend, I'm happy.
These trousers are dirty.
Tom woke up at the crack of dawn.
He's about to leave.
I've given this quite a lot of thought.
I don't think you should've done that.
Unfortunately she already has a steady boyfriend.
I was hurt and upset.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
You should wash your hands before you eat.
I often borrow books from the library.
What did you find?
I couldn't let you do that.
How did you get interested in art?
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
Can you think of anything else?
Tom exaggerates.
The other boys teased him when he got his hair cut.
You have to be prepared for anything.
They live downstairs.
Tom knows where he should be.
I think we should all go outside.
That's why I'm so fat.
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
Tom doesn't seem to be very interested.
Just use mine for now.
They do not know how to do it.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth.
Did you grow up in Boston?
I don't know who you are anymore.
What's your favorite subject?
I must object.
It's obvious that you're wrong.
Despite everything, Tom started to relax.
I'll make some tea.
I was very happy about it.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
Everyone is standing.
She accused me of being a liar.
You should be proud of yourselves.
I'm kidding.
Stop talking loudly.
He was sentenced to death.
That man looks vaguely familiar.
I have not been sick for the past ten years.
I'm driving.
Let's not go.
What'll tomorrow's weather be like?
I wouldn't have sung that song if I'd known it would make Tom cry.
The restaurant is closed.
What did you think I was going to do?
I want you to let me go.
I don't really know.
Give me back the TV remote.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
Please be serious.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
We were obliged to abandon our plan.
This isn't your fault, Tom.
I need you now.
I feel honored.
You must obey the traffic rules.
Everyone looks worried.
I had a bad day today.
I'm going to need your help.
I grew up here.
I'm 25 years old.
He did not come back before ten o'clock.
Tom was writing at his desk when Mary entered the room.
Do you know that hotel?
I know you're going to say no.
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
How long did you stay at the party?
You won't even remember me a few years from now.
He'll rip my head off.
Tom is upstairs in his bedroom.
Tom didn't know how to respond.
I'm not embarrassed.
What're you doing today?
The plane had already taken off when I reached the airport.
I want to talk to your manager.
Why don't you talk to him?
You ought to be quiet in a library.
How is it that you can speak this language?
I cleared the table.
Tom went back to the hotel.
I met a friend while I was waiting for a bus.
This gold is mine.
I know a girl who speaks French very well.
She asked him for some money to buy a new dress.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
My father stopped drinking.
Are you being followed?
You're not the only Canadian here.
I know you see it, but are you really looking at it?
I'm convinced.
Are they in love?
Don't you think it's a bad thing?
I'll give you a day to think about it.
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
It was entirely by chance that I found out what he was doing.
I'm sorry for being late.
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
Call a doctor.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
I know you were born in Boston.
You seem pretty calm about it.
Tom is the best drummer in Boston.
He was shown the photo by her.
A crazy thing just happened to me.
Tom is trying to sell his old car.
No sooner had he arrived than he fell sick.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
My brother gets up every morning at 7.
She advised him to stop smoking.
I used to work in a bank.
Could I see you in private?
I'm upstairs.
My dog often pretends to be asleep.
Are you watching your weight?
He gave a deep sigh.
I can't go out.
Don't even think about it.
She advised him to take a long holiday.
Don't be such a fool.
I learned to read in school.
A sponge absorbs liquids.
I bowed politely.
I don't like the way you're acting.
Tom will be cremated tomorrow.
I want a refund.
Is there a particular way I'm supposed to address you?
That's true enough.
No one knew who I was.
I had a good night's sleep.
You need a joystick.
I heard them coming.
You'll find this book very interesting.
I don't know if I can do this.
I have too many things on my mind these days.
They have nothing left.
What do you make of that?
I mentioned your name to him.
Even if he doesn't come, we'll have to begin.
Did you have a piano lesson that day?
Pus has formed in the wound.
This applies to your case as well.
He wore old shoes.
I'm so happy to see you again.
Don't look into the box.
I bought this coat at a low price.
Please stop.
How do we stop it?
There is no need for us to hurry.
I'm studying in the library.
I think perhaps Tom can help Mary.
Tom came up with an ingenious idea.
Look what I did.
He was cheating.
I'm worried about it.
The dog next door is always barking.
It's awfully cold today.
Tom didn't say anything to me.
You're not impressing me.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The road was blocked by fallen rocks.
We can't add days to our life, but we can add life to our days.
I only speak a smattering of Japanese.
I was still eating when the doorbell rang.
Can I get your attention, please?
I don't want any ice cream.
There is a little water left.
That's lovely.
Will you teach me how to play chess?
The athletic meet was postponed due to rain.
I want to get on with my life.
Tom has money. However, he's not all that happy.
Tom played a sad song on the piano.
This joke is not funny.
His intelligence and experience enabled him to deal with the trouble.
Things are about to get ugly.
Do you know anyone who needs a job?
You're clever.
I put on my trousers.
Everyone working for us earns more than the minimum wage.
I love both of you.
Don't state the obvious.
You may come at any time tomorrow afternoon.
Tom might be right.
I have a friend who can speak French.
Would you please turn on the air conditioner?
What is the main industry in this town?
I'm smarter than you.
I live in a big city.
I made you a surprise.
I took the 10:30 train, which was ten minutes late.
What did you find out?
Are you finished?
I'm not armed.
She works in a bank.
I'm ready for tomorrow.
The number of students is dropping.
I used to play here.
What kind of changes do you want us to make?
Be careful not to drive on the wrong side of the road.
It happens a lot.
It's more dangerous than I thought.
I just stayed quiet.
What flower do you like best?
Tom emigrated to Australia.
I'm running out of closet space.
He is almost always at home.
I left my keys on the table.
She handed him the money that she owed him.
Tom should let Mary know that he likes her.
Tom called Mary Monday evening.
There is a small pond in our garden.
I'm not like other people.
It's not predictable.
I have to hurry!
I'm hoping that I can write two or three songs over the weekend.
Have they responded?
I'm needed here.
She pressured him to quit.
Our little boy is growing up.
Keep the door open.
I'm innocent.
You look fat.
How about stopping the car and taking a rest?
I'm afraid he cannot come.
Keep away from that pond, please.
Is your school in this town?
I did what I had to do.
I looked in my closet for something to wear.
How does it feel to be back?
You'll do exactly as I say.
They said it's OK.
You shouldn't pop your bubble gum in class.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
I knew what you meant.
That pretty girl is my sister.
I can't drink any more beer.
I know you hired a lawyer.
I never want to see you get sick.
Are you free tomorrow?
So what's going on?
Whatever you say.
I realized what was happening.
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
I've never heard such a thing.
What do you hope to find here?
I don't need your permission to do this.
I paid for the drinks.
The train had already left when we got to station.
Tom hardly ever eats dessert.
Don't tell anybody.
There is no breeze here.
Well, Tom, shouldn't we tell Mary?
You're very stylish.
The police are following us.
Let's get in the truck.
What would you like for dessert?
I can't stay for dinner.
I don't remember a thing.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
You'd do the same thing if you were me.
Concerning this, I'm the one to blame.
Have you tried it before?
They all objected to his proposal.
Could you please hurry?
When I was your age, I was already married.
Please ask someone else.
I finished work at six.
Would you consider taking care of my children next Saturday?
Having failed several times, he tried to do it again.
I was born in Osaka, but brought up in Tokyo.
I suppose I've got to get my feet wet sometime.
You nearly died.
Do you like to sing?
She introduced her sister to him.
Nobody was interested.
What Tom told you was a lie.
Is there any more beer?
Go to the store.
Don't try to deny it.
I could help.
She likes her school a lot.
You're going to have to pay for the repair.
We should've stayed with Tom.
My grandson is still a baby.
He was surprised at the sight of blood.
I'm still intimidated by you.
Our lives are in your hands.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
My dad taught me how to do it.
Tom's car is on fire.
There was a list of available candidates.
It was obviously a joke.
Please show me your notebook.
Do you remember anything?
I hope you're not alone.
The floor has just been waxed.
How do you know how heavy it is?
He is a lawyer by profession.
You ran a red light.
I feel stupid.
Do any of you have a pencil?
I think I see something.
I was dismissed.
What are you worrying about?
If you add three to four, you get seven.
My father gave me a lot of money.
Have you ever done any volunteer work?
I worked hard for this money.
What if he should fail?
Tom told me he was really busy.
I don't wear glasses.
He often makes people angry.
How much is it going to cost me?
He won't be home at lunch time.
Isn't this nice?
I want you in my office in one hour.
She kissed my cheek.
Not everyone believed this plan was a good one.
They were busy.
What're you all doing in the library?
We wanted you.
I had a couple of questions, but I didn't ask them.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
Where's the kitchen?
He does a kind act once a day.
You like English, don't you?
A man is more or less what he looks like.
I went home and cried.
I'm going to lock the door.
She had the kindness to help me.
The middle one is mine.
Forgive me.
I have no funds in the bank.
Is it the wrong thing to do?
How do they seem to you?
You're not expecting me to help you, are you?
Do you need to drink wine?
How did you come by this painting?
I just don't believe you.
They kicked him out of the disco without any explanation.
Old people need someone to talk to.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I can't believe you're trying to bribe me.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
Let's sit at the same table.
It's better you don't know.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
Weird things are happening.
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
A gunshot was heard in the distance.
They look confused.
How's your father?
Every crime must be punished.
What do you plan to do?
Do you have something to add?
She listened to him.
Tom hadn't seen Mary in a while.
Wash your face before you go to school.
I'm good at singing.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to go.
That doesn't surprise me.
I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
I wonder if this really works.
It smells delicious.
Where are they now?
My mother has made me what I am today.
I need more light.
We're all wasting time.
I felt my heart pound after running a little.
What a night!
I love you more than you love me.
Rest here for a bit.
Tom shouldn't be allowed to do that.
I showed him the way.
How about playing golf this afternoon?
I told her what to do.
They gathered at a farm in New York State.
He thought up an excuse.
That's not going to change.
She's wearing a nice hat.
I think I can sing that.
I don't think I can keep that promise.
We missed you.
I know you want to make me happy.
Let's change into our swimsuits and go swimming.
He goes to sleep with the lights left on.
I'm one of the thirty people who want to do that.
Is it still raining?
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
You were terrified, weren't you?
An article about our school appeared in the newspaper.
I'll try not to make mistakes next time.
The tour guide can speak three languages.
I don't feel well at all.
You can't go alone.
You've been very kind to me.
It was difficult to remove the coffee stain.
Being an only child, he was the sole heir.
He let us go.
No one was absent except her.
Contact my assistant if you have any questions.
Tom eventually confessed.
I will answer within three days.
He was very naughty when he was a little boy.
Why do you study French?
It gave me the creeps.
Here are our books.
Keep the door closed.
His heart beated slowly.
She herself helped him because no one else would.
It's nearly impossible.
We see each other at the supermarket now and then.
You're going to have to stop doing that.
I never feed my dog raw meat.
He is my brother, not my father.
Tom, look what we did.
There's something happening here that I don't quite understand.
Give it up.
Neither is beautiful.
Mary carries pepper spray in her purse.
You're right, I think.
When I last saw him, he was wearing a blue shirt and white slacks.
Push the door open.
She's awesome.
I have nothing else.
She took part in the contest.
Life without love is just totally pointless.
They really slept on the floor.
I asked Tom if he would go, too.
I can't explain why it happened.
I thought people were exaggerating.
Few students could understand what he said.
She was at a loss for words to express her feeling.
You have to live with it.
Do you have any small change?
My heart wasn't in the work.
I'll trust you.
We are pretty much in agreement.
Say that again.
I'd love to see Tom win.
Used car salesmen are a disreputable bunch.
The most valuable skill one can acquire is the ability to think for oneself.
Please give this pen to me.
How could you say such a thing?
I thought I heard music.
I saw a little boy running.
To my surprise, she was alive.
Her son is a genius.
Don't ask me for forgiveness. What's been done has been done.
Tom forgot his trumpet at school.
Draw me a sheep.
Do you want a drink or not?
Can anyone confirm your story?
I was stung by a bee.
Everybody is equal before the law.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
I have heartburn.
We have to postpone our departure.
They ate and drank wine.
They probably don't know.
This must be my lucky day.
She just left.
I am sure of his honesty.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
How can I contact Tom?
You don't know how lucky you are.
What time did you wake up?
Come home at once.
Let's clean our room.
Tom was pacing in his room, unable to calm himself down.
Do you like English?
Does that mean you won't come?
Tom is making soup.
Is it a compliment or an insult?
We'll work the problem out.
How much did you bring?
She's a model.
You've got to move.
Stand up when I'm talking to you!
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
I'll give you a lift home.
Tom didn't have a lot to say.
I cry every day.
You don't have to go.
There's no way out.
These books belong to me.
I already did that.
It's starting to grow on us.
We're running a little late.
Would you mind if I ate a piece of this pie?
Don't bother me with such trifles.
You can't just not show up.
I have to run.
When I got back, I found my car missing.
Where can I park my car?
If I help you, will you help me?
She put on her sister's jeans and looked in the mirror.
Many TV programs have a bad influence on children.
Does it snow a lot in the winter?
Do you want to wear my jacket?
I remember seeing you somewhere.
I know how busy you are.
I know him by name.
How can you be so sure?
I'm leaving on Sunday.
You're sitting in my chair.
So, why are you here?
That gave Tom an idea.
Are you children all right?
I wonder what happened.
This storm is not dangerous. You don't need to worry.
She can speak Japanese.
My children live in Boston.
I didn't mean that literally.
Leave me alone.
My daughter is barely fifteen.
I want to know who told you that.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
That's possible.
Well then, we still have a problem.
I'll give you this camera.
Tom didn't want to sing.
I beg to differ.
Unless you hurry, you will be late for school.
I can't drink this stuff.
Tom went to a nearby convenience store to buy something to eat.
I am impressed by your recent advertisement in the New York Times.
I'm pleased to see you.
It can be confusing at first.
I don't drink.
I've been promoted.
Can't you see I'm busy?
He's stronger than you.
Don't even bother coming.
Giving advice to him is like talking to a brick wall.
Don't expect too much of me.
Fish can be dry and tasteless if it's overcooked.
Was there a scandal?
He hit his head on the shelf.
It's not what you wear, it's how you wear it.
He studied hard in order to get into college.
The dog followed me to my home.
This is an order.
I know that Tom is a genius.
The tea is too strong. Add some water.
I explained the process to him.
I have a little something for you.
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
I delivered a lecture in English.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world.
He denies himself nothing.
She can't find her hat.
I just don't want any of these.
Do you know where my watch is?
I didn't expect you.
Let's see what the outcome is.
The girls won.
No wonder he was arrested.
The bottle is full.
This water isn't drinkable.
Why do you interrupt me all the time?
I like women.
This one is ours.
We are going to have a party on Saturday night.
What's this book about?
He speaks French.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
You're not alone anymore.
I think that French grammar is difficult.
Thank you very much.
I have to study for a biology test.
Why did you come home so late?
You don't have to come.
Was that all you wanted to say to me?
I can make it to my class on time, he thought.
They had no alternative energy sources.
I feel so happy when I'm with you.
They want to increase food production by growing new kinds of rice.
Where do you go on Monday evenings?
Tears rolled down my cheeks.
Tom was upstairs.
Nobody goes outside in this kind of weather.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I'd have waited for you.
I'm open to suggestions.
I will be glad to help you anytime.
I love all of you.
I didn't consider the subject seriously.
I made a complete fool of myself.
The game got more and more exciting.
I've warned you before about this.
Is Tom studying French?
I bought the book.
I know that Tom is a rookie.
Don't do that to me.
I really do love your tie.
I'm catching on.
You're the oldest.
Tom and I are both waiting for Mary.
I anticipated trouble.
I don't have any trouble believing that.
We saw the parade move down the street.
Tom failed to pass his driving test.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I don't see a horse, but I see a wolf.
What do you want the message to be?
This river is deepest here.
I want to come and live here.
I don't share your optimism.
I heard that he'd died.
The soldiers resisted the enemy attack.
You're not the first.
We're getting close.
I still need to talk to you.
Hand me the hammer, will you?
I don't worry about that kind of stuff.
Let me push the button.
A bad writer's prose is full of hackneyed phrases.
This wasn't your fault.
Let me take this one.
When's that supposed to happen?
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
Isn't there something we can do?
That's disturbing.
Everyone has their own strong and weak points.
I saw her clean the room.
Tom is always watching TV.
I quite agree with you.
What do you expect us to do?
I'm very impressed.
I know you haven't done it yet.
This is the restaurant where we had dinner last week.
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
I called my mother up from the station.
You're my boss.
He took a short cut.
I hope you're well.
Are we lost?
Good morning.
I did everything I could do.
You can count on Tom.
Wait for Tom.
Tom was about to kiss Mary when her father walked into the room.
Which horse did you bet on?
I won't let you ruin this.
This hat is too big for you.
My friends scolded me for my stupid behavior.
Do you have a bottle opener I could use?
I'll bring lunch.
I'll teach you how to sing.
It's not mine.
I was in the hospital last week.
How do you want me to handle that?
He doesn't resemble either of his parents.
I came to talk to you about Tom.
I go to Osaka by bus.
How much time did we lose?
I thought you might be upset.
I was too fast.
You have as much right as everyone else.
Beer's good.
I don't think this is a good idea.
What a pretty girl!
Many of my friends can speak French.
Don't you drag me into this.
You all did good work.
I must learn Japanese.
I asked Tom to stop doing that.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
That'll be a lot of fun.
I was watching videos.
I'm looking for my dog.
Are you writing a letter?
We became Americanized after World War II.
I like the way you walk.
What would cause that?
What else would you like to eat?
You've turned up at the right moment.
Why don't you come visit us?
Will he ever change?
You must go outside if you want to smoke.
Someone turned the alarm off.
Please show me another one.
She didn't want to sell the book.
What do you want to say?
Tom made a list of songs he doesn't like.
That gives me an idea.
This sword has a strange history.
How do we upload photos to your website?
You haven't given me what I asked for.
I am a stranger here.
How did you come by this painting?
You're disappointed, aren't you?
This plant is good to eat.
He is in the bathroom.
Did you see the eclipse yesterday?
They can't hear you.
He is precious to us.
Only those who risk going too far will know how far one can go.
He has hardly any money, but he gets by.
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
That's avoidable.
He regrets his mistake.
I already sold that.
You must help your mother.
What is the origin of the universe?
She advised him not to drive too fast, but he wouldn't listen to her.
You're quite attractive.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
I have good news in store for you.
In autumn, leaves change color and fall.
He has the ability to do the job.
You need to be more careful from now on.
We want to negotiate.
You're unambitious.
That's against the rules.
You knew that already, didn't you?
I know Tom isn't a wise man.
The pilot explained to us why the landing was delayed.
Tom called customer service.
It'll be too late then.
It really breaks my heart.
This gives me the strength to go on.
We need you back in the office.
I think you panicked.
I learned a valuable lesson today.
I was scratched by a cat.
Why don't you read it for yourself?
Tom is Mary's stepson.
What are they complaining about?
You can go to the station by bus.
I don't feel tired at all.
Just get back to work.
I didn't ask for this.
The college accepted him as a student.
I'm sorry for calling so late. I just wanted to hear your voice.
I basically like your plan.
Where is it hidden?
How did you learn Esperanto?
How can you criticize that?
I never speak French anymore.
This is something I must face alone.
I'll get you another lawyer.
I never blamed you.
Could you help me wash the dishes?
Mary took out a loan in order to pay her debts.
I think Tom will eat later.
They incited him to commit the crime.
Tom followed the guidelines.
Are you still scared?
You've been selected.
It is necessary for you to study harder.
Thanks for the invitation, Tom.
I just want you out of my house.
I agree with you 100%.
Do Japanese people eat sushi every day?
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
I really do hope we can still be friends.
I think your hypothesis is correct.
She refuses to say more about it.
I don't know how to explain it.
Since this is your neck of the woods, maybe you can tell us where to find a good pizza joint.
I can hear Tom singing.
Doing that sort of thing makes you look stupid.
She told me she loved me.
I don't know what's best for me.
I want to hold you.
You've got a crush on this girl. "No, I don't!"
You said you were busy.
This guy's great at pitching curveballs.
A lot can happen in a year.
I'm feeling low.
I suggest that you go and see a doctor about this as soon as you can.
He promised me that he wouldn't tell anybody.
Are you going to Tom's party?
It was very stressful.
When did you start learning German?
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
I've run short of money.
How dare you speak to me like that!
Don't you miss your father?
I carefully took down everything that my teacher said.
Was the movie interesting?
I don't like who you've become.
I'm happy to see you.
Which dog is yours?
That's all I should say.
You should be used to this by now.
He must have entered this room.
It's easier this way.
The workers took pride in their work.
Talk to me.
I've tried them all.
Since I couldn't pay the rent, I asked him for help.
Why did you change your mind?
It doesn't make any sense.
We meet once a month.
All beginnings are difficult.
Have you told everyone when and where the meeting will be?
Thanks for bringing me up to date on this matter.
Maria Callas was a famous opera singer.
I was expecting you at 11:00 a.m.
You should begin with easier questions.
Tom bought one for himself.
What woke you up?
How long were you gone?
I helped her with her work.
Both of you are wrong.
Spending time with your family should be your priority.
Keep your hands to yourself.
The post office isn't too far from here.
Are you saying that you don't want to see me anymore?
Nobody's perfect.
Tom wants to know more about Mary's past.
Tom is plotting something.
I was scared, of course.
I want you to wear this one.
We'll be working on that this week.
Stop that!
It was just 6 years ago that I visited New Zealand for the first time.
We're lost.
Since it was so hot, we went swimming.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is trying to do.
I was trying to talk to you.
He has no girlfriend.
Are you sure we have enough beer?
She refuses to say more about it.
She sat at the bar downing shot after shot of whisky.
There are five patients in the waiting room.
Do you need a hand with your suitcases?
Are you happy right now?
She is married to an American.
I'd like a word with you in private.
I am running short of money.
I'm sorry to disturb you while you're talking.
That's what you get for not listening.
I had no clue.
I apologize if I offended you.
People have the right to defend themselves.
I'm going to be late for the meeting.
Have you asked if they want one?
I was so disappointed.
Does Tom like swimming?
Are you happy?
She broke into tears.
Add a little more milk to my tea, please.
This is an abomination.
Many people like to travel.
I let the cat out of the house.
Come home before it gets dark.
I talk to myself.
The shortage of manpower poses a big problem for us.
Can you see?
I'm afraid of flying.
I came here to meet you.
Someone should notify the next of kin.
The apples are not quite ripe.
He's a salesman too.
I don't have much longer.
I guess I'm spoiled.
Could we have a table near the window?
Take hold of the rope.
You're the oldest.
You're cheating.
You have something of a reputation.
They work in the fields.
I can't believe you're considering doing that.
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?
I brushed my hair.
He liked that.
They didn't swim because it was cold.
There's a woman in the room.
I know you did it on purpose.
I feel comfortable.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
That's the whole story.
Tom has accepted our invitation.
She works with single-minded determination.
Is it far?
He went shopping.
As you requested, I have attached a recent passport-sized photograph.
I love talking to you.
Maybe you're right.
It's awful.
My room faces east.
We talked about time zones.
I admit I did what Tom told me not to do.
I got it for free.
Small enterprises are feeling the squeeze of inflation.
Tom won three races.
You must be a good cook.
He is an intelligent boy.
What do you want it for?
I need to earn more money.
I ran all the way home.
I advised Tom not to do that.
Is your daughter here?
We never went anywhere when I was a kid.
Don't drink so much beer.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom amazes me at times.
He promised me that he would come at four.
They won't get past me.
I had no idea you were so stupid.
This news is official.
I stood.
She celebrated her fifteenth birthday yesterday.
I really am glad you're here.
Much better to be woken by the birds than by an alarm.
I'm pleased with their performance.
I hope your wish will come true.
Your dress is touching the wet paint.
I can't do this anymore.
Do you think Tom would consider dating my younger sister?
Why are you always complaining?
I'm sensitive.
He lived to be eighty years old.
I paid nothing.
I thought you'd be pleased.
It was quite dark when I got home.
I don't want to know what you did yesterday.
He is too busy dreaming dreams to plan what he will do in his old age.
Can I make you a drink?
I didn't think you'd leave so early.
I don't think her story is true.
I'm not the guy you want making this decision.
Why does everybody think that?
Tom is obsessed with power and money.
I don't know whether it is true or not.
Fill it up.
Tom's car has tinted windows.
He worked day and night so that his family could live in comfort.
I bought a pair of scissors.
I'm so happy for you, Tom.
Are you injured?
I think you're lying.
She forgave him for losing all her money.
Are you deaf?
It seems interesting to me.
We're not home right now.
He chose a good wife.
He wanted to buy the book.
I'm not good-looking.
I can't allow this.
We're sinking.
Tom turned off the engine and shut off the headlights.
I didn't say you were crazy.
Why don't we go somewhere together?
I closed the book.
Let me introduce you to a good dentist.
I'll keep it with me.
I really enjoy spending time with you.
Are you trying to tell me something?
I'm going to the bank.
I didn't want to be presumptuous.
I always root for the underdog.
They want you dead.
My colleague filled in for me while I was sick.
What are we all doing?
Are you nervous?
Where did you grow up?
Aren't you too young to smoke?
I suppose you want me to pay for this.
It would be a good idea if I went.
You're too young to remember the nineties.
It's fun to watch the race.
My brother gave me a cute doll.
This site is quite useful.
The teacher explained the meaning of the word to us.
He was very hurt by her cruel words.
I couldn't eat fish when I was a child.
Tom stutters.
Tom made a surprising decision.
Is she making a doll?
I think Tom knows what he's doing.
They'll be all right.
I think you must be tired.
Wait until you see this.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
We have a few surprises in store for her.
She got no answer from him.
He left the motor running.
Are you productive?
He can read well.
I advise you to change clothes.
You have a great job.
She married a rich man.
I wish I could see you.
Tom must be wrong.
I respect you.
Are you resourceful?
It was quite pleasant.
He wiped his hands on a handkerchief.
You're conceited.
They should've known that this would happen.
Better a little than nothing.
We can't keep doing this.
Close the window.
Your plan is a good one, but mine is a better one.
You have a choice of black tea, coffee, or milk.
This is a dead-end street.
The only difference between a bad cook and a poisoner is the intent.
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
This girl is driving me crazy.
They all looked relieved.
The engine's starting to overheat.
Which bed do you want to use?
I read it to my family.
No one wants to go there.
How old were you when you got married?
Pass me the salt.
Aren't you supposed to be at work?
I woke up at sunrise.
You probably wouldn't understand this.
You're so pathetic.
Bears are quite dangerous.
I wouldn't be so sure.
That chicken hasn't laid any eggs lately.
What are you doing to stop this?
He bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I just don't buy it.
This bicycle belongs to me.
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
I will have finished the work before you return.
Your feet will lead you to where your heart is.
It's not right.
That's what I figured.
Catch you later.
She has no brothers.
That's all I do.
She writes to her son every so often.
Fish cannot live out of water.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
You are in part responsible for it.
Tom is an intern.
Do you have some money?
Everyone admires the pictures painted by him.
We gave a party in celebration of his 70th birthday.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
He said it was out of the question.
Where did the bee sting you?
I'll be upstairs if you need me.
I'd be depressed if they asked me to quit the team.
Just do your job.
Do you want some hot chocolate?
We pitched the tent next to the river.
The world is changing more and more quickly.
Tom boiled some water.
I'm pretty sure Tom has already gone home.
I'm waiting for my friend.
There is a big hole in your stocking.
I really don't understand why you think that's a good idea.
You'd better go. It's getting late.
This time, I think you're right.
What does it contain?
I'm reluctant to help Tom.
What do you call this bird?
I didn't know who he was.
You gave me hope.
The tire leaks air.
Were you going to the train station when I saw you?
I'm not sure when he'll come.
They're all safe.
I've just talked to Tom about that matter.
Both teams are unbeaten.
Somebody saw you.
I know Tom is a journalist.
Could you read this for me?
Tom knew that he wouldn't be punished.
I'm really happy for you.
I don't need this anymore.
He explained the matter in detail.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
That looks kind of fun.
Do you have the vaccine?
I don't like your taste in colors.
There's one thing I must tell you.
What would cause this?
I thought Tom was your friend.
Did I show you this?
I object to being treated like a child.
Do you want this done quickly or do you want this done right?
Have you got a match?
We must start at the beginning.
Who did you write a letter to?
I was left behind.
I know Tom isn't guilty.
My dress was ruined when it came back from the cleaner's.
The rain prevented him from coming here.
Who's the photographer?
How beautiful this flower is!
We're not going to make a decision overnight.
What should we do if he happens to come late?
You're boring.
What more is there to know?
I know Tom and Mary are poor.
Tom is level-headed.
What would you like to do today?
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
Tom didn't want me to touch him.
That's all you get.
I don't care about your past.
He was sitting in the library when I saw him.
Put it in the closet.
We respect them.
You're no different.
Do you have a ticket?
I saw you outside.
I spent a great deal of time dealing with that problem last week.
Was that you I heard singing in the shower?
Are we in the same hotel?
I will testify.
She thanked him for his help.
I wonder what it could be.
That's why no one wants to work with you.
He drank a whole bottle of milk.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Your skirt's on backwards.
They did not listen.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
A dog was run over by a truck.
Clear off the table.
You don't know the system.
You drank a beer at lunch, didn't you?
This area is off-limits.
We need to get it done before tomorrow.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
I don't know what to do now.
Do you like my new haircut?
I'd rather walk than take a bus.
This is the hardest question.
Do you have a blog?
What a terrible mistake!
We don't have a whole lot of time.
We know what the problem is.
You must not take advantage of her innocence.
The time has come when I must tell you the truth.
Is there a school bus?
She laced her shoes.
Let's get together the next time you come back to Boston.
He asked me for money.
You're very timid.
I could use some sleep.
Night is when most people go to bed.
Tom knows Mary is right.
I'll be in the truck.
I thought I recognized you.
Her speech was excellent.
Look out for pickpockets.
I appreciate your kindness.
I always have a good supply of tissues in my pockets.
He invited me to his house.
Good afternoon.
I have just what you need.
Tom has to brush his teeth.
There's no entertainment in the countryside.
I'm looking forward to seeing you in October.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
Why are you so busy all the time?
We heard a gunshot.
Stay with us.
I didn't want Tom to think I was stupid.
Tom behaved unprofessionally.
Do you have any idea who did this?
He's a filthy liar.
A bear will not touch a dead body.
She allowed him to go alone.
Please give me some water.
I'm your friend.
That's a nice story.
She has been looking after her sick sister for ten years.
Could I have some more tea?
My father is a good speaker of English.
Look at that red building.
I disagree with you on this.
If there's anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to let me know.
Thanks for coming.
You shouldn't make fun of Tom.
He stole her watch.
Please read after me.
So what are you talking about?
There's nothing funny about that.
It's for you to decide.
Kyoto is worth visiting once.
Why were you so slow?
Switch on the light. I can't see anything.
This food does not agree with me.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
Will you join us for a swim?
We live in the United States.
Give me the car key, please.
He has a headache.
There is a lady downstairs who wants to speak to you.
It was just a coincidence.
I'm not going to answer that question.
Everything is on schedule.
You don't want much, do you?
If it had not been for your advice, I could not have succeeded.
He's in the shower.
Tom is perfect for you.
Business expenses are tax-deductible.
Show me another watch.
I had a good time tonight.
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
I want you to be prepared.
I find you irresistible.
It's healthy to breathe deeply.
I don't want to tell him.
Why don't you sing?
Tom looked back.
Do you use aftershave?
You're up to something.
It's not quite ready yet.
Which one of those is yours?
I didn't know what to say to him.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
A picture of the fugitive was plastered all over the newspapers.
He met his wife online.
How can this be possible?
Do you know something I don't know?
She died of stomach cancer.
She betrayed you.
It is strange that he should say so.
Did you plant pumpkins this year?
You've lost some weight, haven't you?
My mother cooks well.
It is not polite to point at others.
He runs.
Dolphins are really smart.
We're home early.
Ants work hard all summer.
I want to make you happy.
I'd like to see your ticket, please.
We adopted an alternative method.
He has gone too far.
Tom is my husband's best friend.
Put the following sentences into Japanese.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
I have orders.
You can't be sure of that.
It has been raining off and on.
These are gifts for my friends.
I have to go to the bathroom.
We have a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
You have a lovely daughter.
I just like to daydream.
Is there anything to drink in the refrigerator?
Wait one second.
He seems angry.
I think that you're wrong.
Let's discuss these problems one at a time.
Someday I'll run like the wind.
This kind of mistake is easy to overlook.
I think this is a bad idea.
Tom certainly had a lot of time to think about it.
Tom couldn't suppress his anger.
Maybe it was obvious.
You're very clever.
Are you sure everyone's already left?
You probably need a drink.
I hate politics.
Tom would be jealous.
Don't give up on your dreams.
Was that you in the car?
She has gone shopping.
Is there space for one more person?
I want that information as soon as possible.
It was unlocked.
He has a remarkable memory.
So, what is it you want me to say?
It's time for bed.
Right now they're all sleeping.
I've just found out who you are.
You don't fool me, you know.
I wish I were as smart as you are.
Your name was dropped from the list.
I've had a slight sore throat since this morning. I wonder if I've caught a cold.
Seeing that it is 8 o'clock, I think you should leave for school soon.
Tom was a blackmailer.
I won't attend the party.
He smoked as if nothing had happened.
The party was held on May 22nd.
It's the only one there is in the shop.
The returning soldiers were commended for their bravery in battle.
I didn't have time to read.
Tom won't be staying long.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
What do you have to say about that?
He asked a favor of me.
Would you do that if you had the chance?
I don't think she can speak French.
It is impossible to do it.
Tom is quite capable of looking after himself.
I'll give you something for the pain.
This is a beautiful house.
Is there something wrong with me?
Sorry, but I want to tell her this news face to face.
You are so childish sometimes.
I almost never met her.
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
Everyone is happy.
Mother has been sick since last Thursday.
Everyone knows me.
She's sitting in the kitchen and drinking tea.
Father is out, but Mother is at home.
This is the tallest tower in Japan.
We like him.
I don't know much about Australia.
Everybody thought so.
She spoke to me in Spanish.
I had no chance to relax there.
Tom knew he was being watched.
Just try it out.
The children love listening to fairy tales.
I have something you want.
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
I didn't see your car outside.
I have made up my mind to propose to her.
She was wearing a strange hat.
The farmer seeded the field with wheat.
I'm going to wear these shoes on our date tonight.
This tea is too bitter.
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
A slip of the tongue often brings about unexpected results.
Are you allergic to any medicines?
I'm leaving now.
I need some cash.
I want to know everything.
They're tired.
She advised him to give up smoking, but he wouldn't listen to her.
A new student came into the class.
I think I ate a little too much today.
We can try it.
You must know Tom pretty well.
If you go near a camel, you risk being bitten.
They know what happened.
You can't go right now.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
They have families.
The fog soon blurred out the figure of a man walking in front of him.
I have many talents.
Your driver's license has expired.
How much more suffering can they endure?
It wasn't me. It was the cat.
She introduced her sister to him.
That suits me.
Let's see if we can find out what the matter is.
The boy next door fell head first from a tree.
Tom set the bird free.
Were you with anyone?
It's got to be now.
I'm out of practice.
Are you ready for Christmas?
You're sleepy.
Tom is getting worried.
Did I embarrass you?
Tom was mauled by a dog when he was a kid.
I have the feeling there's something you haven't told me yet.
I was careful to not leave any evidence.
What are you doing at school this afternoon?
This must be for you.
Tom has to go home.
It's fun to learn about foreign cultures.
They didn't keep their promise.
A secure income is an important thing for me.
This room is too big.
I need to be prepared.
Suddenly, the light went out.
How do you know that you don't need a bodyguard?
May I take a rest?
Your answer is wrong.
It is good for your health to take a walk every morning.
He left in the blink of an eye.
I searched for the meaning of this word in the dictionary.
He collected a lot of stamps.
You're safe here.
He drove to school.
Put your mask on.
Give these to Tom.
You don't have a choice.
I need a breather.
I think that's a possibility.
I didn't care.
My family is small.
Stay awake.
This is a great victory.
Everyone sang.
He studied hard.
Tom already knows this.
I was wondering if I could take a vacation next week.
Today, we are going dancing.
Don't come into my room.
The road is straight for over ten miles.
What are you talking about?
I don't want to go with you.
You should stick those pictures in your album.
Tom isn't busy right now.
Do you mind if I tag along?
She is working hard this semester.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
It's late, so turn off the TV.
I want your love.
It's way too heavy.
The Murais have been married for ten years.
Children don't always listen to their parents.
I like the way she laughs at my jokes.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
I'm the one who's sick.
A button came off my coat.
Her father is Japanese.
It's my fault, not yours.
Do you feel giving gifts is important?
I do things in my own way.
Who's your favorite super hero?
I don't believe in astrology.
You can't leave me now.
He went down the hill.
I don't have a favorite song.
She is his real mother.
Like father, like son.
I heard that Tom kissed Mary.
It's funny.
We have had few typhoons this autumn.
You're totally right.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
I thought I saw something.
I thought that you'd understand.
Is this fake?
He excused himself for his bad behavior.
I'm not even a little hungry.
Were you shot?
If it had not been for your raincoat, I would have been drenched to the skin.
They were in the shower.
Tom is better than me at math.
They look cool.
Mary is Tom's wife.
I must give Tom that.
What did you do then?
We can't be sure about that, can we?
Make up your mind.
Do you think it was easy for me?
I thought you should know.
It's all wet.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
You are not a coward.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
I've never been the kind of person who complains about things like that.
Tom is standing over there near the fireplace.
I'm going to be late.
Tom and Mary are new here.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
I can understand him perfectly.
Tom told Mary that he had a new girlfriend.
We leave for Australia on Monday.
I don't like looking foolish.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Tom cried for help, but nobody heard him.
Call her tomorrow.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
Repetition helps you remember something.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
He kicked his shoes off without untying them first.
He wasn't happy in spite of all his wealth.
I knew Tom personally.
The court found him guilty.
It's a huge problem.
The walls were bare.
We finally have you where we want you.
My bedroom is crawling with spiders.
I returned to my hometown after five years' absence.
Don't be scared.
Run for it!
I've forgotten my email address.
I went to your school.
I wish you'd trust me.
I feel safer here.
That's a depressing story.
He is afraid of swimming.
You look bored.
He often eats fish for dinner.
I asked Tom for his keys.
It's almost the end of the year.
Tom isn't a bad boy.
I laughed out loud.
You're very good.
I've never used a hacksaw before. Could you show me how?
I see your house.
Did I tell you about my party this Friday?
The day we arrived was a holiday.
You can't be a lawyer.
It's useless to try.
This coat fits you.
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
I'm getting tired. It's your turn to drive.
The plan has worked well.
Monday will be a rainy day.
Don't you want everything to be perfect?
You can't buy anything interesting in this store.
I think Tom slept here.
Where did you learn to cook like this?
I saw him walking around town wearing his Sunday best.
I bought a pen, but I lost it.
She married a hotshot lawyer from New York.
Something went terribly wrong.
Every student who has graduated from our university has studied English with a native speaker for at least two years.
Tom showed me how to do it.
I just don't want anybody to get hurt.
Your thirty minutes are up.
You're a filthy liar!
I object to her going there alone.
I think we made the right call.
Is this sterling silver?
Would you like a cup of milk?
You didn't tell me everything.
They all have kids.
Tom has been hammering all day.
She was completely nonplussed by his unexpected behavior.
I cringed.
I don't have time to make you a sandwich.
You may injure yourself if you don't follow safety procedures.
It'll be nice to see everyone again.
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
You're fair.
Help yourself to the strawberry jam.
You owe me one.
He licked his fingers.
He saved me from danger.
I dried my face.
Are you ready to go?
I was surprised by what I learned.
She lost her memory in a traffic accident.
Tom slipped and nearly fell.
Why are you upset?
They guaranteed regular employment to their workers.
Tom said that he liked me.
You made the same mistake.
I'm told you're a good teacher.
I'd rather do this by myself.
We both competed.
Do you really think you can do that?
I bathe every day.
I shouldn't have tried doing that by myself.
They left the room one by one.
They don't talk at all.
If I were you, I wouldn't do it.
I met him at the station.
I thought you'd say that.
You need to eat something before you go to work.
Tom was executed in 2013.
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
Use this.
France is in western Europe.
I have an important meeting I have to go to this afternoon.
Tom spends too much time on the computer.
I didn't know you were awake.
They're dying.
I had to do this today.
Natto smells awful, but tastes delicious.
Have you ever visited Rome?
She was perfect.
Do you need me to repeat the question?
Who's at the wheel?
There is nothing to fear.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
I'm not particularly impressed.
Tom doesn't want to take a walk now.
I simply wanted to see what was going on.
Both Tom and Mary were fired.
You need a ride?
Why don't you answer?
All share the blame.
You should go out and have some fun.
Is it hard to learn French?
I have to apologize.
We're conscientious.
My father has been out of work for a year.
How will you pay your debts?
I wish you success in your work.
The government has imposed a new tax on wine.
Everyone's shocked.
I can't blame you. It was my fault.
What a dope!
He was surprised to find the great artist's masterpiece hung on the wall upside down.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
She didn't want him to die.
If everything goes according to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
You'll want to look your best tomorrow.
Why is everything so difficult?
How many brothers do you have?
I didn't say you did that.
We do need your advice.
If my wife calls, just tell her I'm in an important meeting and cannot be disturbed.
I generally agree with her.
What's the real reason you're here?
I do think it's possible.
Do you want me to call back?
You'll find the book in the library.
I slammed the door.
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm going to be a teacher.
I told you to stay away from my daughter.
He is unsatisfied with the result.
He is sitting on the chair.
Where did you go fishing?
Can you please tell me where the nearest public telephone is?
I'm dizzy.
That would not be easy.
I'd be happy to sing for you.
My girlfriend is crying.
I'm going to put them in a room and let them battle it out.
It is becoming important for us to know how to use a computer.
Try to calm down.
He commanded me to shut the gate.
I've got real feelings for you.
I am ready to do anything for you.
How do you do this?
I don't speak German.
They asked him.
Let's have a good time.
It's convenient living so close to the station.
He doesn't go to the office on Saturday.
Juggling is another thing I'm not very good at.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
That was cool.
I don't like any of these pictures.
She was heard to cry for help.
I'll meet you down at the station tomorrow.
How do you do that?
They agreed to start early.
Tom didn't want to do that either.
Are you sure that's necessary?
When will you be back? "It all depends on the weather."
Can I continue my trip?
My suit is gray.
I'd heard you'd changed.
Do you think there's a connection?
That happened in October.
Tom and Mary look nice.
Tom has the necessary experience.
You don't know what you're talking about.
We want to have a large family.
Tom poured himself a drink.
I relied on his kindness.
He bought her a sweater.
Are you writing a letter?
It is up to you to decide what to do.
The tie doesn't go with my suit.
How old were you when you learned to swim?
Among the items found in the purse was the photo of a man.
She couldn't convince him to ride a horse.
I have a friend whose father is a lawyer.
Is Tom hurt?
We're experienced.
I can't tell what it is.
He hugged her.
Almost all the leaves have fallen.
Please accept this little gift.
They're drunk.
I want to spend more time alone with you.
My father was, I think, a little drunk then.
He knows almost nothing about that animal.
I hope no one saw me dancing.
We're not your enemy.
That brings up another point I'd like to discuss.
Avoid crossing this street when it is raining.
Is it your bike?
I liked that book.
My battery is almost dead.
What time did you arrive there?
We love you so much.
I feel lonely.
He has been warned on several occasions.
You should take better care of yourself.
Tom isn't doing anything.
You are blinded by love.
Was anybody in there?
He had the good fortune to find a good wife.
Tom drives.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
I think you panicked.
I hope we achieve that.
Why didn't you eat lunch today?
A dreary landscape spread out for miles in all directions.
Do you love Tom?
Jorge can speak four languages.
It was too soft.
I followed all the rules.
I want to tell you.
Tom said that he would buy it.
I'm not a drug addict.
Everyone's out.
She can't play piano very well.
Pick a weapon.
Between you and me, I think our boss is stupid.
I think that he's probably not a bad boy.
He fixed the problem in a jiffy.
Not knowing what to do, I did nothing.
Men are pigs.
You always say that.
What else?
Everyone will be happy.
A river flows through the valley.
I feel silly.
We need to talk about this.
Go straight down the road, and when you pass the traffic light you're there.
Why are you following me?
We're wasting water.
He was standing at the door.
Tom had his wallet stolen while he was in Boston.
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
I'm here to protect you.
Take care of this.
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
Tom is asleep in his chair.
What would you do without me?
How many suicides do you think there are every year in Japan?
Who's coming with me?
He's not very good at it.
Staying at home is boring.
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him.
May I set the table?
Tom fired Mary.
You should look this word up.
I'm a respectable businessman.
He got off the train.
He wants you to come home.
I finally escaped.
Please say hello to your parents for me.
We need to band together to beat the enemy.
Are you sure that's necessary?
I guess you never learned how to do this.
This isn't funny.
I want to get a haircut before I go on the trip.
He does not wear a hat.
Tom never did it again.
Were you nervous during the job interview?
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
We both competed.
I want to make sure you're going to be all right.
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.
All of us like you very much.
Listen to this!
I couldn't stand it any longer.
He was invited.
Be friendly.
What makes it so unique?
I'm not going to go to Boston next week.
Black cats are bad luck.
I saw what you did.
What time can you come?
The movie was a whopping success.
Everyone is welcome to participate.
Don't you have anything to do?
Tom hasn't been married long.
You made a bargain with us.
He lives in Nagasaki.
You're the engineer.
I'm glad we didn't do that.
Is it worth spending time trying to help people who don't want to be helped?
I'll accept your offer.
You are unbelievably naive.
He saved us all.
I used to live near a park.
I looked in my closet for something to wear.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Would you put out the candles?
Teach me how you do that.
She especially likes music.
I was canned.
I was fortunate to find a good job.
Please sit still.
Tom said that he was alone.
She played the piano beautifully.
She cooked us a delicious dinner.
It looks like we're in for some nasty weather.
Write me if you need help.
I'll eat standing up.
I want to stop this rumor before it goes any further.
Which is your target?
Tom drank my apple juice.
Sweet dreams!
Tom wants you to go to Boston with him.
She played the violin.
I'll be there at six.
I'd like to speak to your manager.
A book can be compared to a friend.
Let me tell you my side of the story.
He handed in his paper.
The meeting was called off.
What time do you usually eat breakfast?
You're not even close to the right answer.
Did you enjoy your run?
Do you want to try this?
Prizes will be awarded at the end of the contest.
I need more information on this matter.
I came to see Tom.
I received your letter yesterday.
Health is better than wealth.
The boat can still be seen.
Planes are expensive.
Just ignore it.
I opened the trunk.
Why do you want to dress like that?
I did what I was told.
I would like to come and see you.
The river flooded the whole region.
You are a good student.
During the night, everything looks different.
I am glad to accept your invitation.
I won't be quiet.
You can eat all you want.
Tom rarely wears dark colors.
Put on your hat.
He can't afford a new car.
It's strange that our friends are not here.
I am from Shizuoka.
Are you sure they can do this?
How can I solve this problem?
I know Tom is troubled.
They are in the teachers' room.
If you'd asked me, I'd have told you.
I don't know.
We were both wrong.
I think that Tom went to the supermarket yesterday, but I'm not sure.
Do you work here?
What are you reading?
Some of what Tom said was true.
I never leave on vacation without first cleaning my apartment.
He said he did not know the man, which was a lie.
How come you didn't call me last night?
I demand an explanation for this mistake.
If she had married you, she would be happy now.
I'm ready!
I loved that.
She forgot to feed the dog.
He drank straight from the bottle.
I don't understand that question.
It doesn't look too hard.
I felt a drop of rain.
My grandfather takes a walk every morning.
Grab a spoon.
Give him time.
Tom started a bonfire on the beach.
Many men want to be thin, too.
I don't feel like playing.
This book is too expensive.
Is that what Tom told you?
I tried everything.
Were you spying on me?
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmer.
He was conscious of her presence.
Do you like summer?
The landlord changed the locks.
They've lost so much.
I had to get some help.
I feel like such an idiot.
We got all the materials together.
It's fun.
I just want a vacation.
This chimney is made of brick.
Looking at your Facebook friends' photos is a waste of time.
There's a full moon tonight.
Tom can do it, can't he?
I took the little girl by the hand.
It didn't go very well.
I was arrested last week.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
You may not remember me, but I remember you.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
They'll understand us.
The company wants to hire 20 people.
We're getting married in October.
I just got a call from your school.
The whole nation wants peace.
Tom asked Mary to get him a cup of coffee.
As far as I know, that never happened.
By the way, what's your address?
Now that I have a girlfriend, I'm happy.
There are only 10 minutes left until the end of the lesson.
The answer was discouraging.
The answer was yes.
Stay a while and listen.
May I go to bed?
I hope we didn't wake you.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
You don't have to answer.
Can I use a credit card for payment?
Her skin is perfectly smooth.
Did you live here before?
It has to be tomorrow night.
I want you to tell me what to do.
I don't feel very well. I should go home.
Our house was built in 2013.
My sister took the children to the zoo.
That sounds too good to be true.
Are you nervous?
They do it each week.
Nothing happened.
When I got home, I had a nice, ice-cold shower.
I'd like to apply for a job.
That's a risk you just have to take.
You must be very special.
We're a little pressed for time.
I know that I can trust Tom.
My wife is a good manager.
I made an appointment to see the doctor at four o'clock.
I often went fishing with him.
He didn't help his father.
I sat down and opened my laptop.
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
I said that.
A man's worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is.
Everyone is exhausted.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
His behavior is very odd today.
He is the only one of my friends that is talented.
The burglar gained access to the house through a window.
What are we doing for lunch?
He seldom gets angry.
Butter and cheese are made from milk.
You're so impatient.
I really can't accept this.
And what do I have to do now?
He accused me of being a liar.
All of my things are gone.
I promise you I'll come early.
The TV's on.
Tom has a heavy German accent.
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.
Someone stole my passport.
I don't have enough RAM.
We can't finish this by Monday.
They're late, as usual.
She is aware of my secret plan.
That's a pretty name.
They shouldn't have written that.
Your performance was very good.
We're not giving up.
This place hasn't changed much.
He turned traitor.
What's the worst tattoo you've ever seen?
It's not good for business.
Who's at home?
Hot, dry areas will become hotter and drier.
You don't seem very sure.
You're the one who should pay the bill.
I'd rather die than give you this.
Those are mine.
I opened a bottle of red wine.
I have no money in my pocket.
It wouldn't be the same without you.
Are you interested?
I could be of help.
We were crazy about each other.
I can't stand the cold.
I hate fighting.
That'll be difficult.
Be respectful.
I have to say I envy you.
That's all I need to say.
Do you know why I was in prison?
We're still active.
Tom is very kind to us.
Please turn off the light before you go to bed.
My friends call me Tom.
How did you learn to speak French so well?
It's bound to happen sooner or later.
You can't hide forever.
You're such an idiot!
At least give me a chance.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
It's still warm.
Tom is already thirteen.
I have plenty of friends.
How many do you need?
The car has been acting strangely.
Don't make me go back there.
Call 1-800-828-6322 for a free brochure.
I will come if I have time.
Please turn off your engine.
I told him to be quiet.
It is really quite a good story.
Thanks for the pizza.
We don't have the money.
I can't remember the last time I ate with my family.
The door blew shut.
I've been out of town.
Everything is all right at home.
Last year, the company was sold to private investors.
She is extremely attractive.
Do you think Tom hates me?
I'm very hungry.
He was found lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
That team has strong players.
The crocodile is a protected species.
This makes sense.
You are hearing things.
What did you see?
We went back down into the cellar.
I'm not good at eating Japanese food with chopsticks.
Mary is going to have a baby.
He asked me two questions.
They may leave tomorrow.
I've already promised to do that.
Don't write me such long letters.
We're not stupid.
We shouldn't be doing this.
This button is loose.
They can manage.
Everyone looked puzzled.
They tried to cheer me up.
Would you mind sharing your table?
I regret what I said.
That's not good enough for you.
She got all the more angry because I kept silent.
I'm sure that he will take part in the contest.
Did he show you the picture?
He's very ill.
How much will you get?
He couldn't help laughing at it.
Who are you going with?
If they find us, we're dead.
I was unable to look her in the face.
Tom said you were good at chess.
He went on talking as though nothing had happened.
Who drew it?
Most Americans like hamburgers.
Somebody is playing the piano.
He gave in.
I think Tom is sleeping.
Do I look old?
I can't let the matter drop.
They were all here.
He risked his life to save her.
You can make your own.
The building collapsed in the earthquake.
It takes time to speak a foreign language well.
You would be safe there.
Please wait till noon.
It's dead.
I wish it was Valentine's Day!
I can't believe he kissed you.
Stay and have a drink with us.
We haven't had time to do that yet.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
He lives all alone in the woods.
Who gave you this?
He grinned broadly at us.
I need support.
We had lived there for ten years when the war broke out.
Look at the cat.
He will object to your going abroad.
Tom couldn't stop talking to Mary.
It isn't something I want to do.
You're weird.
It certainly looks like rain.
Many schools are closed today because of the storm.
He wrote down all the details.
Could you do this instead of me?
You can't keep doing this to yourself.
I think Tom is likely to go to Boston in the near future.
Do you have any rock CDs?
Poverty drove him to steal.
This looks like a trap.
Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
She kept silent about the problem.
Let's split the reward fifty-fifty.
He tried to kill himself.
I don't like her.
Someone stole my bicycle.
Do you want to see her very much?
Tom feels that his team will win the game.
This is terrible.
He said he would call tomorrow.
Mary is pregnant.
This is exactly where it happened.
You're very observant.
Is this your letter?
I oppose it.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
We all got in the car.
Here is a book.
This is insane.
That was our mistake.
Thank you for all of your work.
Can we stay ahead of them?
We'll call you.
Did I miss the turn?
Don't blame me for your mistakes.
I'm here, aren't I?
One's new. The other's old.
He held on firmly to the branch.
You should exercise more.
Tom hopes that Mary will come next weekend.
There's ice cream in the freezer.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
You're not going to believe this.
Tom is OK.
Do you think that's the answer?
We agreed among ourselves.
I was about to go out when he came to see me.
The news leaked out.
Tom is a chimney sweep.
I think that she knows the truth.
Tom is obviously very good at what he does.
Her voice is pleasant to listen to.
She can sew very well.
Tom advised Mary not to believe everything she reads on the Web.
I believe in my abilities.
You're awfully quiet this morning.
I want you to help me clean it up.
He was obviously drunk.
Is it serious?
Thank you for your courtesy.
I want to go there once more.
What do you want in return?
Did you live here?
I found it while I was cleaning up.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
It is going to rain soon.
Don't you think that Tom was a little weird?
You've had all week to study.
Don't take yourself so seriously.
He set his house on fire.
I could never do that.
I think I'm done.
This breaks my heart.
Boston is a great town.
How often do you have to see the dentist?
I can't do any more.
If the sun were to rise in the west, I wouldn't change my mind.
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a moment.
You don't have to lie.
No matter what happens, just keep smiling.
He has already said yes.
You won't need that.
Do I have to take off my shoes here?
She advised him to get more exercise.
Tom is getting on your nerves, isn't he?
They're up to no good.
Are you here on holiday?
I don't like those people.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
I don't mean you.
Our kids are fat.
Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17th.
I spent the whole afternoon chatting with friends.
I'm afraid I'm not available.
You can't do that here.
He was looking through a microscope.
Why do people kneel down to pray?
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
You're very stylish.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
You are right in a way.
I didn't go to school because I was sick.
I have a lot of love for you.
It's because I love you.
Chess and checkers are favorites with them.
Despite all my efforts, I will not have the report ready by Friday.
I forgot your phone number.
I think it's perfect.
Please sign this receipt.
We saw laborers blasting rocks.
Let me show you something really awesome.
Tom is already in a bad mood.
You should not go alone.
You shouldn't go around telling lies about people.
I figured that you'd enjoy this movie.
Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task.
It has no bearing on this problem.
You're sure about this, right?
I feel happy.
Our train is late.
Was he, in fact, guilty of wrongdoing?
I sent an email to you.
There are four main causes of alcohol-related death. Injury from car accidents or violence is one. Diseases like cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, heart and blood system diseases are the others.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
What is the price of this cap?
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
You'll have a rough time.
That's very thoughtful.
We're stubborn.
I remember that guy.
Frankly speaking, I don't like your haircut.
I was happy for him.
I assume that your mission was a success.
I broke a nail.
Tom is wearing a new coat, isn't he?
I'm not good-looking.
I met her on campus yesterday.
Tom and I went to a party last night.
I'm here as a friend.
Shouldn't you be telling us that?
My father won't allow me to do that.
It's already 2:30 and Tom isn't here yet.
Do you have them?
We don't want anyone asking questions.
I don't want to torment you any longer.
She cried for joy when she heard that her son had survived the plane crash.
Has all the coke been drunk?
He had an accident and broke his leg.
It no longer matters.
I thought you were broke.
I slept on the plane for a couple of hours.
Tom isn't sure what time the party starts.
Tom sells postcards to tourists.
This word is both a noun and a verb.
I didn't think anyone was home.
Could you move just a little closer?
It's going really well.
The years pass by quickly.
Too much drinking will make you sick.
It occurred to me spontaneously.
I want to return your money.
It's against my principles.
It's a very stressful job.
Five thousand dollars is a large sum of money.
I paid in advance.
I'm just not feeling up to it right now.
He let on that he was a lawyer.
He barely passed the examination.
Tom is now older and wiser.
Soldiers must carry out their orders.
I think that would be better.
Tom is much better at French than me.
I really miss my girlfriend.
You could've told me.
Are you sure they can do this?
I suggest we swim across the river.
I'm doing you a favor.
You're biased.
He climbed over the fence.
Who told you the story?
The grand jury decided not to indict the police officer.
Their marriage broke up last year.
I heard someone knock on the door.
He felt a sudden urge to write a novel.
They're afraid of me.
Are you in trouble?
I'm thirty.
Tom got mad at Mary because she was late.
I need it today.
I found the empty box.
She forced him to sit down.
What did I ever do to you?
I'm just as confused as you are.
Whose fault is it?
I found this column interesting.
How do you think I feel?
This gift is for you.
He put his hands in his pockets.
Most signs are written in English.
Are you sure of it?
Aren't you and I friends?
I'm invited to dinner this evening.
I love Tom and at the same time I hate him.
It is impossible to live without water.
Tom wears thick glasses.
Mary had a ring on every finger of her left hand.
She and I usually agree.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
That's one of ours.
Their loss is our gain.
Come on, get up.
Who wouldn't like that?
No one trusts Tom.
You amuse me.
Did you write down the number?
Don't act like a know-it-all.
I was jealous of you.
I'm sure Tom will know what to do.
What season do you like the best?
Please put your cigarette out.
Everyone had to start working.
I jog twice a week.
The universe was born more than 12 billion years ago.
He told me that whatever might happen, he was prepared for it.
Ouch!! I've been stung by a bee!!
Tom's drunk.
You're not fooling anybody.
Tell me all the details.
She got into the car and drove off.
You'll never regret this.
That boy has black hair.
I want to make a complaint.
They treat their employees well.
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
Tom used to live on a farm.
It should be no problem.
My wife and I are expecting our first child.
You're enjoying yourselves, aren't you?
I parked on the left side of the street just in front of the school.
Tom sometimes walks to work.
Lie still.
Don't be mean.
You have made the very same mistake again.
Please tell me where the marketplace is.
I put it in your room.
You are important.
You're invited.
Don't wait up.
I saw you outside.
Something had to be done.
How many women have you talked to since you got out of prison?
I missed the train by only a few minutes.
It was in London that I last saw her.
They'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway.
Do you see patients on Saturdays?
You're a good guitarist. "I'd like to think I am."
He was deserted by his friends.
Could you tell me the Wi-Fi password, please?
Let's go over what we already know.
Is somebody there?
I have a dream.
Were you aware of this?
The cat crouched down ready to jump.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
I made a deal.
Why do you resist?
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
I have something to say to all of you.
Doesn't anyone care?
I'm thirty years older than you.
Don't expose it to the rain.
He did both at the same time.
They fell into the conversation immediately.
Only six people were present at the party.
Is there something you want to ask?
The baby stopped crying.
Do you have an opinion?
You're sure about this, right?
I live miles away from the nearest station.
I cut myself shaving this morning.
Don't you move or I'll shoot.
It is clear that he is guilty.
Tom doesn't have anything to eat.
Where's everyone going?
There is an urgent need for new ideas.
He assigned me a new job.
I really think you should stop doing that.
I'll stay here a whole month.
You must not discuss this with anyone.
Where are my things?
Did you enjoy yourself?
He said that his father was ill, but it was a lie.
It was bound to happen some day.
I have information.
You gotta get more organized.
You need a key to open the box.
That was fun, wasn't it?
What did you answer?
This is my wife.
Do you drink?
Please forgive me for being late.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom is the tallest boy on our football team.
Have you worked the puzzle out?
You're out of touch with reality.
He's cruel and heartless.
We're journalists.
It's already been done.
I want to make you happy.
Last night, we looked at the stars from the rooftop.
Nobody showed up today.
It may possibly be fine tomorrow.
Is there a man in your life?
This is our house.
I like dogs very much.
It hurts here.
It's a good way to make friends.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
I stayed at a nice hotel.
Do I have to leave a deposit?
I can't move my legs.
Mary asked her family for a loan.
What are you going to do with it?
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
Why are you so insecure?
You will always be in my heart.
Nobody appreciates me.
Are things OK with you?
Tom is at home with his wife.
I know exactly where I want to go.
Are you playing games with me?
Tom doesn't need to dress up.
Here's your drink.
I know Tom is troubled.
I heard that a paralyzed man was eaten alive by maggots.
She was used to living on a small income.
Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
I got very sleepy.
It's time-consuming.
Tom wants to come.
I'm as old as you.
I wish I could've spoken to Tom.
I can't help doing that.
Are you suggesting another theory?
This history book is written for high school students.
The week is finally over.
She ignored all my warnings.
I don't feel like it.
We may as well start at once.
Do you play any sports?
He is living with his friend for the time being.
The garrison was forced to surrender.
I don't want to let you go.
There's no way I'm going to work on Sunday.
Are you finished reading the newspaper?
All is well that ends well.
I don't know anything about cricket.
More and more married couples share household chores.
Tom didn't go to the dance.
He has been asked to sit on the committee.
Tom took a lot of photographs.
Why is Tom here?
This book is not for sale.
I really do appreciate all your hard work.
I promised not to tell.
This is not enough.
The local newspaper is endorsing the conservative candidate.
Why don't you ask me what you really want to know?
I didn't quite know what to say.
Tom stole Mary's phone and took a bunch of selfies before sneaking it back into her purse.
I'll go tell the others what we need to do.
You won't believe this.
Tom wrote to a friend.
Tom is in reasonably good health.
This symphony is a real masterpiece.
Don't forget that.
I will be through with the book in no time.
I went to Paris.
It's a pity that he can't get married to her.
I have no idea who that is either.
She's wearing a cool hat.
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
He will be here soon.
I don't even have a car anymore.
I must go now.
I want you to kiss me.
You're fair.
I forgot his phone number.
I already have a bus ticket.
Be careful.
You might get something in the mail today.
Do you have to work tonight?
It isn't too late for you.
The real heroes are us.
We talked to each other for a while.
It's no laughing matter.
Go outside.
What's there to do?
Don't be so impatient.
He lives in the next town.
His name sounds familiar.
He takes a bath every morning.
I'm not old enough.
Do you have a dog?
How much do you want?
Tom is leaving.
Please come and help me.
Would you care for some more cake?
What's this dog's name?
They spoke briefly.
That's correct.
Think it over and tell me what you decide.
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
You had a good weekend, didn't you?
Many children at this school are malnourished.
Do I need this?
Your problems are similar to mine.
The detective shadowed the suspect for four blocks.
She advised him not to buy a used car, but he didn't follow her advice.
I hope Tom is mistaken.
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
If he had been honest, I would have employed him.
I felt it my duty to do so.
He used to read at night.
A father provides for his family.
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
She assured him that everything was OK.
Since I will see him tomorrow, I can give him a message if you want.
Tom is proud of you.
I don't know what would happen if I ever lost you.
Please come with us.
I don't know whether he's younger or older than I am.
No one spoke.
It's a pity that you can't travel with us.
One of the main products of this country is coffee.
I've got a plan.
Tell her that I love her.
It seems that you're not having fun in here.
Can I have one of those?
Let in some fresh air.
What medicine do you recommend?
I don't know what you're so worried about.
You and Tom are made to be together.
Give me an alternative.
I don't think I can do that.
I'll wait in the gym.
If you speak too fast, I will not be able to understand.
I know that you love Tom.
Instead of going himself, he sent his brother in his place.
How many of your friends have beards?
Got it!
We could see the lights of the town in the distance.
She has many dogs.
You're a good man.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
What is the purpose of education?
His father passed away last night in the hospital.
Only 16 percent of the teachers of this school are female.
Oh my God! What are you doing!?
Was this wall built to keep people out or to keep them in?
How soon do you need it?
You don't seem very sure.
I want to know what you're doing here.
I didn't realize you were awake.
Big people aren't always strong.
I need a little more time.
My father goes to Sydney twice a year on business.
They were soldiers.
You're not a loser.
I just want to take a quick look.
I am happy to hear your voice.
That's all I can promise.
I've had a very busy morning.
Are any seats still available?
He was tired then.
Nothing lasts forever.
I prefer dogs to cats.
She told me that her mother had bought it for her.
The foreign minister attended the talks.
That's where I went yesterday.
She was on the verge of crying.
You are the first to arrive.
Do you smoke?
Don't try to do too much.
Tom has blue eyes.
The world economy is in recession now.
You're such an idiot!
Keep away from the fire.
Is he a friend of yours?
I didn't think that you could do that.
Where are the boys?
We're all disappointed.
I'd just like to say I'm sorry.
I'll never forgive him.
How much did you pay for the dress?
It's excruciatingly slow.
I have a favor to ask of you.
All of my friends like computer games.
Tom thinks you should talk to Mary.
I've already had a coffee.
It was kind of you to help me.
We have to do that this week.
Where's everyone else?
I am glad to help you.
Tom expected to leave early in the morning, but he overslept.
The exhibition was very impressive.
Do you mind if I turn off the light?
She grows tomatoes in her garden.
The family had its dinner at noon.
The room was so dark that we had to feel our way to the door.
It's not like you're going to get arrested or anything.
Their teacher praised them.
It's a lot of fun playing outdoors.
Would you please stop pacing around like that and just sit down for a second?
It already has taken me hours.
She came up with a good way of making money by using the Internet.
You should get rid of these weeds.
He did his best to rescue her.
I lost no time in doing it.
The doctor did a good job on my leg.
Do you have any French newspapers?
Where did he learn this?
How long were you gone?
I don't eat meat.
Could you be a little more specific?
The athletic meet was put off until next week.
I wasn't aware that someone was watching me.
I don't know how to reach you.
We haven't decided yet.
Take as many as you want.
Classes start at eight in the morning.
Tom made a pilgrimage.
There's no way to know.
You were drunk last night, weren't you?
I don't like swimming in salt water.
I know Tom isn't a racist.
It's hot in here.
What color do you like?
I never made such a promise.
From year to year, pollution is worsening.
Show me where it happened.
I know this.
He committed suicide to atone for his sin.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
You aren't as short as I am.
I can protect you.
Those are nice.
I beg your pardon.
The financial crisis has left many unemployed.
I think I lost my keys.
We all had the same idea.
I don't have to be here. I'm here because I want to be.
Are you seriously thinking about buying a computer from that store?
Beats me.
I would do it again.
Tom never said what he was planning to do.
We decided to help Tom.
You didn't scare me off.
We'll get another one.
He doesn't yet know the truth.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
I feel a lot better than before.
He always walks with a rifle.
They fought until the end.
This flower is more beautiful than that one.
Time for dinner.
I have to go to work.
Why did they do that?
I'm not as young as I used to be.
I built this doghouse by myself.
I did it many times.
I don't know how to do that.
I caught a cold two days ago.
I want one, but not this one.
The children made a giant snowman.
Who did you buy this for?
Are you coming to my party?
She wasn't friendly with him then.
You're always finding fault with me.
Well, let's talk turkey.
The driver was charged with speeding.
She loves watching tennis matches on TV.
He can also speak a little Greek.
You better hurry.
What time did your friend go home?
What's in your hand?
You're feeling very sleepy, aren't you?
What did I do?
They made us work all day.
I hope you'll agree.
Suddenly it began to rain.
I know they'll all want to help you.
Okay, I'm ready.
After a while, he came to.
I subscribe to two newspapers.
No one knows the answer.
He had no difficulty in finding the place.
It's not for everyone.
Can I ask a quick question?
I don't want anyone to see us.
I always drink a glass of milk before going to sleep.
Strawberries are in season now.
Where did I put the hammer?
I bought two loaves of bread.
Luckily nobody drowned.
He gave his children a good education.
My premonition turned out to be right.
I like studying wild flowers.
I have to do what's right.
We left the final decision to him.
Do you want to make a deal?
I think it'd be better if Tom didn't tell Mary about this.
That isn't complex.
Tom is probably just a little younger than Mary.
I just want to make enough money to feed my family.
Will you have another slice of pie? "Yes, please."
She studies in the library after school.
She was wearing long boots.
Truer words have never been spoken.
Did you lock the doors?
Keep the money.
I think it's unlikely that plants feel pain.
What do you think of that?
It seems to me that you're wrong.
He backed his car into the garage.
The ring was nowhere to be found.
She was kind enough to show me the way.
Is that deliberate?
Drive carefully.
She touched him on the shoulder.
He is in excellent physical condition.
I hope you had a great weekend.
I want to study abroad next year.
You know what song I want to sing.
That might be possible.
You may as well get used to it.
You look good in black.
I can't imagine why.
I want you to have a job that you love.
The questionnaire form was distributed properly.
Do you like mine?
Do you find the work too hard?
He set off to Paris.
Are you finished reading the newspaper?
He was the last person I had expected to see during my stay in America.
Is it true that you were on TV yesterday?
This is the worst of all.
He took a quick look at the magazine.
I'm really sleepy.
Tom said he likes studying French.
He is a good husband to me.
No one was alive.
Tom found no one in the house.
We are having a serious talk about your future.
Tom doesn't think this is such a good idea.
Miraculously, nobody was seriously injured.
What's the minimum wage in Australia?
The mother of that child is an announcer.
I got out of the taxi.
It's urgent.
Quit acting like a baby.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
His warm way with people had made him hugely popular.
I can't. It's too big.
We can't do that now.
I hate everyone.
You disappointed me.
Do you have a knife?
You'd better hand that over.
You're a good liar.
I sure wish you would leave.
I'll meet up with you later.
When is the next train to Boston?
Is this a coincidence?
I have enough money to buy it.
Do you intend to answer all my questions truthfully?
You don't know anything.
Be quiet for a moment.
How many people were there?
It's not about them.
I just had a sandwich so I'm not hungry.
You've got a great memory.
There's a sucker born every minute.
Tom probably didn't do the work himself.
Please tell me you're joking.
She's very interested in music.
I'm so happy for you, Tom.
Tom walks faster than Mary.
Tom tried to save Mary.
I want mine.
You're finicky.
Where were you? We've been looking all over for you.
I didn't know I was adopted.
Sumo is a traditional Japanese sport.
If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
This is for your own safety.
The boy sat on a chair.
He prided himself on his punctuality.
I had my thumbnail torn off.
I don't plan on doing that by myself.
Our team lost.
I am not interested in material gain.
The painting is all but finished.
I can get us in.
He's a hunk.
I like westerns.
I attended the seminar.
I'm tired of him bawling me out.
I don't mind being criticized when I am wrong.
Don't ask so many questions.
Travel agencies' profits soared.
I was a criminal.
He bent over backward to please his wife.
She was advised by him to give up drinking.
I'm glad to have a roof over my head.
Everything is working out just as Tom predicted.
Did you lose something?
Why didn't you call me last night?
Tom is older than he looks.
I talked.
I thought we could use the cloth napkins.
Did you have a lot of happy experiences in your childhood?
It's getting dark.
Is reprinting this article a possibility?
He doesn't look happy.
He got up to see if he had turned off the light in the kitchen.
They deserve respect.
I've tried to be your friend.
He often suffered from toothaches.
I hear that Tom can speak French.
I corrected myself.
I hope you're not planning to do that today.
We have a lot to learn from other cultures.
We're not your enemy.
The date of manufacture is shown on the lid.
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
Tom has narrow shoulders.
You're late.
We haven't seen it yet.
He became brave in the face of danger.
He told me where to go.
I can't kiss you now.
He is a student at Harvard.
I don't want to get involved.
That's my favorite shirt.
An old man broke into our conversation.
Are you having dinner?
Stay out of the rain.
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long.
Everyone is insane, in his or her own way.
I'll come back for you.
I didn't say it.
He sat next to her.
Don't you know who I am?
I'll go first.
It took him three months to learn to ride a bicycle.
This CD belongs to my son.
She hired him as a programmer.
1989 was a difficult year.
Tom was really crazy.
They have two daughters.
We did nothing wrong. It was only a kiss.
Do you remember the day when we saw the accident?
You have good taste in music.
I've discovered the victim's identity.
I had my hair cut at a barber's shop.
I don't know what you really want.
Thank you for the wonderful meal.
I knew it was just a misunderstanding.
I'm getting tired of this.
A piano is expensive.
Maybe you should call the police.
I don't really understand what just happened.
Tom wants me to help him.
We're not sure.
I'd like to make it clear that I will not change my mind.
You have to be patient.
I write every chance I get.
I wish you'd stop doing that.
I prefer to go by bicycle.
Let's meet in front of the library.
I try to keep a low profile.
She pulled him out of the mud.
He came back before eight.
Are you a psychologist?
I don't want to take a walk now.
I always win.
I beg you to give me a little water.
Tom is obviously a jerk.
This is your house.
Come if you can.
I didn't have the sense to do so.
Do you know when they will arrive?
Nothing is happening.
Let me explain what's happened.
I was so humiliated.
I need to talk to you privately.
The Apollo program greatly advanced our knowledge of space.
It seems that I've lost my keys.
You can sing a song.
That's all we do here.
I'm getting off the train at the next station.
Mary is now studying in her room.
I don't have any money.
She hired him.
Folks, it's time I was leaving.
I want to know how they do that.
His family works in the fields.
It doesn't matter what game he plays, he always wins.
Why is Tom still here?
Did anyone hear me?
I strolled along the streets to kill time.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
This is impossible for me.
Are you studying?
Be respectful.
I like what you've written.
I just want to be his friend.
She seems tired.
They often make fun of the boss.
I gave some of my old clothes to the Salvation Army.
I don't know how to say goodbye in French.
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
How many books do you have in your bag?
She advised him to stop drinking.
You should marry someone you love.
Tom opened the door, even though I asked him not to.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
I'm the one who picked those flowers.
I want to be a nurse.
I don't like it any more than you do.
The church is on the other side of the street.
Is that all?
I've decided to agree to do that.
Tom left the door unlocked.
I don't know exactly how or why that happened.
I am very dangerous.
We're all devastated.
Come over.
I like chess.
A new school building is under construction.
That's a lot of cash.
I had no idea you could dance.
Did you accomplish your goals?
You can park on either side of the street.
No way!
She looked worried about her school report.
I don't know why that should surprise me.
He wouldn't even speak to me.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
It's a sign of the times.
I appreciate how you feel.
You should have kept your mouth shut.
We're new in town.
Are you an exchange student?
Strive to be happy.
He speaks as if he were an expert.
Who came?
I cringed.
We saw a stranger walking outside.
I had to get out of the house.
Tom doesn't know what to say.
I have two cars.
Do you give to charity?
If we had wings, could we fly to the moon?
Tom certainly doesn't need any more money.
What do you spend most of your time on the computer doing?
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
She went to Italy to study music.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
He can imitate the rest of the family.
You can't do this to yourself.
I eventually want to be fluent in German.
Tom has stopped going to school.
I need air.
Were you two close?
You can't deny that anymore.
Tom wanted to make a change.
Why don't you stay a minute?
If you're happy, I'm glad.
I have been to the airport to see him off.
Do you want this room painted, too?
We gave our word.
We couldn't go out because of the heavy rain.
I shrugged my shoulders.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Sputnik was launched on October 4, 1957.
You have to go on without me.
She called him every other day.
We got behind the car and pushed.
He had a loving family.
I have less money than you.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
You didn't prepare me for this.
No one answered my question.
The news made her sad.
Don't forget the ticket.
Can you continue?
Tom must be tired now.
Both his father and mother are dead.
I advise customers.
Do you have enough time?
I'm familiar with the subject.
I question your sincerity.
Anything is infinitely better than nothing.
This is your chance.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
The criminal was arrested by the police.
Flags of the world fly proudly at the United Nations headquarters.
I bet you didn't know that.
Let me help you with the dishes.
You despise me, don't you?
She left her ticket at home.
Fish like carp and trout live in fresh water.
They basked in the sun.
He gave it to me.
They're not coming.
All the answers are correct.
I knew Tom was a bartender.
I'm better-looking than Tom.
I think they saw you.
I'll be perfectly all right.
His sons do as they please.
The boy lay listening to the radio.
He has written a letter.
Your birthday is coming soon.
Are you registered?
Frankly speaking, he is wrong.
They kissed.
Don't be alarmed.
You have been busy.
Two months have passed since he left for France.
Is the movie theater near the station?
There's not enough food for all of us.
Thanks to his advice, I have saved a lot of money.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
It was impolite of him to do so.
He's three years older than me.
He's not at home.
Let's start after he comes home.
I wasn't informed of this.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
The tornado touched down two kilometers from my school.
There's a restaurant pretty close to here, but it's not very good.
According to the paper, there was an earthquake in Peru.
Tom is already out of school.
His birthday falls on Sunday.
Tom knows that I'm Canadian.
I should go with you.
I was studying.
She's most happy when she's at home.
After the storm, the sea was calm.
Read it once more.
He claimed that he had returned the book to the library.
Who's Tom looking at?
Tom plays tennis with Mary at least once a week.
I really like this one.
Japan is made up of volcanic islands.
Get me some water.
I realize that there's a problem.
My sister is so annoying.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
Should I come?
I'm sure that I'll miss her a lot.
I couldn't control my anger.
Ghosts exist.
I visited my grandmother's house.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Do you mind if I ask why?
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
It was a great blow to us.
Let's cross here.
Team members are provided with equipment and uniforms.
I can't wait to leave this place.
You look a little shaken.
She has put her house up for sale.
Who invited you here?
What's the target?
I studied hard when I was in school.
All of us are getting older.
We need a strategy.
She showed him several books that were on the shelf.
Tom smells weird.
Tom says he doesn't know.
It's never too late to make amends for harm done.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
All the rooms are taken.
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.
Seal the room.
I've left my charger at home.
You should spend a little time each day reviewing vocabulary.
That's not the issue.
I wanted to see you.
That is his car.
They were pretty tired after having worked all day.
I was asked to fix the bicycle.
You've got the wrong person.
Do you live here?
What's it used for?
We're not perfect.
Give me your address.
I wonder what could be in the box.
It's impossible to describe.
Let's handle this one problem at a time.
Do your best and don't worry.
What kind of games do you create?
It could get tense.
Don't kill me.
You must take care of yourself.
He did better than last time.
Come off it!
They live in the same state.
I'm glad that the rain has stopped.
What is important in writing a composition is to make your ideas clear.
I think you know that.
I'm going to take my car.
Tell me about your plan.
You can't handle the truth.
Tom refused to take part in the game.
He is accustomed to working hard.
I didn't take any books from the library.
He started singing.
You need to relax.
Do you like white chocolate?
You're not alone anymore.
I've never been this happy before.
Do you study French?
I think I broke it.
This is as heavy as lead.
We traveled around Australia.
Tom didn't know what Mary's last name was.
Science is cool.
This is how I made it.
Is French a difficult language to learn?
Eat your soup while it is hot.
I'll be happy to work with you.
Tom is relieved.
Is this the art department?
What did you do to my phone?
Which one of them was it?
I can't see what you mean.
I thought you might want a drink.
I'm looking for my keys. Have you seen them?
Tom has been eating at that restaurant since he was a teenager.
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
These clothes are dirty and need to be washed.
Not knowing what to say, I remained silent.
There is a good chance that he will win.
The very idea of being sent abroad delighted them.
You are under oath.
She went to the airport to see him off.
No one knows his real name.
Is it going to clear up? "I hope so."
He had no qualms in doing so.
My garden is small.
Watch how I do it.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
What do you remember?
I love hamburgers.
It always happens like this.
I got there ahead of time.
It's just not right.
That was well worth the trouble.
Tom is always crying.
Scientists haven't found a cure for cancer yet.
I'd rather do this alone.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
What do you think I did?
I like seeing you this way.
Give it to whoever needs it.
The dog is drooling.
The change was immediate.
They are all innocent children.
He is said to have died here.
I'm pretty angry.
I know what they mean.
They are going shopping.
You almost died.
I'm taking care of my grandfather.
We don't need it anymore.
We're all to blame for that.
This is what I was waiting for.
Is that what's going on here?
You had better prepare for the future.
She wants to marry a millionaire.
I may have told you such a thing, but I don't remember it at all.
I punched him in the chin.
I have to brush my teeth.
I don't even think about it anymore.
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
You're very nice.
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
Fresh food is wonderful.
He treats me like a child.
Tom is the tallest in our class.
There is no need to worry about shortages for the moment.
We lost a lot on that job.
I said he could go.
We're both insane.
We got ready.
We know you're interested.
I was a bit unlucky.
You're in better shape than I am.
Everybody knows the news.
Tom and Mary had a picnic by the waterfall.
Do you like going to work?
This costs too much.
The smell of dirty socks makes me want to throw up.
We still have enough time to discuss it.
I'm trying to learn French.
I am too tired to keep on walking.
I thought you and Tom were going to go to Boston.
Tom and Mary don't know each other.
I would like to have a look at your collection of stamps.
They are exhausted.
I don't know anything about what happened.
That was so cool.
When will the new magazine come out?
She did it on purpose.
I never would've allowed that.
I went into partnership with him.
Do we have to speak French?
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me.
You're too slow.
You drive a hard bargain.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
Tom has no common sense.
What time are you coming back?
It's illegal to park your car here.
You've misunderstood.
He arrived at the station.
Hurry up, or we'll miss the train.
Do you get it?
I'm 18 years old.
I don't have a cat.
She gave him all of her silver.
I was afraid he might die.
We can't give up.
I just want you to come.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
He earns 300,000 yen a month.
She doesn't have many friends.
I had a headache, so I couldn't do that.
As soon as he went to bed, he fell asleep.
Please don't leave me here by myself.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
You look tired.
Is there anything in this box?
I haven't seen you in weeks.
The price of everything increased.
I am harvesting wheat.
I know you don't trust us.
People make mistakes in a situation like this.
I can't really remember.
I'm not so confident.
Did you read the whole book?
She has a negative attitude toward life.
I was on the phone.
Tom can speak German as well as English.
I've found a job.
We waited anxiously.
You're a bad liar.
There is a pond in the middle of the park.
Is it possible to help Tom?
They trusted you.
My jeans won't fit.
Do your job.
I am very sorry for what I said.
He wants more.
Tom is nuts.
May I introduce myself?
Who knows what's going to happen?
She is rich, certainly, but I don't think she's very smart.
I took care of that.
Thank you for making it so easy.
You're hurting me.
I thought you'd be more helpful.
The power of his physique is evident to all who look at him.
I am not a teacher.
You should take my advice.
I guess I could use a shower.
Now let's get down to work.
Does truth matter?
Go down this road until you get to a traffic light and then turn left.
Can you prove it?
You will miss the train if you don't hurry.
I'm sure Tom intended to do that.
I have to go home now.
How come you're always so energetic?
I don't want to buy it if I don't need it.
Night is when most people sleep.
You did that the wrong way.
I guess we could try doing that.
I agree with him on that point.
Cancer can be cured easily if it is found in its first phase.
Today is Wednesday.
Aren't you going to invite Tom to the party?
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
My brother is ambidextrous.
Did anyone call me up?
I'd like this fight to end.
Take what you want.
I've never done that before.
That still leaves us with the question of why.
She spends her free time making dolls.
I appreciate any assistance you can offer.
Their trip was postponed because of the rain.
How could Tom do that?
I will always love Mary.
The data hasn't been compiled yet.
We are studying Spanish.
I couldn't do otherwise.
The last time I saw Tom was in October.
I just don't want to hurt anyone.
It'll be known sooner or later.
Industry as we know it today didn't exist in those days.
When did you take the exam?
We're all very worried about you.
That's a joke.
My mother never gets up early.
I have two jobs.
Sorry to interrupt you.
I'm afraid of wild animals.
They always make us do that.
I know this house used to be yours.
Where's your father?
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
Tom left Mary a note.
Don't touch the stove.
It wasn't easy to do that.
Ambition drove him to murder.
I'm reading the newspaper.
Tom kissed Mary's forehead.
What if someone finds out?
I never miss the opportunity to eat Italian food.
Children begin school at the age of six.
I often do my homework before dinner.
You have your hat on backwards.
Put your pajamas on and go to bed.
I'm assuming this is your father.
Tom put thirty dollars on the table.
We have a good heating system.
How long do you plan to stay in this country?
This knife was very useful to me.
I thought it might be of some use.
You'd better hurry.
There is no going back.
I think I'm getting sick.
Tom is dating someone.
He made up an excuse.
Someone left the water running.
Our city police have a new campaign targeting drunken driving.
Take a seat.
I took it for granted that you would come.
I wasn't good enough.
I want you to come with me.
Do you want to do this now?
I met him while he was in Japan.
He made me a suit.
I could've met you at the airport.
It's not subjective.
My older sister got engaged.
Tom is a regular customer.
I'm not afraid to try.
That makes a difference, doesn't it?
We'll be late for class.
A third of the prisoners have escaped.
We lack nothing.
This one is the worst.
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
You need a keycard to open the door.
We heard what sounded like gunshots.
This bicycle belongs to my brother.
At last, she was able to contact her old friend.
Do you feel like going for a swim in the creek later?
I saw Tom kill the neighbor's cat.
He's getting soft in his old age.
I want what you want.
I held on to the rope tightly so I wouldn't fall.
All you do is party.
He remained single all his life.
How do you know they're looking for us?
Are you tired?
Don't tell me you can't read.
We must choose the right moment carefully.
He's racking his brains about how to deal with the matter.
Bring me my glasses.
I figured you might want a drink.
What happens when we run out of water?
How can you be so sure of that?
It's very risky.
Do whatever he tells you.
Their teacher praised them.
We can't protect you.
Don't worry about it!
I thought you'd be proud of me.
What's the catch?
I think you're nuts.
Is it hot?
I have no self-esteem.
The disagreement between the union and management could lead to a strike.
I'm important.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
Do you think this book is worth reading?
I don't suppose there's much chance of that happening.
I want you out of here right now.
His house is easy to find.
You said you wanted the truth.
We need to help each other.
It's quite large.
Do you have children's clothes?
I'll be gone for an entire week.
Haven't you said too much?
We all want you back.
That's all I want to say.
You made a big mistake.
A problem shared is a problem halved.
Tom was shot in the leg.
I'll give you a ride.
Are you on the list?
How soon can you get to my house?
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
How many books can I take out at one time?
Don't open your book.
My grandmother used to use her sewing machine a lot when she was younger.
This will do for a chair.
He said he could do it.
Can you loan me thirty dollars for a cab?
I climbed over the fence.
I can't believe that she did that to me.
You can reach me at the address written here.
I just didn't want you to worry.
Should I go?
I just didn't believe it.
I'm going to call it a night.
He gave back all the money he had borrowed.
Are you falling in love with me?
I barely knew Tom.
He was condemned to death.
They found the room empty.
We played on the beach.
She is going to wash the bike this afternoon.
Tom tossed another log on the fire.
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 and she wasn't happy about that.
The radio warned us of the coming earthquake and we started gathering our things.
You shouldn't get married.
I thanked Mary for her help.
Black coats are in fashion this winter.
I don't know exactly where.
Who did you give it to?
Why would anyone do such a thing?
Your book is on the desk.
I've been feeling this way all day.
The tenor sang very well tonight.
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
Tom told us that he had a headache.
I have won.
They don't like to do that.
I'm sorry to say, but the service isn't very good.
I had to get out of there.
Do you drink green tea?
Those roses are very beautiful.
I had to do this today.
Why don't you take a picture?
Tom knows he has a problem.
He looks tired.
Do you have a pet?
Let's go camping.
Nobody trusts my country.
They were caught red-handed.
He is always on time for an appointment.
I did it for him.
The company announced hundreds of layoffs.
No one voted against it.
He is in the bathroom.
I have a little money.
I did that today for the first time.
That never crossed my mind.
Have you ever read a book written about Japan?
What are all these kids doing here?
After a while passion and infatuation ooze away.
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it.
Have you ever thought about becoming a teacher?
The bus turned the corner and stopped.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
What a selfish woman!
Your phone rang several times while you were in the shower.
This book will awaken your imagination.
He neglects his studies.
What I need is a friend.
The two boys look more alike than I thought.
Did they talk to each other?
He cheated me.
I don't feel much like dancing.
Football is an exciting sport.
I haven't seen you for a while.
Stop acting like a baby.
I watch television every day.
He lived in France for some time, then went to Italy.
Just try it out.
What do you say we buy everyone a drink?
How important is music in your life?
It works fine.
He found the door locked.
What do you really think?
Our house is yours.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
I don't think you would do that.
Tom likes to cook Chinese food.
He has sent the boy on an errand.
I think you are mistaken.
Let's not talk about that here.
There are many rats on the ship.
We're a good team.
Do you want to get drunk?
He slammed his door shut.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Frankly speaking, I don't like you.
It's been a long time since I've written anyone a letter.
How long have you been married?
Parties bore me.
Close the door.
Didn't you feel like going?
You're not invincible.
I need to park my car here.
He explained the rule to me.
You're going to be OK.
I felt betrayed.
You should take advantage of this chance.
We had a minor disagreement.
There's been a lot of activity around the office this morning.
No matter what happens, don't give up.
You owe me something.
I'm not alarmed.
They all have drinks.
He acquired French quickly.
He's still single.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I want this one myself.
All I want to do now is sleep.
Would you like to go to the movies with me?
None of those books are useful.
They look sad.
I arrived here at eight this morning.
He shook his head.
Do you truly believe that it's a good idea?
You have mail.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
I did none of those things.
How many children do you have?
Are you sure about this?
We'll share.
Are you having fun?
We'll rebuild.
The door must not be left open.
We got stuck in a traffic jam, which made us twenty minutes late.
Here, look at this.
It's important that you understand.
I wonder if anybody can help us.
Are you seriously thinking about divorce?
Make yourselves useful.
This is a hundred dollar bill.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Whose turn is it to make dinner tonight?
We ought to do better.
When are you going to get married?
I hate surprise parties.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
Where's the pharmacy?
That's one of ours.
I hope we can fix that.
What happens if we fail?
You can't judge people by their looks.
I was discredited.
I think I hurt his feelings.
He can explain the situation.
It's 8:30.
Could you get me another beer?
I'm not young anymore.
I feel very strongly about that.
He wants vengeance.
I tried it.
My friend helped me.
We import grain from the United States.
I thought I'd never hear that.
Do you have any cough medicine?
I've never seen my cat act like that.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
What have you come here for?
We volunteered.
The play is at eight o'clock.
Do you have a shoehorn?
I'm going to take a bath.
There's nobody on this ship except us.
Your tire is flat.
There's no one there.
She usually walks to school.
It's high time the children went to bed.
I'm very fortunate.
He knows he did something wrong.
You don't have to answer.
I like your personality.
I wonder why Tom is so happy.
Is her hair naturally red?
Show me how to do that.
Did you ask Tom why?
Please do something about it.
Who is that guy?
I will go on foot.
Management hid the true financial state of the company from the workers.
It makes a big difference to me.
If farmers don't make a decent living growing peanuts, they will try growing other crops.
I was afraid of catching a cold.
Catch him.
I want to fly above the clouds.
There was something moving in the distance.
Real friendship is more valuable than money.
Keep your eye on the ball.
I want to apologize for everything I said.
Was it necessary?
I hate dogs.
I intended to have been a teacher.
I wonder if Tom lied to us about that.
Tom and John are brothers-in-law.
How long did you stay at the party?
The boy narrowly escaped drowning.
My neighbors are crazy.
Can my friend sleep over tonight?
I ran into a friend on the bus.
He made up his mind to marry her.
Have you ever been lonely?
I'd better tell you the truth.
That's for you.
Tom has been quiet all day.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I want to see what happens.
They have lost a lot.
He wants to come.
I didn't really think it would happen.
Tom looks pretty nervous.
Well, Tom, you were right.
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
The dictionary on the desk is Tom's.
How is your family name written?
Leave no stone unturned.
You know we'd never hurt you.
He will come if you call him.
I am not frightened of anything.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
Some pitied them.
Tom and I are buddies.
You don't seem to be as organized as Tom seems to be.
Summer has come.
Nobody knows what happened to all that money.
It's not the answer.
It's settled then.
These objects are very useful.
Who did you meet?
I prayed for Tom.
They were all there.
It could be dangerous.
Can we stick to the facts, please?
He pretended to be ignorant.
Do you think she's attractive?
I played the flute.
I didn't say you were crazy.
Tom and Mary never took their eyes off each other.
I'm beginning to get curious.
The plane climbed to an altitude of 10,000 meters.
I have a few things to finish up before I go home.
The bank is closed on Sunday.
See for yourself.
The surgeon amputated the wrong leg.
It's the best we have.
They have enough money.
Where did I put my battery pack?
I want a puppy for Christmas.
Many Americans still had money they had saved during the war.
You're flattering me.
What else do you have?
I'm glad you could make it.
I'm in love.
Can you help me carry this?
Let's watch a movie.
It's nothing to get upset about.
I really mean it.
We're under attack.
Can you afford it?
How old were you when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
I expected that he would come.
It looks like you've been crying.
There's not enough water.
May I suggest another strategy?
The sum of two plus three plus four is nine.
You shouldn't let people use you like that.
She doesn't have any friends or relatives to take care of her.
There's no guarantee that the stock will go up.
I'll do as you advise.
I will wait.
Tom hopes to visit Boston next summer.
Who did you learn it from?
He knows too much.
You'd better leave now.
The police can't arrest you.
I'm proud of my father.
How much did these glasses cost?
Are you sure you don't want one?
Give me something to write on.
Stay calm, and do your best.
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
Tom's situation was different.
Will it fit?
What were they doing here?
I was raised right.
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
Tom has betrayed me.
Keep an eye on him.
He is leaving Chicago tomorrow.
That's all I care about.
Do you want us to take you with us?
I haven't eaten anything all day, but I don't feel hungry.
Apes rank above dogs in intelligence.
I wonder which one I should choose.
I want to know who your friends are.
People in these areas are growing hungrier each year.
He moves quickly.
You're absolutely right.
This surprised many people.
That can't be allowed.
I should've expected it.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Let's reconsider the problem.
Don't tell me any more lies.
We had less snow this winter than we had expected.
I don't want to go with you.
I'm right behind you.
You must be out of your mind.
How many have you killed?
I want you to go back.
This is the best seafood restaurant in the neighborhood.
I let you catch me.
You have a tendency to forget things.
You've come too early.
No weapon was found.
He was unconscious for three days.
I caught it.
Do you have any others?
Just relax.
Do you know where Tom is going?
She lives next door to us.
This story is far more interesting than that one.
My younger brother is watching TV.
Are you ready to go out?
It's too difficult.
What's happening?
Quite a few people came to the party.
Are we just friends?
My life is almost over.
I could have sworn I saw somebody.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
Tom is a history teacher.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
You must respect your elders.
He kept pace with her.
I bought this for my brother.
We left together.
You have no idea how tired I am of all this complaining.
He knows the city well.
They were both drunk.
I'm interfering.
They handled it well.
I'll try to persuade Tom to help.
You will need a bodyguard.
Tom isn't afraid to do anything.
I thought that was the right thing to do.
I'd never seen anything like it.
You are so childish sometimes.
Are you watching carefully?
I learned nothing new.
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
Contact my son.
Tom went running.
Let's go to bed.
I'll never forget going to Hawaii with her.
There is no use waiting for her any longer.
I did see something.

I guess I could use the company.
I was trying to be supportive.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
The water is lukewarm.
Sit here.
I think Tom is old.
This dog saved that little girl's life.
I like your earrings.
It might sound crazy, but I think I'm still in love with Mary.
Why don't you just answer the question?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
He is always forgetting things.
I have to go back to the office.
I'll be leaving now.
We walked up and down the streets of Kyoto.
The house is under repairs.
Can one of you open the door for me?
I get the feeling you don't really want me to go.
She advised him to take a rest.
When is he coming back?
Many foreign customs were introduced into Japan after the war.
Look and see how much the cash register rings up.
Did you feel an earthquake last night?
Tom closed the shop early tonight.
I often use SSH to access my computers remotely.
We have to get you to the hospital.
Walking to work in this heat is a bad idea.
None of us are against his idea.
We know that you're there.
You were lying, weren't you?
You have cute eyes.
Can anyone believe you?
Did you like the movie?
I hate that you have to be here.
I've got nothing to do with this.
There's a big hole in your sock.
Acrobats are very agile.
There's still a lot to learn.
You must be in love.
She listened to music for hours.
I knew that Tom was in bed.
Mary is a wedding planner.
It makes no difference who I meet.
I know why you're here.
Don't you smell something burning in the kitchen?
A driver was sleeping in the car.
I'm outraged.
Let's not get discouraged.
I have a twin sister.
I have no time to read books.
I don't accept it.
I wore a coat so I wouldn't catch a cold.
Would you like tea or coffee?
May I talk to you a minute?
I want to marry her.
Put down the rifle.
Don't let go. Hold on tight.
Tom trusts me.
May I look at that magazine?
Never mind!
How much will you get?
He had the right idea.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
We hardly have time to eat breakfast.
He is getting better bit by bit.
I saved you.
We thought that we wouldn't be able to stop Tom.
My father teaches English at a high school.
Everyone dreams.
You're a funny gal.
Tom said you were in Boston.
You can trust him to keep his word.
Can you hear us?
Forests cover around 9.4% of the earth's surface.
I just want you to think about it.
I want to stay outside.
I don't have an appointment.
The curtains are fireproof.
This is a popular artist.
Does that trouble you?
Can you will yourself to fall asleep?
How did you end up being Tom's manager?
I don't want to be late for class on the first day.
What did you think I was going to suggest?
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was still a child.
I like being with you.
Do you find that washing machine easy to use?
Why didn't they say something?
Tom mopped the kitchen floor.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Every door in the house is locked.
At the end of a working day, everybody is in a hurry to get home.
When it rains, it pours.
The picture looks nicer from a distance.
That's him at the window.
There's nowhere you can hide.
I know that you're smart.
Give Tom a call.
It's taking us way too much time to get this job finished.
I can confirm this.
Tom walked out of the meeting.
Stop following me.
Do not give in to those demands.
I made a lot of mistakes.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
Have you ever been run over?
We have to be careful with expenses.
I was momentarily blinded.
Doctors thought he had a cold.
They're dragging their heels.
I received my birthday present.
She may have left her car key in her room.
I'm at a friend's house.
We're almost out of sugar.
He had served as a congressman and senator.
I never bet.
Does that suit you?
I go to any party I am invited to.
We're not prisoners.
It was silly of him to refuse her offer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
The weather has improved.
Who are they talking to?
I thought you were serious.
Find Tom.
Tom wants answers now.
This book is both interesting and instructive.
Ten years have passed since he died.
We can't keep doing this.
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy.
I don't like that name.
Almost everybody was invited.
Can you believe this is already happening?
This is the man that I see every day on the train.
I knew what was going to happen.
The child sat on his mother's lap and listened to the story.
My sister takes piano lessons twice a week.
You must make up for the loss.
I'm game.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
The child came near being drowned.
Have they arrived yet?
This seems excessive.
Stay home until six.
I didn't need to understand French to know that they were angry.
They're all nuts.
He's more than likely to be late.
I seldom make mistakes.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
My parents were proud of me.
He likes sweet tea.
I've caught a cold.
Are you a team player?
Is she interested in me?
The bus will be here in five minutes.
What's in front of you?
Will it rain this afternoon?
I'm nervous.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't be able to earn more than thirty dollars an hour.
Not all of us are born with musical talent.
Tom doesn't have the right to say that.
I am studying to be a translator or interpreter.
I'll try again.
And now you wish perhaps to learn on less familiar traps?
I apologized immediately.
May I have your name, please?
You can't carry on like this.
The weather today is worse than yesterday.
I've made a couple of friends here.
How many apples do you want?
I'm interested in oriental pottery.
That's always a good sign.
You're very clever.
You were fantastic.
Does that float your boat?
I mistook you for your brother.
If you don't plant the seeds, they won't grow.
I am shorter than you.
You will always be welcome.
You were sleeping, weren't you?
I pretended to work.
He often takes his children to the zoo.
On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers.
I didn't want to get out of bed.
Have you asked if they want one?
I saw someone.
Did you see anyone leave?
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
You need to smile more.
That was very reassuring.
She thought that I was the doctor.
We keep our most interesting thoughts and the most interesting side of ourselves hidden away.
Tom got off the train.
I must go.
We're very excited.
I'm seeing someone.
Tom went to sleep three hours ago.
Is this the place where your mother works?
Tom didn't want to think about it anymore.
Tom carried the suitcases for me.
I think she's 40 years old.
The university administration lowered tuition.
I don't care.
This movie is for adults only.
It looks like you want to say something.
I won't let you drive.
The older we get, the weaker our memory becomes.
How can I repay you?
Tom can't go to school today.
We are going to his house. Want to come with?
Can I go home now?
A billion adults are illiterate.
He was my best friend.
I'm well.
I've come to accept this.
Look at that dog.
You don't seem too sure.
Hold your horses, young man.
I want this cat.
This book goes on the top shelf.
I may go out if the rain lets up.
The car is very fast.
I like chocolate cake.
My sister is bugging me.
Bring me some water.
Yesterday, I put honey in my tea.
I unlocked the door.
Do you want to try it?
I think you look really great.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom came after everybody else had left.
Many paintings hang in the shop.
I thought that Tom was in Australia.
That’s what we heard.
I played football.
What time did your friend go home?
I don't know exactly how or why that happened.
Why are you upset?
She can skate.
I took this picture a week ago.
I'll keep an eye on Tom.
It's worth every penny.
I can't believe you're involved in this.
She knows me.
I always counted you as a friend.
We have no water.
They are reading their book.
It's my father who stopped drinking.
Be quiet. If you aren't quiet, you'll be thrown out.
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you sooner.
I will make up for the lost time by studying as hard as I can.
The lemon is a sour fruit.
If you can't have children, you could always adopt.
The soldiers laughed.
She's maxed out all her credit cards.
I paid for it already.
I'm an adult.
Let's go to the flea market tomorrow.
They're right behind you.
My feet are always cold.
Judge for yourself.
Tom accepted an expensive gift from Mary.
I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.
I'm departing this evening.
I expected better of Tom.
She is brushing her hair.
It's dangerous to play around the fire.
Our headquarters are in Boston.
Don't move unless I tell you.
The water flooded the streets.
I know that Tom plays the bass.
I have a good feeling about this.
I ripped my pants.
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you sooner.
Tom tells me you're his assistant.
They're almost here.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
Hurry up, girls.
I don't think it's odd.
What shall I do with it?
Can I tell you something very personal?
She found him standing near the entrance.
You should not go alone.
Nobody knew what to say.
I know you're busy, but can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom didn't want to go back to where he was born.
I've got plenty of room.
Is there something that you want to tell me?
Ask them to help.
I want to be noticed.
It's not natural.
I am busy today.
Come back in an hour.
You should not give him up for lost.
I miss you badly.
I thought you already had one.
I myself didn't have to go and meet him there.
The teacher was disappointed at my answer.
Tom asked Mary to go to the supermarket to get some milk.
You're safe here.
Please ask someone else.
It's a tough place to be.
Who owns this house?
Get your hands off me.
What else would you advise?
These flowers grow in warm countries.
Tom doesn't need to apologize. He did nothing wrong.
I want you to go home.
Snakes are cold-blooded creatures.
This room is quiet.
I am taking a holiday at the beach.
Why's your French pronunciation so good?
I lived in poverty.
I'll rip your head off!
A person who steals deserves punishment.
I'm not a kid.
Americans have to spend hours figuring out their taxes.
We danced to the music.
They are still children.
Continue digging.
Are you still afraid?
We used emergency measures to revive the cardiac arrest patient.
She seems friendly.
If you don't leave now, you'll be late.
How thoughtless of you to do that.
I want to stay a few days.
He told me that he was busy.
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
She wept bitterly.
I feel like I'm always being watched.
I brought reinforcements.
When did you buy it? "Let's see. I bought it last week."
This is my natural hair color.
Who wants this?
It's true that he is in love with her.
The weather stayed bad.
We've corrected the situation.
She owes him a lot of money, but she probably won't be able to pay it back.
Tom sat on a stool in the corner.
His life was full of drama.
Keep it together, Tom.
My life was a wreck.
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
How old are your kids?
I'm terrified.
Are you afraid of the future?
I wonder who that lady was.
I wonder why some people think black cats are unlucky.
What do you think of his suggestion?
If you're going to kill me, I want to know why.
Do you understand?
I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
You can't apply this rule to every case.
What's causing that sound?
I asked him to make tea.
Who's at home?
Tom kept singing.
That's a pretty strange-looking bracelet you're wearing.
Are you still on a diet?
I think Tom has a valid point.
I think he won't come.
I'm cold. May I close the window?
We ask the teacher questions every day.
The challenges are enormous.
I'd like to take this with me.
He always plans a thing out carefully before he does it.
After lunch we have two more classes.
I lost a bet.
It happens every day all over the world.
Do you mean you're giving up?
They launched a rocket.
Human relationships are very complex.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
This increase in unemployment is a consequence of the recession.
It is likely to be fine.
Do we have to be so formal?
No one's judging you.
I didn't let Tom kiss me.
I will have finished the work by seven this evening.
They've changed the rules.
My alarm clock didn't work. That's why I was late.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
Last night, we went to the theater.
I like rice more than I like bread.
At last, we reached the summit.
Did you have fun last night?
Feed the hamster.
May I sit next to you?
You're gross!
We spent the day in the open air.
It's very effective.
People used to write books using typewriters.
Do you have any plans for today?
I'm tired of your complaints.
They might be able to help you.
Ask Tom if he's going to the party tonight.
I don't know what I've been so afraid of.
Can I sit here?
I want the work done quickly.
I don't like studying in this heat.
Can you help her out before they catch her?
We agreed on a price.
I'm sick of her excuses.
What was the outcome?
Some students seem to have forgotten to do their homework.
Tom stole my camera.
The girl's parents agreed to her request.
You'll have to do that on your own.
It's nice to be appreciated.
Stars were twinkling in the sky.
You should have been more careful.
He mentioned her name for the first time.
She realized that she had better tell the truth.
Where can I buy a ticket?
Can you do that for all of us?
We came back to camp before dark.
I need you to do it yourself.
She thanked me for the present.
She made up her mind to graduate from high school.
Honesty is a virtue.
I must study.
This is your hat, isn't it?
War is a crime against humanity.
Turn on the lights.
I didn't say a thing.
You'll never be alone.
Tom rinsed his mouth.
There's been a terrible mistake.
I should've done this a long time ago.
I need proof.
I'm shooting.
She asked him if he was a student at this school.
Put this in your backpack.
Are you a criminal?
Did you enjoy the tour?
I've gained weight.
We had a slight difference of opinion.
I want some of those.
What did you want to show me?
There's a church behind my house.
I can't pay you what you're asking.
One of the people you were with is a friend of mine.
I like singing with Tom.
Do you know your blood type?
I know that Tom is almost asleep.
He feels very happy.
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
You betrayed your country.
Sixty percent of Japanese adult males drink alcoholic beverages on a regular basis.
Let's not do anything that might get us in trouble.
I'll have you committed.
They chose me for that.
Being very tired, I went to bed early.
They mistook him for his brother.
Things happen for a reason, right?
He was desperate to get married.
That's ludicrous.
Give me something to write with. "Will this ball-point pen do?"
The ship is not equipped with radar.
Everything worked fine.
He is absorbed in his work.
I'm the boss around here.
It was not my intention.
Don't scare me like that, OK?
I can't do my job without a computer.
I stayed with a friend of mine.
What's the worst injury you've ever had?
Tom isn't paying attention.
How could it not matter?
We took refuge from the storm in a nearby barn.
It did the trick.
Would you like to play tennis every Sunday?
Don't tell me any more lies.
I didn't have enough time to eat everything that was served.
I know how tiring that can be.
Sit wherever you like.
You must study more.
He left for London the day before yesterday.
While there is life, there is hope.
Where are the kids?
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.
She was shocked when she heard his story.
I'm not your husband anymore.
There were 215 votes for the motion and 15 votes against it.
I think I'll go to bed early.
Look at those fish in the pond.
I want this fixed as soon as possible.
Our work is all over now.
Such a person invariably expends his physical energy more slowly.
I remember returning the book to the library.
When were you born?
Can you guess what I have?
Don't you have something to do?
How about playing chess tonight?
I'm pretty proud of that.
I still don't know your name.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
What are you trying to prove?
We managed to get there on time.
What's Tom afraid of?
Of the 23 who were arrested, four escaped.
I'm not going to play this game.
I'm a farmer.
There is a cat under the bed.
Are you seeing anyone?
The river flows into the lake.
Have they made progress?
Do you think Tom saw anything?
Please bring me a cup of tea.
We're not lost.
I heard Tom scream.
He deals in hardware.
Can you make it safe?
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
I will lose weight.
Please refrain from smoking here.
I know Tom is photogenic.
Give me back my pencil.
You're disgusting.
My university has a dorm.
You don't need to say anything.
That sword is fit for a prince.
I'm starting to feel better already.
What is on Channel 10?
Your idea differs entirely from mine.
I should be happy.
I don't care what you think.
Do you recognize that woman?
I hate to be a nuisance.
This is amazing.
Do you have nightmares?
Don't be so hard on me.
I know Tom did that once.
May I see you in private?
I have been on friendly terms with him for more than twenty years.
We haven't yet begun to fight.
I thought we were going to win.
You think you're pretty funny, don't you?
You're acting like a small child.
I thought Tom liked riddles.
Because of the typhoon, the school was closed.
Your conduct is absolutely shameful.
I got first place.
What should I eat?
I won't mention it again.
I forgot what I was going to say.
Can we go over my options?
Tom asked Mary to pass him the gravy.
I don't like fried fish.
Parents need to set the rules around the house.
I want you to be my partner.
I want people to know the truth.
Tom comes from Boston.
Read what's on the label.
She has such beautiful eyes.
I don't really see what the problem is.
Tom isn't going to watch TV.
She has a piano lesson once a week.
Sit down and shut up.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
Could I talk to you in private?
There is to be no fraternizing with the enemy.
How much thinner do you want to be?
Let's not go.
We now know that the testimony he gave was coerced.
This book could be useful to you.
You're the oldest.
Do you mind if I go back to sleep now?
If you touch that wire, you'll get a shock.
I don't care how long ago it was.
Let's all remember to be nice.
I can't be held responsible.
You don't seem to be as organized as Tom seems to be.
Without me, you won't be able to do it.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
They need him.
I sincerely hope things improve for you.
He's not the brightest guy in the world.
I couldn't get him to leave me alone.
The boy feared the dark.
I'll leave it up to your imagination.
How was the food?
Why don't you tell me about it?
Come alone.
She seemed to have been ill.
What's that look like to you?
Are they cops?
I need it as quickly as possible.
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
There's no way to escape.
The teacher can see you.
We need your help to do this.
The experiment seemed to be going well.
Tom can run fast.
I'm not sure I want to do anything.
It must be done more carefully.
Those were the best years of my life.
I warned you not to come here.
My daughter is in her late teens.
He chose them at random.
Can eating just vegetables help you lose weight?
Has Tom noticed yet?
Is he done using the telephone?
They won.
I promised no such thing.
Tom walked across the street.
I haven't received any email today.
I'm no longer tired.
Are you students? "Yes, we are."
He's overconfident.
She was livid when she found out all the lies he'd told her.
I like China.
You should pay attention to his story.
He seems happy.
Could you keep an eye on my suitcase for a few minutes?
Living on a small income is hard.
He thinks he can prove it.
That took real courage.
You don't sound very confident.
Do you have any pets?
The lion is the king of beasts.
I hate it when you pretend like you don't know me.
Tom and Mary are very hungry.
There's a difference.
Are you recording this?
Go and open the door.
Why were you so busy yesterday?
I didn't have lunch today.
Does Tom live here with you?
Tom obeyed.
I have nothing to say in this regard.
I had my doubts from the get-go.
Tom tried to kiss Mary.
We can save you some time.
Do you own a computer?
I'm not young.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
You have many friends.
I like watching people.
Give me thirty seconds.
We become very shorthanded at the end of the year.
The train is traveling at the rate of 50 miles an hour.
Who can tell what will happen in the future?
You're weak.
Why are they doing this to me?
What did I do to deserve this?
I want you to handle it.
He gets up as early as five every morning.
He asked me if I had found it.
How many times did you do that?
I was so humiliated.
I can't live alone.
Take off your socks, please.
Wait till the light turns green.
No one knows where we are.
Either he is wrong or I am.
Nobody equals him in strength.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
You are beautiful.
Tom promised to be here before 2:30.
I know what they are.
I was alone.
Can I touch it?
He's an old timer.
That's just not right.
We waited outside.
I'd like to borrow your car tomorrow.
I told you that was just a joke.
Tom isn't bothering me.
I think she will divorce him.
Who is hungry?
It's really none of your business.
My father gave up smoking for his health.
Tom is taking a shower.
This is the final straw.
I knew you'd like it.
I could barely walk at that time.
She ignored him until he became rich.
All of us stood up.
This sounds like French.
I don't want to deal with this anymore.
We're having lunch.
Who was that who answered your phone?
She is two years younger than me.
My grandfather gets up early.
Your parents are expecting your call.
Earth is a beautiful planet.
He had been there before.
We've an obligation to do that.
I'm motivated.
Tom didn't know anyone in the room.
Catch Tom.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
I'm afraid of not finishing it in time.
You should keep your promises.
I don't recognize that name.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
He sings very well.
Smell this.
There's still a lot to be done.
Tom is obliged to do that.
It's been a week, but I'm still suffering from jet lag.
He has been sick in bed all week.
He assumed full responsibility.
They belong to the chess club.
I know Tom is frightened.
Tom doesn't seem to like me.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I think life is what you make it.
Tom is a good student.
He removed his sunglasses.
Tom came by himself.
I hope you're hungry.
Tom spent thirty days in jail.
This is such a sad story.
You understand me.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I know better than to be believe such a rumor.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
We worked hard on this.
Why did you try to run away?
The kitchen was clean.
I like to dance.
Isn't that what you're here to tell us?
Why are you so busy?
I asked the villagers many times to let me die.
The marauders laid waste to the town and surrounding villages.
I've lived a long time.
I want to discuss this with your manager.
I've never even had a girlfriend.
You might as well read a novel instead of staring at the ceiling.
Furthermore, I still don't think this a huge cultural difference.
I said thanks.
I'm trying to talk to you.
He retired at sixty.
You're good.
A lot has changed since then.
Maybe I should study German.
I found it.
I know I'm alone on this.
I have a cold.
I'm observant.
Make your move.
As always, he got up early in the morning and went jogging.
He grew up in a small town.
What is that?
They did it in front of the staff.
What are you doing, Dad?
It was everything he hoped for.
Smoking is bad for your health.
We should wait here for the moment.
You're not helping, Tom.
Have you been drinking?
It's only a fifteen minute bus ride from here to the airport.
This paragraph is well written, but there is a mistake in the last sentence.
I have been to the airport to see my friend off.
I made a paper plane.
How are you connected?
I'm just not very busy.
I have some idea of what happened.
There is no point in pretending to be sick.
Your house is nicer than mine.
Could you please sharpen these knives?
Thank you for doing that for me.
We didn't plan this.
I know that Tom isn't stupid.
My greatest ambition is to be an opera singer.
Read this first.
There was blood on the carpet.
I figured you should know.
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry.
Tom's funny.
By the way, I think you're really nice.
Give me a second.
Hokkaido is to the north of Honshu.
Tom didn't arrive until it was already too late.
I know how busy you are.
Go with Tom.
The cat is on the roof.
You're very astute.
Tom is just curious.
I need Tom's help.
This makes me sad.
How could we have not seen that?
Which one will you choose?
Tom felt a little nauseated.
I don't like such sports as tennis and golf.
Why did he do such a thing?
Why didn't you wake me up?
They tried to discourage him from going.
Does this hurt?
She is always trying to please him.
Don't make me go.
I could find his address.
Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him where I'd gone.
We only have three bicycles.
The hunter shot a bear.
Tom and Mary are playing chess.
I know what it feels like.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
I've been following you.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
These two leaves look alike.
I missed the two o'clock plane.
Tom is at home alone.
I don't want to fail my exams.
I want to go to Australia with my family.
He doesn't care if his car is dirty.
What should I eat for lunch today?
It would be crazy not to do that.
I didn't shower.
He was sent into combat.
A lot of people feel the same way you do.
He goes to Karuizawa every year.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
I like to travel alone.
The floor had a good shine.
We're standing.
Why did Tom cancel his trip?
Both of them seem suspicious.
I went there out of curiosity.
I wish you could come with us.
I suppose I'd better leave.
Let's go on a road trip.
I know Tom is a bit chubby.
God sent a sign.
You're not allowed in here.
We like to learn foreign languages.
I hope you're well paid.
The bridge is approximately a mile long.
You can go to the station by bus.
You're not special.
You're disgusting.
Where is the south terminal?
The painting is not worth the price you are asking.
Why don't we go ahead and start the meeting?
I wasn't trying to hurt anybody.
Please turn on the radio.
They showed it to our company.
The cash machine is out of order.
That's enough for today.
My sister resembles my grandmother.
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
These are the shoes I bought last week.
I don't often get invited to parties.
That's too good to be true.
Caution is advised.
It was his fault.
He never speaks English without making a few mistakes.
Did it hurt?
The roses are in bloom in our garden.
I anticipated his question.
I don't know what else we can do.
You never tell me anything.
Are you sure that's safe?
I think perhaps I can help Tom.
He is not man to lose heart at a single failure.
Why go to all that trouble?
Don't make such careless mistakes.
Forget it. It's too risky.
Do you want to get us both killed?
A long time ago, people didn't live very long.
I was just leaving home then.
They were all here.
I'm eating a sandwich.
I always wanted to be different.
Mary looks like her mother, but her personality is different.
Mary is as pretty as her sister.
You must start immediately.
Father went to a lot of trouble to prepare dinner for our guests.
He touched me.
Everyone was doing it.
Everything is different now.
How many cars have you owned so far?
Are you sure you're warm enough?
We can't let them do that.
I buy loads of stuff at that store.
He's an opera lover.
I can look into this for you.
That's enough.
I need to meet your boss.
I want to have a word with Tom.
A hundred years have passed since the Titanic sank.
He is hated by everyone.
Do you ask every new employee that question?
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me that I'm in love.
Let's do it again.
They missed Tom.
For three weeks, he ate nothing at all.
Tom doesn't like snails.
I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
Which road should I take?
I don't want to be late for work.
Did you catch the first train?
He caught a big one.
I learned something today.
How am I supposed to eat?
He is a typical Japanese.
He is present at the meeting.
Did you forget to do your homework?
I'm not dying.
You're elusive.
I can't blame him.
You are not Japanese.
Will you show me your passport, please?
Where is the bathroom?
You will know the truth some day.
Tom respects everyone.
How much are they offering?
We cannot afford it.
Don't touch that dial.
I didn't do this, did I?
An expensive car is a status symbol.
Where is the cathedral located?
We mean you no harm.
A teenager sometimes acts like a baby.
Adding comments makes reading the code easier.
Don't touch anything.
Why did you turn away when you met him?
We could read.
We didn't want to get in your way.
Are you unlucky?
I'll never be able to forget Tom.
It has a leak.
My sister belonged to the basketball club last year.
Many people believe that.
Cats can see even in dark places.
Don't worry about it.
Sit right there.
They made me go there.
He's afraid of the sea.
The instinct for survival is innate.
What is your problem?
Tom's married.
I knew you'd come back to me.
How did you get hurt?
This could take a while.
I heard you paid a visit to Tom.
Stop speaking in riddles.
What a fool I've been!
That pasture is ten acres.
They're kind of fun.
She's strong-willed.
Tom turned on the lamp.
He was very busy all day.
I thought I told you not to do that in here.
What options do I have left?
You should apologize.
We're all scared.
I thought we should leave.
I don't have time to deal with this letter. Could you deal with it?
I got out of the car at 40th Street.
You may want to take a few steps back.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
You're in luck. The plane is on time.
What do you like to read?
How many books have you read?
Which team won?
Do you know where I live?
We'll miss you.
I bet you're a great teacher.
They hated each other.
Not all of us can speak English.
Why did Tom call?
I hadn't planned to tell you about what happened last night.
I didn't vote for anyone.
Don't make such a racket!
Accidents happen.
I like red wine better than white.
He works for a large American corporation.
What were you doing in that building?
My room has two windows.
Our car ran out of gas after ten minutes.
Could I have money for my piano lesson?
They died one after another.
Shut up!
Why would you want to do that?
I know an English teacher who comes from Canada.
I know that Tom is a jerk.
Tom took good care of everyone.
I apologized profusely.
I've upset you.
I was so drunk last night.
Eleven o'clock is good for me.
Tom is your older brother, isn't he?
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
I like it when you sing.
They lost again.
I think they're using you.
I can't bear to be doing nothing! you often hear people say.
Summer is almost here.
The job offer still stands.
What's the saddest movie you've ever seen?
She wouldn't go for a walk with him.
I brought you red roses.
Be sensible.
The sisters hate each other.
I got home a little late last night.
I'll clean it up.
We've looked at a lot of things.
Tom got first prize, didn't he?
I'm not going to waste time.
She buys what she wants regardless of the cost.
You're the prisoner.
There must be another way.
They had no beards, no hair and no eyebrows.
She advises me on technical matters.
I will stop him from going.
Here's my room.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
The mountain is covered with snow.
What a lucky person he is!
I saw you.
I know Tom is fast.
I drank beer out of a plastic cup.
There may be others.
Where can I leave my bike?
What you've done is absolutely inexcusable.
I think Tom did a really nice job.
It'll definitely rain.
I'm not good at it.
I heard from someone that she got married.
Would he like that?
Live free or die.
I had no idea we had so much in common.
I know exactly what I should do.
I'm going to deal with the problem in this chapter.
Give me a piece of chalk.
We want you to take it.
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
This park is a paradise for children.
She was so angry that she could not speak.
You misunderstood me.
The spectators cheered the players on.
I said he could go.
Don't read that kind of book.
There wasn't a soul in sight.
Does this book belong to you?
Do you know what she said?
Many cancer patients lose their hair because of the chemotherapy.
Here is some water.
Please give me a pencil and some sheets of paper.
It's just a piece of paper.
He made mistake after mistake.
Don't be sad.
She advised him not to drink too much.
Tom and I'll do all we can.
Tom couldn't believe what had happened.
You can borrow an umbrella if you need one.
You could've ruined everything.
That makes perfect sense to me.
Why didn't you come earlier?
I promise you won't be disappointed.
He promised to provide information.
One of my wisdom teeth is coming in.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
I could barely contain my excitement.
Do you feel lucky?
I love the way you laugh.
It's all our fault.
Let me buy you another one.
She used to help him with his homework.
Tom's alone.
I can't leave now.
This tree is older than that car.
When do you study?
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
Where did you buy this book?
She hit him with a hammer.
I pulled an all-nighter preparing for the exam.
Tom never trusted Mary.
Could you send someone up to make the bed?
You're giving me the same old line.
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't speak French.
He often attributes his success to his wife.
He asked the lady standing next to him some questions.
Have you seen my coat?
Are you certain that's what you want?
Did you get it?
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
They announced that they were going to have a party.
You lied to Tom.
This house is mine.
Tom was trying to control his anger.
How long did it take Tom to build the doghouse?
We're sloshed.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
I wonder what that is.
I like to sing.
What is it?
I've tried to talk to Tom.
I've something interesting to tell you that you might find surprising.
Feeling chilly, I turned on the heater.
Tell me which of the two cameras is the better one.
I've never lied to you.
What are you eating right now?
I lack imagination.
I accept the risk.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
The age of nuclear power is not yet over.
Are you sure you aren't cold?
Do you plan on moving?
Are you sure they can do this?
It'll be hard to persuade Tom.
Where's there a supermarket around here?
Do you want to tell me what this is?
The plan is not yet finalized.
I'll call him.
I like being a teacher.
Do you know who conquered Mt. Everest first?
Am I seeing things?
I don't think I want to answer any more of your questions right now.
The capital of Japan is Tokyo.
I'd rather walk.
I guess that's all I need.
Are you ready?
Even chocolate contains vitamins.
How did you lose your arm?
I need you here.
Don't bring your dog with you.
Tom wants people to pity him.
He wants to learn to swim.
He's a bit naive.
I'd be depressed if they asked me to quit the team.
That's the only thing that's important.
Do it again!
We need to burn all this stuff before the police get here.
I still need to talk to Tom.
That might be difficult.
Tom will be here tonight.
I know you feel lonely.
I am proud of being a doctor.
We grow vegetables in our garden.
You look upset.
I'll lend you my textbook if you promise not to write anything in it.
Where's my mother?
He went there by himself.
They climbed down the tree.
I don't really have a choice.
There was no warning whatsoever.
Was that an insult?
He was so busy that he sent his son instead of going himself.
Tom wants to become a fireman.
We need only a few more minutes.
Tom doesn't need to worry about Mary.
You three are under arrest.
She heard him cry.
The weather is threatening.
They were all actors.
They made sure nobody could see them.
The baby is able to walk.
We had a storm yesterday.
You're a good boy.
You seem a little depressed.
Tom is a gourmet.
I really don't understand what's so funny.
Come on, try again.
He noticed straight away.
He quietly knocked at the door.
I want to say goodbye.
Tom wasn't thinking straight.
I'll check your vision.
You're greedy.
This problem is difficult to solve.
This is never going to end.
He pinched me!
Do you have anything to do tonight?
He didn't say a word.
Do you know why Tom didn't win?
They're waiting for you.
You are taller than she is.
I'm going to jump.
Let's take a bus.
I have a pen pal in Australia.
Tom played with his cats.
I don't have any choice.
Shouldn't we report this?
He likes games of chance.
I wish somebody would tell me what to do.
Many lost their homes in the earthquake.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Please sing.
Are you lonely?
Have you been told the reasons why we didn't hire you?
He stole a glance at the girl.
It's raining cats and dogs.
Sooner or later, we all are going to die.
You've been infected.
Everyone knows that.
She had the decency to apologize.
I expected this.
Tell Tom that I won't be there.
They can manage.
The rumor quickly spread.
He might have been sleeping at that time.
An apple sits on the table.
The baby seemed to be fast asleep.
Am I correct?
The removal of the load-bearing beam compromised the structure of the building.
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than to get permission.
What's your excuse?
Tom tried not to look at Mary.
Could you get in touch with him?
If your feet get wet, you'll catch a cold.
Aren't you even going to ask me where I was?
He's offered to help.
She never wears green.
He is a doctor.
I'm not ignoring you.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Go to the hospital.
The ice melted.
You recognize him, don't you?
I hope you'll like it.
Do you know a good dentist?
If I were you, I'd study harder.
In addition to a thick fog, there was a heavy swell.
This spoon is for tea.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you really think we'll find Tom?
I am worried about my mother's health.
Tom was a little overweight when he was a child.
I can't run as fast as you.
What's your mom's name?
I stop here to eat once or twice a week.
I had to see you again.
I'm sorry, we're completely sold out.
Would it be all right if I visited you today?
You didn't tell me everything.
Watch the prisoner.
I don't know if I can do it.
There's nothing down here.
Let's go outside and play.
I'm not going anywhere.
I need a pencil sharpener.
I helped you when you needed help.
I just don't want to die.
This isn't legal.
I'll understand if you don't want to go there with me.
We talked.
I think you're putting in too much sugar.
They had good chemistry.
That happens every day, doesn't it?
Tom went to the park by himself.
What made you ask that?
We're through.
Waiter, I need a spoon.
My mother said that she was all right.
I lit the oven.
I'd like to go to the mall.
Do your parents speak French?
I didn't even notice you.
I'll forgive you.
He was outraged.
Tom and Mary looked at each other uneasily.
He has some knowledge of editing.
I've done this a thousand times.
I have some pictures to show you.
You can still go if you want to.
Even Tom was surprised.
Tom wanted to talk about something else.
I caught him cheating on the test.
Sleep tight.
Aren't you surprised to see me?
Of course, he is right.
Tom asked us several questions.
Tom washed the apple before he ate it.
You drive a hard bargain.
Tom didn't know whether he should do that or not.
I did everything I could.
This is the village where I was born.
My joints ache.
He dug a hole.
I just want everybody to live.
Tom died at a very old age.
He had his sister help him paint the wall of his room.
I think I can prove it.
Are you asking me on a date?
I asked him if he knew her address.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
Everything is better without you.
I can prove it to you.
The fish smells bad.
I really am glad you're here.
I've already found somebody to do that job.
May I turn down the TV?
I'm sure I've seen him before.
Tom has his father's eyes.
I want to sleep in my own bed tonight.
The best player of all times was Pelé.
I can't get rid of my cold.
This camera was made in Germany.
He majors in English literature.
Tom was really crazy.
Either come in or go out.
That sounded like a gunshot.
She approached him with a smile on her face.
Nature is scary.
We don't want anyone getting hurt.
You should apologize to her for being so distant.
I couldn't have done that by myself.
Do you think you can manage to keep things going until I get back?
Tom will always remember you.
Tom eventually gave up.
I think we're done.
As time went on, the sky grew darker and darker.
She likes going to the library.
Don't come back until you've done what I've asked you to do.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
Tom had a knife in his hand.
Tom has made a good suggestion.
But we don't have anything in common at all.
She just wrote a book.
Of course Tom didn't come.
Don't waste your time thinking about it.
Do you go there often?
What's it doing out here?
What kind of person do you think I am?
How long have you been in Japan?
How many times have you been there?
When you think about it that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
I don't need your job.
Do you think you and I are compatible?
My wife beats me.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
Are you dating anybody?
I require advice.
You're free to go.
How do you intend to do it?
We met today.
That's your favorite, right?
You should do all you can to help your neighbours.
Are you really going to let Tom go there by himself?
I have absolute confidence in your judgement.
Was that an insult?
Cows give milk.
Why did you guys break up?
What are these? "They are your pictures."
We'll be happy to help.
You're crafty.
She doesn't admit that she is wrong.
We made a deal.
He's the new CEO from the parent company in France.
How many counties are there in Florida?
I hate that you have to leave.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Are you on your way home?
You don't have to be so rude.
We're going to be aggressive.
The government should do away with these regulations.
Nobody knows why he left the town.
I try not to bother anyone.
My book is here.
When will you ever learn?
The engineer told us how to use the machine.
Don't use too much glue.
You seem really busy this morning.
I believe you'll get over it soon.
My father had once been in Greece.
I left my jacket in the classroom.
Doing that is very important.
I could hear everything the president said.
This is a portrait of my late father.
What's new?
I saved you.
I never told you to quit.
Carbon monoxide is a poisonous substance formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon compounds.
I won't do that.
Tom and Mary said they were worried.
Now let's celebrate.
You can't tell anyone about this.
He fell down on the ice and hurt his leg.
I find this difficult to believe.
Tom made quite a lot of money in his twenties.
I like this neighborhood.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
Give me two minutes.
Tom plays the guitar better than anyone else I know.
Did Tom ask you to do it?
Lets play video games or something.
I really appreciate your coming.
I've broken enough rules for one day.
She took her book.
I didn't want to bug you.
Bread is made from wheat.
Do you know whose handwriting this is?
I knew it would be easy.
You didn't tell me Tom smoked.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
Thank you for your time.
How much money did you win?
She approached him with a smile on her face.
I don't like goat cheese.
You were at home yesterday, weren't you?
Her vital signs are being closely monitored.
I don't have a girlfriend.
It's very close.
I want you to help.
I'm going to hurt you.
The sandwiches were delicious.
I've upset you.
My hair is a mess.
This dog is yours.
Why don't you quit?
We must succeed.
To tell the truth, I don't like him.
This is his fault.
You seem to know everything about this.
Do you have to go now?
I found it necessary to ask for help.
We're so proud of you!
Why don't you try a different tack?
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
I didn't graduate.
I realized what was happening.
I didn't hear a word of what Tom just said.
Tom declined to comment.
I'll need to run some more tests.
He landed a big trout.
It's the only logical explanation.
I'm not speaking to you.
I play bass in a jazz band.
I don't know what to do here.
It seems he's still alive.
I didn't know Tom was here.
Tom helped Mary open the crate.
I'm not presentable.
Easy does it.
He had an interview with the Prime Minister.
I enjoy traveling.
Electronic components can be cleaned by using pure isopropyl alcohol.
Would you like to take a recess?
A dog bit her leg.
Did anybody see what happened?
I had no idea you were involved.
I'm focusing on my job.
When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person.
Outside advice may be necessary.
She's a very interesting person.
They don't know about it.
Why did Tom want to talk to Mary?
Tom is writing to a friend.
Who's your father?
He loves going to the theater.
I couldn't control myself.
It's happening all over again.
I sure wish I could speak French better.
I was happy to hear the news.
You're so talented.
The 9:35 train stops at Bambury.
I'll be staying here for another three days.
Last winter, I went skiing in Canada.
A bird can glide through the air without moving its wings.
That wasn't nice.
Are you on crack?
Tom is thirsty.
I think that we should stop doing that.
If I were you, I'd ask him.
The group was made up of six girls and four guys.
This conversation never happened.
Can you promise me you won't tell Tom?
I'm not uncomfortable.
I really want to figure this out.
He was playing tennis all day.
Take a look at that.
Tom built a raft.
I'll leave it up to you.
The aim is to be out of the country within the hour.
Are dogs more intelligent than cats?
He had nothing to say, so he left.
Do you like summer?
How big will it be?
I'll sit with Tom.
I really misjudged you.
You're too skinny.
Do you know the town where he lives?
I'm sorry that I broke my promise.
I'll talk with you about that later.
We're going to do everything we can.
Guess what I found on the beach.
Why don't you remember?
Tom refused to sign his name.
I don't like it at all.
It isn't just for show.
It was just a lucky guess.
Hey, what are you talking about?
She is rather poor at tennis.
Casinos treat high rollers like kings.
This is all I can do for you.
He is in good physical condition.
I'd appreciate your help.
I want to know where you heard that.
I hear the phone.
Tom died on Monday in Boston.
He has enough willpower.
Nuts are nutritious.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
Wait here until I come back.
This medicine will reduce the pain.
His way of speaking offended me.
The identity of the boy who had been missing was verified by the clothes he was wearing.
Are you all completely crazy?
Promise me that you won't sell your guitar to anyone but me.
She fell in love with him.
I'm not going to help you.
When did you learn how to swim?
You have to see it.
You killed my mother.
We're out of time.
Will you go?
I didn't order dinner.
I need you now.
This is excellent wine.
Tom sat alone with a half-empty bottle of wine.
Don't start doing that.
All I ask is that you show up on time.
You're stupid to trust him.
Japan today is not what it was even ten years ago.
I'm sorry, but I can't lend you my car next weekend.
He swam until he could swim no more.
I told Tom I couldn't do that.
Are you afraid of silence?
I don't like this weather.
Is this wine?
Tom was my first boss.
You're not bruised.
I must object.
Experience is the best teacher.
Leaving something unfinished is the worst thing you can do.
This TV was made in China.
Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't want him at her party.
He is the man you can rely on.
I need someone now.
She blamed him for all her problems.
I forgot it in the garage.
I like the way you treat me.
What language do you speak at home?
He knows about the modern history of France.
Are you falling for me?
I trusted you.
I must remember to write that down.
Are you sure this is the right train?
Is this your money?
I was your babysitter when you were a kid.
Are you for or against his idea?
He tried in vain to pull the wool over my eyes.
They went to the beach.
It tasted sweet.
She is a good English speaker.
Where are your parents now?
I have read this book before.
That's pretty much everything you need to know.
Which one of these boxes do you want?
Here we are!
Did you turn the stove off?
There were flowers all around.
I was able to answer all the questions.
Tom most certainly would not approve.
There is no other choice.
Tom must be furious.
I know a lot about environmental problems.
They're all bad.
I've made a list of foods that I can't eat.
The buildings are small in comparison with the skyscrapers in New York.
I don't remember it at all.
That's really a great idea.
We just got here.
Do you think that'll happen soon?
Please deposit the money in a bank.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
I've learned to live with the pain in my back.
Mary isn't like the other girls.
How will you change this?
Has your dog ever bitten you?
She was reading a gardening manual.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
I'm very happy to be back home.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
This one is prettier.
I walked in the woods by myself.
I have something to show you.
He's a great kisser.
Tom may not be as happy as he seems.
I'll make a few calls.
Which is your favorite team?
Tom has a tattoo on his left arm.
I'd like to help you get what you need.
Men and women went into battle.
We've just finished breakfast.
I am doing my homework.
I have seen him once on the train.
I just did what anybody would've done.
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
She took a job in a store for the summer.
He has a square jaw.
That won't work!
What do you do when you're not at work?
I'd like you to look after my dog while I'm away.
We're going inside.
She studies hard.
Do you know who lives in that house?
Tom is very efficient.
It has happened before.
We're just going to talk.
Do you fly frequently?
She has remained abroad ever since.
That's happening far too often.
I doubt that Tom is still single.
I need a good lawyer.
Tom didn't do that very much.
I owe two months' rent for my room.
She's an angel.
They need the money.
Are you leaving now?
We didn't help Tom escape.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
I'm a total wreck.
I love a happy ending.
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
He cooked me dinner.
Please give me what I want.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
I'm thinking about putting my house up for sale.
I came here to save you.
This is a good deal.
I don't care if it's a bit cold.
He was elected mayor again.
He is generally at home in the evening.
You don't really mean it, do you?
Could you give me a second?
What's the longest word in French?
The two families live under one roof.
You were my friend.
You don't have to go.
This year, the winter is mild, isn't it? It's very nice.
May I call you tonight? "Sure."
Be more careful from now on.
I don't think they allow that.
I go jogging.
You had better ask him in advance how much it will cost.
I won't sign this.
Stir the soup.
I got a traffic ticket.
We'll wait here.
She is interested in music.
Don't you dare touch anything.

He's very influential in the world of medicine.
He keeps a diary.
I'm hungry.
I'm not the problem.

I know that would make you happy.
I made these boxes myself.
This is getting weirder.
That river is dangerous to swim in.
I want to see your house.

Somebody's taken Tom's place.
Do you know where the others are?
What are you sitting on?
Are you saying you can't fix it?
What's your name again?
What are you trying to prove?
You're impatient.
I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.
Tom isn't really in love with Mary.
I need an extra pillow.
I just don't want to overdo it.
I truly hope not.
You should not go there.

I want to go to sleep soon because I need to get up early tomorrow.
I know that I can fix it.
There is not much hope.
Let's make sure.
Are you in favor of this motion?
She mistook me for my brother.

We're gonna have a lot of fun.
What they wanted was a man like himself.
We saw the tower in the distance.
I don't see any problem.
Are you really sick?
I remember seeing you last year.
Hold the line, please.
I am at home every evening.
That was the most interesting film that we had ever seen.

I don't plan on telling you anything.
Are you happy?
The statue has no head.
They had trouble finding the place.

We're not used to it.

Look at this mess.
You must run.
I just want to hear your reasons.

I remember hearing this tune before.
I'm able to swim.
Of course, I feel guilty.
Who recommended that?
We need your help to do this.
I feel lost without you.
I had a job when I was your age.
The bullet penetrated his chest, leaving him in critical condition.
The hours are terrible.
Women are beautiful.
How can you be so sure?

Nobody really knows.
Should I go or would you like me to stay?
Can I carry this on the plane?
I laughed in spite of myself.

Keep up with the times.
We can't turn back now.

What you're doing right now is a crime.
I haven't eaten for many days.
They got married.
Do you want this room painted, too?
Stay and have a cup of coffee with me.

We'll get you a place to stay.
Telling lies is a very bad habit.
Tom and Mary don't really have much in common.
That's the reason I'm here.

You won't need that.
The tank is full.
I know Tom is a movie buff.
Do you know the man that's staring at you?
Tom is preparing dinner.
Tom claimed to be Mary's son.
How do you do this?
I know it isn't the truth.
My grandfather was a miller.
After I graduated from college, I got a job with my father's company.
Tom says he doesn't know what to do.
Things aren't always as they appear.
I had expected him at the meeting.
She mended her socks.
Everyone in the class climbed the hill.

Murder is punishable by death.
You're in luck.
I would've drowned if you hadn't saved me.

If you could come, I'd be really happy.
I promise you I'll look after you.
I was just unlucky.
I don't need to be lectured by you.
Don't drink the tap water.
The first thing you have to take into consideration is time.
Get the door, will you?
They tried to escape.
He breathed deeply.
It's not much of a surprise, is it?
I don't like your taste in colors.
He achieved his aim at last.
Please smile.
This will be a great opportunity.
It was seven thirty.
Tom poured milk into a bowl for his cat.
Should I leave a message?
Nobody could explain how the thing was made.
You have a point there.
This puzzle has 500 pieces.
I have tried everything.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I had a nightmare about vampires.
Did Tom ever tell you how he first met Mary?
You're the tallest person here.
Could you please stop saying that?
Do you know how much that car cost me?
Would you like something easier?
What kind of food do you usually eat?
How is it going?
Get that thing off of me.
I really like French cooking.
I've already hidden the diamonds.
I thought we had eaten everything in the house, but I found another box of crackers.
I worked hard to succeed.
Would you like to take a recess?
I have some stuff to do at home.
I'm not exactly sure.
Are you still hungry?
How many people are on board the ship?
That's exactly how I feel.
Look at that picture.
Gulliver's Travels was written by a famous English writer.
The dog was hit by a car.
Living here isn't easy.
There was nothing left to do.
Perhaps Tom is guilty.
He laid out this garden.
Feed the bird!
I think we'll all feel better once we get a little sleep.
I caught Tom looking into the neighbors' windows.
They went there.
You must do this alone.
I thought you were serious.
Don't you know how?
You don't need luck.
I returned the knife that I borrowed.
You'll want to see this.
He betrayed my confidence.
Carry these books back to the bookshelf.
You're making a huge mistake.
What is it?
He went over to the other side.
I haven't found my keys yet.
I did nothing during the holidays.
Let me call my lawyer.
I don't feel very happy.
The apples from the tree behind Tom's house are very delicious.
Do you remember?
I can't reach things on the top shelf.
If you act like that, he'll think you hate him.
Do you think it's my fault?
We have a reservation.
A high proportion of crime in any country is perpetrated by young males in their teens and twenties.
He does not listen.
I'd like to see you try it.
She often eats breakfast there.
The snowstorm raged for a full week.
I already did that twice today.
I stood up, but not for long.
I still believe in love.
Tom knows why nobody came to his party.
The king once lived in that palace.
Doing that could be dangerous.
He lost his life in a traffic accident.
I should've thought of that.
This gate needs painting.
What would your father think?
I'm giving it back.
I don't like this camera.
We shouldn't resort to violence.
I know you're angry with me.
She suggested that I should clean the bathroom.
I couldn't be happier for the two of you.
Did anyone see you there?
Do you like to be kept waiting?
I'm so proud of my team.
He collected bits of information.
I don't know what to do from now on.
You know I can't.
I'm really busy today, otherwise I would accept.
Do you want some sugar in your coffee?
I don't speak your language.
She urged him to consider the request.
You'll bounce back.
How can I deactivate my account on this site?
Lightning does sometimes strike the same place twice.
What a heavy bag!
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
You're the experts.
That goes without saying.
Look at that pole in the square.
I'm doing this for you.
Who will you be coming with?
I want a picture of that dog.
I don't want to hear another word.
Don't stay up all night.
I can wait no longer.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
She wore a red scarf around her neck.
They won't have arrived yet.
I feel bad about it.
How far away is the library?
I thought she was sick.
There's something funny going on here.
He gave me a smile of recognition.
I don't steal.
We looked at each other.
Did I tell you that?
Tom sighed.
They're very close friends.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
He looks strong.
I've been badly bitten by mosquitoes.
Tom said Mary was tempted to eat the last piece of cake, but left it for him.
The bar was so smoky that my eyes started to sting.
You did the right thing.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
That's not a good choice.
I always travel with travelers' checks instead of cash.
You can sit down if you want.
You've got to be bold!
I have to talk to you alone.
Tom says he won't get married to Mary.
I thought about all the times we used to play together as kids.
I hate them all.
Are you still sleepy?
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
Tom often wears tie-dyed T-shirts.
Stay here with us.
I can't describe how I felt.
It's a matter of priorities.
The story ends happily.
Do you want to bet on that?
This may be research my secretary did.
You're a traitor.
I'm sure everything will be OK.
Why don't we all eat together?
He is no longer a child.
I don't understand why you want it.
I just want to forget about it.
Tom won't leave until he's talked to Mary.
You know very well how it happened.
Tom waited for Mary to answer.
Dad painted the walls white.
You're the teacher.
We want to go.
I'm familiar with the situation.
Do you want me to walk you home?
He got lost while he was walking in the woods.
Nobody cares about me.
Speak slowly, please.
I'll call if I learn anything.
I'm not comparing Tom to Mary.
I never thought Tom would hit Mary.
I'll be thirty this October.
No matter what happens, you must be here by nine.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
We are going to the country.
I love winning.
Let me see it.
He answered all the questions in ten minutes.
I know you'd prefer a bottle of red wine.
You make me laugh a lot.
She was watching the dead leaves falling.
I don't like to take on the heavy responsibilities.
I think he's right.
He cleared his throat.
Do you have something to show me?
That's all you need to know.
I have a train to catch.
That's the one.
He felt uneasy in his father's presence.
I'm being honest with you.
When will your new novel come out?
I'll never leave you alone again.
I feel the same.
I got my hands quite dirty.
Was that you on TV last night?
Tom brings me to the office every morning.
My father abandoned me when I was young.
How did you get so good at French?
She waited for him to come home.
He likes watching TV.
Tom is eager to talk to Mary.
It looks like we might have to do that.
The king went hunting this morning.
Do you know which book sells well now?
Would you mind if I changed seats now?
Thank you for your help.
What a great idea!
I'm just trying to survive.
Salaries have increased.
I thought you wouldn't mind waiting for me.
I went there yesterday.
What time is it now?
I did you a favor.
Can I kiss you?
Be fair.
It was not very cold yesterday.
Could you actually eat this?
Why do I have to know this stuff?
He felt himself growing old.
You look very tired.
That should take about thirty minutes.
I wanted to make you feel at home.
You're the one who trained me.
I will probably get up early tomorrow.
Take as much as you want.
Where did you get the money to buy that dress?
We're out of danger.
He lost sight of his friend in the crowd.
Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
There was a church here once.
Tom took a quick shower.
We've known her for many years.
She wanted to understand.
It's early.
I'll leave this with you.
I am peeling apples.
The word has several meanings.
Don't say a word to anyone.
I just want to thank you.
I thought you'd enjoy this.
I know that Tom is a spy.
She is strong.
I'm old enough to live by myself.
Tom put his bag under the table.
I opened a bottle of red wine.
I took him a cup of coffee.
Let's make a phone call.
That was mean.
She's eating for two.
Spanish is spoken in most countries of South America.
Stay very still.
She disguised herself as him.
Let me show you an example.
That's one of them.
This isn't a safe place.
My feelings for you haven't changed.
What have we got?
The clock stopped. It needs a new battery.
He lost his job.
Everyone's going to be tired.
Her husband also wanted custody of the children.
Tom knew that he'd been tricked.
He is walking very slowly.
What do you think you'll do next?
The Prime Minister has resigned.
She surprised him when she arrived early.
How did he find us?
Do you have a cellphone?
She talked to the chairperson.
You have chosen the best.
We'll make up for the loss.
Can I have one?
I like him.
You shouldn't judge a person by his looks.
How many people do you think we should invite to our party?
He is thick-headed.
I sure do hope so.
Your necklace is beautiful.
I'm proud of you all.
Nobody likes war.
The letter was signed by Tom.
Is the battery fully charged?
This is the first time I've written a letter in German.
The house needs a new coat of paint.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
Which is your suitcase?
Everyone should be able to express their opinion.
I'm sure you never told me not to do this.
She made him cry.
Tom doesn't sleep much.
I don't have the authority to do that.
That's what Tom wants to know.
Tom is taking care of that.
Compared to our house, yours is a palace.
The flower pot crashed to the sidewalk.
She knit him a sweater for his birthday.
I'm jittery.
Is ten thousand yen enough?
I'm not staying.
You've been warned.
You said you were going to handle it.
Tom's book was translated into French.
Look at that!
Please excuse my being late.
Tom plays golf every weekend.
I never had the opportunity to use it.
She wept bitterly.
Which of you will go?
He doesn't stand a chance against his opponent.
When did you guys decide this?
He gave her a piece of advice.
Pinocchio had a long nose.
Do you swim often?
What makes you think that Tom will listen to me?
I don't really want to talk about that.
I drank more than I was planning to.
I really like being with you.
How did you get so good at French?
Tom is all alone.
Let me ask you a question.
He was not at all satisfied with the result.
I give up.
Don't slam the door.
The airport was closed because of the fog.
I felt myself being lifted up.
Are you sure you can handle this?
I can't eat pork.
She waved goodbye to him.
Did you go to Nikko yesterday?
She always clears the table after a meal.
He put a hand gently on her shoulder.
Please make the bed.
I really miss you all.
Are the children already asleep?
I'll tell you a secret.
What caused the war?
We met last week.
I was humiliated.
Which one of you two are coming with me?
I used to keep a diary.
I'm not from around here.
They shouldn't let children swim in that river.
May I turn on the radio?
What song is this?
Is your watch correct?
I saw tears in his eyes.
I didn't want to look stupid.
We need to go shopping.
As a matter of fact, she is my sister.
I almost passed out.
I want to hear everything.
What was all this about?
When do you go on vacation?
She does not like him.
I sent it to you two days ago.
They just want to get to know you.
This is a lot more fun than studying.
Tom didn't warn me about what might happen.
I'm the happiest man in the world.
The doctor took my pulse.
You don't have to wait until the end.
Is the museum open today?
I can't show you.
Are all of them your friends?
I've got all the time in the world.
She doesn't admit that she is in the wrong.
Can you tell us what Tom did?
Everyone survived.
I unloaded the car.
What happened to your guitar?
I tried to take our dog out of our house.
You can take it.
Do you want to eat this?
The drunk driver had to spend the night in jail.
Tom is the one who doesn't understand.
I didn't want to spend any more time in jail.
Smoking is not permitted here.
This is against the law.
Tom stayed in Boston for three days.
I need to go shopping.
It's going to rain soon. Look at those black clouds.
It may rain this afternoon.
We're conducting a survey.
He is eager to go there.
That wasn't my intent.
As you climb higher, the air becomes colder.
Do you live alone?
Rainy season begins in June.
We spent hours looking for it.
Let's take that chance.
The car ran into a tree.
Go to school.
Are there any bananas?
I want to know more about you, Tom.
I don't have to wear glasses any more.
I won't do that unless you want me to.
Long skirts are in fashion.
We're done talking.
I wonder if he's really sick.
It's a little complicated.
He spends all his time chatting online on Jabber.
Do you like my T-shirt?
Tom bought a house with a magnificent view of the sea.
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
We didn't have time to do that.
Tom is eating.
Prices went up.
Tom isn't sure he wants to do this.
All of a sudden, Tom and I were alone.
We spent more money than was expected.
Have you fed the dog?
I think he regrets having divorced his wife.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
It was probably not true.
Did you guess the end of the story?
Is there any likelihood of his coming?
Six o'clock will suit me very well.
I should've known.
Tom poured a cup of tea for Mary.
I have wine.
I can't show you.
Who's this guy?
Says who? "Says me."
Don't forget to floss.
You're running out of options.
He's young and attractive.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
Which online dictionary do you use most?
May I ask you to call me back later?
A slightly lower interest rate could save thousands of dollars over the life of a home loan.
I'll get lost.
I'll do everything I can.
It almost worked.
I contacted my parents.
The peace talks ended in failure.
No one saw me.
I like fishing.
That's expensive.
He locked up his jewels in the safe.
It brings me great joy.
There are a lot of abandoned houses in the neighborhood.
I feel awful about what I said.
They fell into each other's arms.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I have nothing to say against it.
I met Mary yesterday.
They didn't choose me.
My home is far away.
I may die tomorrow.
No one listens to me when I talk.
I work nights.
You were a kid once, right?
Are you playing with my feet?
It's you who've acted inappropriately.
They look cool.
Get on your knees.
He got dressed and went outside.
You should be used to this by now.
I belong to the karate club.
I think this isn't correct.
I accepted her invitation.
Tom called a cab for me.
What else can go wrong?
Do you have any sisters?
I can't remember.
Let's hope there are no more acts of vandalism.
I hope you have a wonderful evening.
Tom is three inches taller than Mary.
He pretended not to hear me.
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
Are you lost?
He got me some vegetables.
I have feeling in my legs.
It was unlocked.
That's her.
I had no idea things were so bad.
I don't feel very confident.
You had better not tell your father about the accident.
It looks like you did a pretty good job.
This is our last day here.
He tried it again, but in vain.
It's bad weather, to be sure, but we've seen worse.
We're waiting for you to leave.
Please explain the rule to me.
Tom had a panic attack.
They're handcuffed.
All they had was each other.
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
Had you been drinking?
I guess the dog bites.
You're still alive.
You're really in bad shape.
Tom has signed a three-year contract.
Germany made an alliance with Italy.
This book is small.
I wasn't sure where I belonged.
Are you bored?
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
I don't need you or anybody else.
I want you to listen to this song.
You should ask Mary out.
I can't breathe through my nose.
Don't let go. Hold on tight.
It's a bunch of nonsense.
Tom would like to speak to you.
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
Please excuse me for calling you so early in the morning.
I'll talk to you later.
She's a very wise mother.
She didn't feel like eating lunch.
I came here to meet you.
Compare your answer with Tom's.
She was blackmailed by him.
You're cruel.
I'm not convinced that you're telling the truth.
She cried all night.
The game has been postponed.
What kind of part-time job do you have?
Wait a little longer.
He was wrong.
We cleared the street of snow yesterday.
I tried to do everything you asked me to do.
Isn't that ours?
We all like him.
It was dark under the bridge.
I just got a call from the police.
I think what Tom is doing is amazing.
Look out of the window.
This isn't what I ordered.
Do you need the keys?
It just came out.
I'm still a member.
She had tears in her eyes.
Can you help me wash these dishes?
Are you mentally ill?
This climate is having a bad effect on your health.
I owe you nothing.
Sorry, but I have to hurry. I have no time to explain this in detail.
Garlic enhances the flavor of meals.
These containers are airtight.
You didn't have to wake me up.
I left it on the table.
Why don't you answer?
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'd say you're jealous.
The server was down.
The servant swept the floor.
Please keep this information to yourself.
He hit me in the face.
I just said I didn't want to talk about it.
Will you watch the Olympics?
They talked over the plan for hours.
I'd be happy if you'd come.
I have never been to Europe.
Summer is coming to an end.
I need another one.
I'm glad to hear of your success.
Tell me what really happened.
A flush is a poker hand where all five cards are of the same suit.
Come to me.
My dog is afraid of water.
Must I go on?
I'm happy to do this for you.
I promise I'll call.
You must pay in advance.
Are you ready for the next problem?
The man left the restaurant without paying.
I had my wallet stolen from my inner pocket.
The whole thing doesn't make sense.
A leap year has three hundred and sixty-six days.
Look at that big dog.
I found my shoes.
He's an absolute fool.
I don't expect you to start now.
He is one of my neighbors.
I'm nervous.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom doesn't know how to play the bass guitar.
I'm still not sure I can do that.
I have never fed my dog a banana.
Get down from your horse.
History is replete with the stories of unappreciated genius.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
You think of everything.
Everybody is supposed to know the law, but few people really do.
I can't believe he kissed you.
You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?
I really wish I could believe you.
Would you like to take a walk with me?
I think it'll be raining tomorrow.
Do you know where he lives?
I still have mine.
I wish I could live in a house like this.
Get serious.
I can't afford to do that.
Tom and Mary are planning a picnic at the lake.
Just call me when you're done.
Have you tried it before?
Smoking affects your health.
I can't believe I'm here.
They greeted each other warmly.
Please show me another one.
We must go to bed early tonight.
Why don't we settle the matter once and for all?
Is it serious?
I have a feeling you'll be a very good lawyer.
I could really get used to this.
You're too tense.
I tried to do all I could.
I like what you did.
It uses solar power.
I knew this was a waste of time.
It is evident that he has made a mistake.
I couldn't put up with her arrogant behavior.
I'm completely exhausted.
I thought that she was pregnant.
I was overweight.
I'm flabbergasted.
I have to do it by myself.
How many books do you have in your bag?
What's your full name?
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
I'm taking a vacation.
I no longer love him.
I immediately recognized them and so did Tom.
I'd like to see her.
I just want you to tell me why you lied.
It's almost seven. We have to go to school.
I'm not desperate.
Where's your captain?
You're very talented.
He asked for a beer.
Tom's house is very big.
I'd like to have your answer right away.
The police arrested everyone in the room.
Could you tell me what time it is?
When did you become a teacher?
What position do you hold?
It's not easy to thread a needle.
She told him that she was happy.
She isn't poor.
Tom bet Mary that he could beat her at arm wrestling.
Tom was the worst student in the class.
He's got what it takes to make it in the business world.
I've seen it all.
I can hardly understand what he says.
I took a shower and then went to bed.
I thought we'd try that new restaurant down the street.
They're looking for Tom.
Can you introduce me to a lawyer who speaks French?
We are his children.
This custom began in the Edo Period.
What are your intentions?
His garden is a work of art.
Tom is supposed to call around 2:30.
I thought she was 30 at most.
That's so inappropriate.
The concert was a great success.
I need a pencil. May I use one of yours?
Who are you supposed to be?
How does that strike you?
I never realized you were interested in Japanese art.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
Rinse with warm water.
Because of the dense fog, nothing could be seen.
Here's your change.
Are you sure you don't need my help?
Come on in.
I don't know how to say goodbye in French.
The problem with many things is the pre-conceived ideas we have about them!
I don't notice any difference.
I hate rainy days.
Tom is working hard to improve his French.
I'll be at the hospital.
That's what I think.
That's not quite what I wanted.
I am done teaching.
Do you know who painted this picture?
I want to help you get out of this mess.
Luck was on our side.
She found the evening boring and uninteresting, in short, a waste of time.
The only dessert I really like is ice cream.
We have no water.
Perhaps will he never become famous.
I was pleased.
I thought you'd got lost.
I was the one who suggested it.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
They have enough capital to build a second factory.
I don't mind if you smoke.
There is a man at the door.
Did you practice the piano this morning?
I want you to know that Tom's important to me.
Everything was happening so fast.
All right, give me a kiss.
How do I know if I'm wrong?
Have you decided?
His proposal is completely out of the question.
I know what they're doing.
My parents send you their best regards.
I wasted all morning waiting for you.
Have my piece of cake if you like.
I got upset.
We know all this.
He admitted his mistakes.
Did you read it all?
What do you think now?
What's going on out here?
Tom forgot the key in the lock.
Didn't you read the book?
The unemployment rate went up to 5%.
You must keep your promises.
There was nothing else to do.
When spring comes, they dig up the fields and plant seeds.
Who do you want to win?
You shouldn't take the things Tom says seriously.
It was shorter than he expected.
He was panting.
Close the blinds.
He wetted his towel with water.
I wasn't trying to hurt anybody.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
Tom treats me like a child.
She's smarter than me.
Will you sell your car to me?
What are you doing in my room?
Are you sure that's enough?
I wish it weren't true, but it is.
I'd like you to have a blood test.
Tom lives in a cave.
I went on reading.
Is Tom related to Mary?
You're off the hook.
You're lying, aren't you?
How deep is this well?
We'll all be there.
What's the cost?
We all worked really hard.
He is distracted.
Tom is a really good friend.
The moment she was alone she opened the letter.
I'm a lonely man.
You've never been happy.
Stay in bed.
This seems risky.
I mentioned your name to him.
They'll take care of you.
I can hear you loud and clear.
He knows better than to believe such a thing.
The part of an iceberg under the water is much larger than that above the water.
I appreciate you coming here.
Everywhere you look you can see young couples kissing.
My uncle has three children.
It's better to give than to receive.
Salmon lay their eggs in fresh water.
I like sleeping.
Who picked you for this job?
He cannot be trusted.
You've changed since I saw you last year.
Do you know what the population of Boston is?
They need the money.
Could you fill me in?
Tom and I are no longer living in Boston.
I love your son.
You look happy.
Japan has changed significantly in the past 50 years.
We're about ready.
She takes after her father.
Do you like Boston?
Give me a little money.
Come soon or there won't be any food left.
I don't know what else we can do.
Follow him.
At first, I didn't believe you.
She changed her hairstyle during summer vacation.
It takes time to heal from a divorce.
They're both beautiful.
Let's not waste this opportunity.
I belong to the music club.
The summer here is quite warm.
How long have you been a teacher?
Who talked?
I'm going to get married.
Are there oak trees on the hill?
What do you have to lose?
I'm as tall as my father.
God sent a sign.
To put it briefly, she turned down his proposal.
I didn't catch what you said.
That would be really interesting.
He died without having made a will.
When is the party?
Please come in.
Aren't you satisfied?
Cool down.
We didn't bring it with us.
You're useless.
It was fair.
Don't let me down.
You were jealous, weren't you?
Please paint the door white.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
That was a good trip.
You're not upset, are you?
I'll vote for you.
Cool it down.
He risked his life to save her.
Turn the page, please.
Cotton sucks up water.
How old is your uncle?
Tom decided to go home early.
It was love at first sight.
It is a very strange letter.
I dislocated my shoulder.
Tom will never give up.
They're all here.
This lid is too tight for me to open.
You are the only one who can help me.
The rabbit stood in the middle of the road, mesmerized by the lights of the oncoming truck.
I rescued him.
We need a plan.
Find Tom.
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
Would you join me in a drink?
It is absurd trying to persuade him.
Does Tom know why you're here?
In all probability, the cabinet will fall.
Do you own a gun?
This is a dog.
I feel ridiculous.
Where does it leave from?
Tom seems dangerous.
She needs to be more careful.
I'm the youngest child.
All things considered, I think you should go back home and take care of your parents.
I think we should go.
Although she is rich, she dresses quite simply.
I told you not to tell that to anyone.
What's your real purpose?
Just follow your heart.
Tom doesn't know you.
I felt excited.
Some things are perhaps not worth translating.
I am afraid I must be going now.
I presume that he has paid the money back.
You'd better take care of it soon.
Tell me which you want.
Drinks are on me.
I wasn't aware that you were feeling so bad.
That looks good on you.
Did you check this?
Do you know where I live?
I want vengeance.
Tom kept Mary waiting for a long time.
I don't know Boston that well.
Why did you paint the bench red?
I didn't know that she had a child.
Is this seat free?
You're very late.
The sisters hate each other.
It's very important to respect the rules.
I confiscated it.
Tom said that Mary might come back on Monday.
How many bags did you have?
I got over it. You should, too.
I feel safe here.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
You have my number. Call me sometime.
How did you hear about us?
This feels like silk.
She intended to become an actress.
Tom doesn't remember my name.
I remember when I first saw you.
This dog will protect us.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
Where did you get on this bus?
They formed a swim team.
You said you were happy.
I don't even like fish.
He ran to school, arriving in time.
Japan relies on Arab countries for oil.
One of my friends died last week.
I was a little surprised.
I'm fine.
I got the bicycle at a bargain.
I'm as curious as you are.
That's enough crying. Pull yourself together.
How about eating out this evening for a change?
A monument was erected in memory of the deceased.
I have a bicycle.
She can leave tomorrow.
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
Everything's going to work out.
So what's your problem?
No one came up here.
Who are you trying to impress?
Did I give you enough time?
Tom was busy all day yesterday.
I swim in the summer.
The child was told to apologize for being rude to the guests.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Aren't you embarrassed?
I can't believe you're giving up.
I'm at your mercy.
I don't feel like singing.
You don't have to apologize.
I am ready.
This store is in a prime location.
He demanded better pay.
In terms of salary, that job is fantastic.
She has ten children.
It's a big one.
They are about the same age.
A trip to America is out of the question.
I always end up looking up the same words in the dictionary.
Is that all you can say?
We have faith in Tom.
Tom thinks you should talk to Mary.
I wonder whether I could help Tom.
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
It sounds to me as if he has something to do with the matter.
I know what they're paying you.
Don't forget to call your mom.
The crowd got out of control and broke through the fence.
She often calls him names.
Police cordoned off the crime scene.
They're not bad.
I thought you told me you didn't know Tom.
Are you ready for bed?
Tom needs a prescription.
He struck a match, but quickly put it out.
They're coming.
Let's hope that's enough time.
Tell me about the incident.
You won't go, will you?
I'm feeling better.
Tom found his new job interesting.
Why are you going to Japan? "To attend a conference in Tokyo."
Tom filled out the application for me.
I think you should choose Tom.
He gets hives when he eats eggs.
You must be careful.
I don't particularly want to do that.
Not knowing what to answer, I kept silent.
I don't like it any more than you do.
He accused me of being a liar.
These pants fit me well.
Lincoln was a great statesman.
It is the job that is never started that takes longest to finish.
You worry about your weight too much.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
I love to hear a grandfather clock chime.
Do you play any instruments?
Repeat after me.
She fainted when she saw blood.
Will they elect him for four more years?
We know this song.
I had some work that needed finishing.
No one could find the answer.
He left his wife an enormous fortune.
Tom would've liked you. It's too bad that you never met each other.
We can't do this without some help.
I helped my father with the work.
He was accompanied by his girlfriend.
I live on a boat.
You've got to move.
Don't be disgusting.
Mary felt like Tom was undressing her with his eyes.
She is a good swimmer.
Can you handle it?
Tom is at school, isn't he?
I was drugged.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
Shake before using.
I lost ten kilos in three months.
The house belongs to him.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
I'm not a professional.
I've never heard him speak ill of others.
Hurry up, and you will be in time for the bus.
What do I mean to you?
This problem is hard to solve.
Tom has no intention of doing that.
How much is the rent per month?
I wasn't strong enough.
Tom rubbed his forehead.
Do you have any aspirin?
You are the chosen one.
To determine its origin, we must go back to the middle ages.
Cows supply us with milk.
I change my underwear every day.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
Tom realized the problem.
I didn't have much time.
I'd like to go to London.
This is a painting.
No one escaped.
I'll send it to you.
Lawyers are all liars.
Bring along your friend.
Good morning.
We can't call their bluff.
How do you know all these things?
Rabid dogs usually foam at the mouth.
How many songs did Tom and Mary sing together?
What are you going to do next?
He is getting better.
I'd like to go, too.
Where is the ticket window?
I felt left out.
I promise you I'll look after you.
You'd better hurry.
She made me a cake.
Tom tried to stand up, but he couldn't.
We have way too much work to do.
I'm still having the same dream about drowning.
Not knowing what to do, I asked for help.
I'm still angry because of her.
It was very hot.
I feel like I'm not wanted.
I'm not the one who should go.
This time, it's different.
I'm not trying to impress anyone.
Are you on your way home?
These machines aren't working now.
Let's do this properly.
You're such a tattletale.
You're wanted on the telephone.
Every day I either ride a bike or get the bus to work.
Look out!
There is no way of knowing where he's gone.
Excuse me, but may I open the window?
I was more than a little shocked by this.
How many siblings do you have?
You look nervous.
When was the last time you spoke with Tom?
Mary put her knitting aside and stood up.
I want to know who they are.
I suppose that's true.
Tom heard everything they said.
I know Tom is sensible.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
The tornado destroyed the whole village.
I'm a coward.
He wasn't there last week.
I like being with you.
The accident happened a year ago today.
What is he hiding?

You really are good.
Do you think I'm ugly?
You're a good kid.
I'm pleased with his performance.
He studied economics at college.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
I don't feel like playing.
Is there any other way besides extraction?
I've bought everything I was planning to buy.
The rice needs more salt.
We saw nothing strange.
They accused him of telling a lie.
Do you like this drawing?
I could use some help in the kitchen.
She always tries something new.
I paid the bill.
Health is an important factor of happiness.
Does that mean something to you?
I prefer fish to meat.
We've all done things we're ashamed of.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
Everything's going to be all right.
She is very proud of her daughter.
How can you be sure of that?
Why do you hate Tom so much?
Tell me how to do that.
Let me get back to you.
Do you want to leave it like that?
Tom suggested another plan to the committee.
This knife cuts well.
Why don't we call it a day?
It's about time to go to school.
All things considered, my father's life was a happy one.
Why did you come early?
Whenever I hear that song, I think of a certain girl.
I knew all about that.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
I don't like that at all.
You don't listen to me.
I don't know what you heard about me.
Shut the door.
I thought you were working.
You're my best friend, too.
It's the sort of day when you'd like to stay in bed.
The tines of the fork are bent.
Japanese houses are built of wood and they catch fire easily.
Day will break soon.
Have you ever cheated on an exam?
Why don't you take over?
Are you Tom?
That's my girlfriend you're talking to.
Do you really want to stay young forever?
Did you have fun?
When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere.
All the boys are the same age.
I heard a strange sound.
You've gone too far.
I think you'd better come back home.
My nose is itchy.
If it was easy, it wouldn't be a challenge.
Don't freak out.
I'll need to make some more tests.
We're not cops.
Tom says he might dye his goatee red and green for Christmas.
No sooner had he met his family than he burst into tears.
Why are we doing this?
The man left the restaurant without paying his bill.
Shouldn't we go now?
He blocked my way.
That's what the law says.
We miss you.
Don't talk to my sister like that.
It rained all through the afternoon.
We can't be the only two people who forgot to pay our bills on time.
Tom arrived on foot.
Everybody made it to the wedding.
Could you please have a look at this?
I have enough money to buy it.
We all make mistakes, right?
I hope you had a good time at the party.
It was a test.
We improved the quality.
Do you want me to handle this?
I don't know what motivated me to come here.
I used to watch this anime a lot when I was a kid, but I can't quite remember what happened to the hero in the final episode.
I thought I told you to trim your beard.
Tom and his friends sat around the campfire and roasted marshmallows.
I am brushing my teeth.
I will not be free tomorrow.
I like watching TV.
You know the law.
Do you know my name?
My dad is not home at the moment.
If you do this for me, I'll never ask you to do anything else.
Where are they?
It was her that told me.
The entire city was without electricity.
Tom is living in Boston.
You are the one.
Everything is broken.
Tom closed the blinds.
I'm scared too, so I'm not going to go.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
What do you love? What do you hate?
I really liked this article.
I learned to swim on my own.
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
A plastic dish will melt on the stove.
I'd like to see you again.
I don't want you to lose.
You don't have the right.
You won't have your way.
Why were you absent yesterday?
I never care about such things.
Don't open the door for anybody.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
I came to see you.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
This is legal.
Excuse me, but may I open the window?
I want to stay outside.
People are getting killed.
He's sketching an apple.
Tom is very gullible.
I'm working on a new song.
I'd like you to meet my brother, Tom.
I think it's time for me to leave now.
I'm no friend of yours.
Where is the bridge?
I don't know your name.
Tom and Mary don't agree with you.
Do you think it'll rain this afternoon?
I don't know why you didn't tell the truth.
I'll introduce you to the team.
Can you help me clean this up?
She was advised by him to work harder.
I called you.
How's your day going?
He must be a good boy.
His name was on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't remember it.
He will come back soon.
You're in better shape than I am.
The jury is deliberating.
He caught me by the arm.
Are we talking about the same Tom?
We wouldn't ask you to do that.
Someday you should give it a try.
Please don't forget to put stamps on the letters that I gave you to mail.
We're not needed.
My neighbor was arrested last night.
Tom doesn't have a daughter.
You have no fever.
Maybe he likes you.
I'm not miserable.
They were all surprised to see me there.
This is a very interesting question.
We have lots to do.
He breathed deeply before entering his boss's office.
We both do that.
I figured you'd be impressed.
Don't say another word.
I saw one.
I want you to drop it.
I'll be ready next time.
You're foolish.
I'm single.
How did I let this happen?
Tom hates dogs.
Hello, how's business?
In my city, there is no school for learning Esperanto.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I was just about to go out, when the bell rang.
Expensive meals can't compensate for lack of sleep.
I really wish you wouldn't do that.
What's the horse's name?
I saw you snickering.
You always said you wanted to become a scientist. Why didn't you?
You're the only one who can help me.
He called me a cab.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
He whispered sweet nothings into her ear.
That massage felt good.
I like to invent useful things.
He saw the accident on the way to school.
I spent all day in his house.
She is certainly above forty.
I want a round-trip ticket to Chicago.
He sat there surrounded by his children.
I do not read books.
You can't be in two places at once.
I ran in order to be on time.
He's not worthy of you.
Tell Tom I'll be there as soon as I can.
Tom imagined the worst.
I know Tom personally.
They did the right thing.
Do you know how much that car cost me?
I know only one way to do this.
It bothers me a lot.
My name's on the door.
I have two nephews.
I'm glad you invited me.
I had not seen a lion before I was ten years old.
They were tired of waiting.
Is that so bad?
He attained his goal.
Twelve is an even number.
Can I speak with you?
Thanks for the hint.
May I have something hot to drink?
They're going to arrest you.
Don't be alarmed.
You will find the job easy.
I found an apartment.
The lady that is speaking to that boy is his teacher.

This is a comfortable chair.
Why are you sitting there?

A good case can be made for the legalization of drugs.
I can now die a happy man.
I was very flattered.
I didn't get much sleep last night.
I began to be afraid you would never come back again.
That's not the way it happened at all.
I could tutor you.
That's why we want you.
She went in to get it.
The British forces were ordered to seize the weapons.
Do you really want to know?
Won't you have some cake?
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
I can't figure this out.

I think that we have to go now.
I think you know what I think.
Can you tell me how to fill in this form?
A comparable car would cost far more in Japan.
Tom remembered that Mary and John had tried to kill him.
It's not a gift.
Take heed of her advice.
We'll manage this.
I am an electrician.
You look fabulous.
My grandfather always sits in this chair.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
Am I making myself clear?
Do you have to go now?
Many boys and girls were present.
I want an hourly update about what's happening.
He thanked her for her kind help.
It is cheaper to go by bus.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Tomorrow, I have plans to go to Tokyo.
They couldn't find out why your car won't start.
You're more beautiful than I remember you.
I think there has been some misunderstanding here.
Tom isn't joking.
Do you like this music?
We have to tell them something.
Taste buds are needed to taste food.
Tom told me he was interested.
She has attractive eyes.
Don't try to pull a fast one on me!
I have problems concentrating.
You have a lot of books.
She interrupted him while he was speaking to my father.
I am busy.
Sorry Tom, I don't believe you.
I just have a lot on my mind.
Everybody lies.
It's not without risks.
This part of the library is closed to the public.
How did you learn to cook so well?
She could not get over her fear of the dark.
You aren't afraid of ghosts, are you?
I'm here to help you.
This meeting is boring.
It is wrong to steal.
I feel uneasy in my father's presence.
Can I bum a cigarette off you?
I don't mind leaving at six o'clock.
It's completely dark.
Do you use all this stuff?
He's always complaining about something.
I am sure that you will be satisfied.
He is playing outdoors.
My jeans shrank.
Be kind to old people.

Hay is for horses.
I lost my ticket. What should I do?
I had some time to think.
Why did it take so long?
Tom has lived in Boston for three years.
Work is everything to me.
I am glad that you have succeeded.
Tom put the screws in a small plastic bag.
The problem is that you're not Canadians.
It was a dry year, and many animals starved.
That's not where I was last night.
I'm glad you could join us.
Birds fly long distances.

I had a wonderful time.
Who is your favorite author?
I think Tom is in love with you.
You should always wear a seat belt when you are riding in a car.
Is this natural?

Nobody's going to rescue you.
It's not an easy sport.
I don't want us to be enemies.
He'll be groggy for another few hours until the drug wears off.
English is pretty hard, isn't it?
Tom must've been surprised.
Tom sat down on the sofa.
I'm living in a town.
Let me tell you how I really feel.
I know you've been trying to help.
Tom is proud of you.
Is this a bad time to chat?
You said that you were here yesterday.
I suggest that you go by train.
How is your last name written?
Let's stay focused.
How about going for a walk after lunch?
We suspected him of lying.
I know how hard it's been.
I don't have any children yet.
He's already married.
You had better take her advice.
She filled the vase with water.
I don't think I can help you.
Get in the car now.
That's not how.
Stay out of my way.
He is beyond hope.
You aren't invited.
We can all dream.

Do you really want to talk about that now?

Will you shut up?
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
This shirt costs ten dollars.
He went over to the other side.
I like your painting.
Shut the door tight.
I'm desperate.
You can't fix it. You should buy a new one.
A few months later they return to their breeding grounds in the Arctic.
I wish you'd told me that a bit earlier.
I know Tom is troubled.
Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?
Did Tom ask you to do it?

If Tom were here, he'd know what to do.
I believe that he's happy.
This is Chinese food.
I'm taking it seriously.
They don't really care.
That's all I needed to hear.

Should we start?
My hobby is collecting stamps.
Tom has gone to Australia.
If that's what you want to do, do it.
It's my dream to have a son who'll take over my business when I retire.

Now is the time.
You don't have to take your umbrella with you.
Is he all right?
Please stay where you are.
You should inform your mother as soon as you can.
Please read that book.
She's just putting up a front.
What happened here?
He doesn't want you to know.
Words failed me.
Are you waiting for something?
My roommate complained about the noise.
Our plans are taking shape.
Try to jump as high as possible.

I think it's cruel to keep a cat indoors.
You've put your hat on backwards.

He will never make it.
Tom is too young to go to school.
Did you get your wish?
I wish I had eaten breakfast.
I thought I'd surprise you.
I'm just getting back to basics.
I don't even know where to look.
How much farther is it?
He grew old.
Unfortunately, I don't have time today.
I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.
Don't you think I would like to do that?
He killed himself by taking poison.
Rinse with warm water.
There is nothing more refreshing than a cold beer on a hot day.
He was absent because of illness.
He sold his own car without hesitation.
Believe that if you want to.
We can't go.

Maybe I shouldn't have kissed you.
Did you know that your oven doesn't work?
How did you know we were here?
Tom advised Mary not to believe everything she reads on the Web.
The house is on the hill.
She will give you what money she has.
We need to focus on our strengths.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
We must control our passions.
It's supposed to be the other way around.
I can't stand this kind of music.
I'm sorry for what I have done.
Tom is awesome.

Everyone is tired.
I wish she were alive now.
You nearly died.
I think we should run.

Do you like the way you look?
How could anyone be so stupid?
Don't push it.
I gave Tom that.
How many players are there?
How many hours a day does Tom swim?
Where do you want to eat?
This can't be the way to do it.
What did you think I meant?
Why would you want to be a teacher?
You look strong.
When should I return the car?

She didn't want to sell the book.
What am I supposed to do if Tom comes?
I don't know who that is.
No one here knows anything.
I'm afraid to go.
Children like gummy bears.
No practical joker should be without a whoopee cushion.
Most people think I'm crazy.
We are doing business with many countries.
This noise is unbearable.
Tom put his money in a shoe box.
Tom dozed off in French class.
Hold on a minute.
You shouldn't let children play with the kitchen knife.
The enemy attack ended at dawn.
We should follow Tom.
Neither of us can speak French.
You've gone too far.
I'm meeting Tom for lunch at a restaurant on Park Street.
No one I know goes there anymore.
It is not impossible.
I'm extremely happy.
They all did it.
That's a good move.
I had some fun.
I never imagined so many people would come to my party.
I'm giving up smoking.
Ask at the police box over there.
She shook her head.
Cabbage can be eaten raw.
Where were you when I needed you?
She's not yet heard the news.
I'll give him a buzz.
I will always remember you.
I was just talking to your mother.
Tom thinks he can succeed where others have failed.
Take whichever one you like.
May I do it right now?
I don't know anything about her.
The doctors are looking at an x-ray.
This is just the type of car I want.
My name is Tom and I'll be your server tonight.
He has the bad habit of chewing his pencil.
We value our customers.
The holidays are coming.
We're saving lives.
Why not both?
The stars seem dim because of the city lights.
There's no hiding the fact from her.
May I use your dictionary?
I am a runner.
Mary took her necklace off.
He attended the party yesterday.
I thought you would understand.
I thought I'd always be alone.
Let's decorate the Christmas tree.
This movement from rural to urban areas has been going on for over two hundred years.
I don't like sweet drinks.
Do you know where they are?
She advised him to leave earlier.
You must study more.
Night is when most people go to bed.
I don't believe this is happening.
One is never too old to learn.
Those are very famous people.
You're very busy.
You don't have enough experience.
I like the color blue.
I'm a teacher, not a student.
All things must pass.
What is his business?
She became scared when she noticed the man following her.
I'm not really in the mood.
Have they spotted you?
Please come here.
Think about your future.
What's the world's highest mountain?
Thanks for coming all this way.
I love Italian food.
We depend on foreign nations for our natural resources.
There are many red flowers in the garden.
To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
This isn't the right way.
Tom is the best roommate I've ever had.
I'll lend you some books of my brother's.
In accepting the money, he lost the respect of the people.
I saw him cross the road.
He is not himself today.
Since I was sick, I didn't go to school.
Thank you very much for attending.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
Do you want something?
We'll miss living in Boston.
Did I miss something?
I'm sorry about your loss.
We're certain.
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
That's why Tom and I were disappointed.
Are you coming to my party?
I just started to learn Esperanto.
The quickest means of travel is by plane.
You're a disgrace.
He checked the calculations again just to make sure.
I don't know whether he will come or not.
Ain't that cute?
I found no money left in my pocket.
Let's hit the road.
Your English is improving.
This is too easy, I guess.
Tom was stripped to the waist.
The worst is already over.
I don't know if I can make it without you.
Come in.
I went home.
Tom almost always falls asleep at night hugging his teddy bear.
Thanks for stopping by.
Is that why you called?
There's a song I want to sing for you.
He cares a lot about his reputation.
You're careful.
I can't believe you said that.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
I usually get what I want.
Tom drank three bottles of wine by himself last night.
She does not like him.
Tom didn't know where Mary had put her suitcases.
He turned his attention to the picture.
No one told me.
She divorced him last year.
Nobody listened to me.
I assume that's a joke.
Don't bother.
Do you have any more of those?
Don't spread yourself too thin.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
Where did you find my umbrella?
She is two years older than you.
I knew Tom was lying to me.
I'll decide.
Doing that will be easy.
I thought Tom was unemployed.
Tie your shoe.
You need to relax.
Do you have a better idea?
I promised.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
A horse passed my house.
Everyone thinks we're a couple.
What do you think is down there?
I turned off the light.
We should take a break and have some tea.
Ask her how much soup she wants.
He drank the whisky as if it were water.
Why would I want to sue you?
I really don't get you.
Please help yourself to the cake.
I love hard-boiled eggs.
Cover it up.
Look at my arm.
Let's synchronize our watches.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
May I borrow your dictionary?
You're either with me or you're against me.
I couldn't do that.
You are my friend.
What do you mean?
Tom learned to ski on his own.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
I'll get rid of them.
It's dangerous to talk on the phone and drive at the same time.
No one can hear us.
Members of that tribe settled along the river.
I thought for a minute we had a problem.
I figured I might find you here.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
This rope is strong, isn't it?
What's all this?
Here are your keys.
What are you trying to hide? "Nothing."
Is this all you can give me?
She has never danced with him.
These cars are ours.
Enjoy your food.
I have a few friends who speak French well.
I'll get something to drink for both of you.
As soon as she heard the news, she burst into tears.
I will be back soon.
Happiness isn't merely having many possessions.
Hand me that magazine.
I need a little more space.
And then, what did you do?
The policeman aimed his gun at the man.
I'm going to play soccer after school.
What do you think happened to Tom?
I can't be seen with you.
I didn't want any of that.
He's not here yet.
I couldn't find his house.
What did the boy say?
I don't know what this symbol stands for.
She spoke scarcely a word of English.
Will you help them?
I missed you.
You don't seem convinced.
The explorers finally reached their goal.
In this town, there is only one train station.
He speaks English fluently.
She gave him everything she owned.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mary wore a pale blue dress.
You look kind of down.
I can hardly hear him.
This is the real world.
We're pulling back.
Is it you?
Who was there that night?
You didn't have to lie.
I have responsibilities.
Is this man threatening you?
Have you been told the reasons why we didn't hire you?
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
You're kind of cute.
Quick, give me that.
You won't believe your eyes.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
You can't go yet.
He felt himself being lifted up.
The computer is to her left.
You don't seem very pleased.
Here he comes.
Have you ever broken a bone?
Tom smells awful.
I like women.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
I seldom go out.
Why don't you tell me what to do?
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
She changed her schedule to match his.
Neither of my brothers will be there.
Could I have a word with you in private?
Room service, please.
She was brushing her hair in front of a mirror.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
We think the world of you.
I just knew you would say that.
I want to punch you in your face.
I hope things will get better.
Smoke appeared.
It was all so easy.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
When were you born?
You're very rude.
I'd like to do something different.
We were all happy.
He's out now.
This room is for VIPs.
How long is the flight?
I've never seen you laugh.
What exactly do you want us to do?
I kind of expected you to come alone.
Tom is about to fall asleep.
I studied French for three hours last night.
I will have to help them.
It's raining cats and dogs.
He seems to have told a lie.
Be as specific as possible.
I'm not exactly surprised.
That hardly seems fair.
Is that a fact?
She doesn't have any brothers.
She doesn't like sushi.
Why are you so busy today?
Is this everything?
We treated him in the politest manner possible.
It's just like a nightmare.
Every time he goes out, he drops in at the bookstore.
I can hardly hear you.
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
They didn't find the bomb.
We know that you're sick.
I loved that house.
Can eating just vegetables help you lose weight?
We keep having the same old problem of people not paying their bills on time.
They gave up.
You look Japanese.
I applied for a visa.
How many pairs of shoes do you own?
How is that different?
Your mother and father are dead.
I'll win using whatever means it takes.
We used a barrel for a makeshift table.
Should I wait for you here?
A good lie is easier to believe than the truth.
Be nicer to your brother.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
She shook hands with him.
We carried out that plan.
He's very understanding.
She is quite a clever girl.
We're not all as tired as you are.
She looks very afraid.
The machine operates around the clock.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Isn’t love supposed to last forever?
I'm not normal.
I want to stay here a couple more days.
Tom took off his belt.
He is not very good at mathematics.
Let's have a look.
I don't like the way she speaks.
I know you're just trying to help, and I appreciate that.
We had a lot of snow last winter.
There's a lot work to do today.
It's locked.
I don't like doing that.
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
Tom is drunk as a skunk.
I haven't seen Tom for months.
He is dead drunk.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
What is your earliest memory from childhood?
He's always at home on Mondays.
Who's my teacher?
Why were you in prison?
I hid behind the tree.
I bought a VIP pass.
I complain a lot.
I'm not rich.
I didn't get the job.
Don't you want to help?
Get back into your car.
Boil some water.
Wine is made from grapes.
Most Japanese eat rice at least once a day.
I need to be prepared.
I am feeling sad about it.
How can you be so selfish?
I don't feel like it.
I think that he has mumps.
They gave us their word.
That would be interesting.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
He doesn't seem to be heading for the town.
We'll try this later.
We have a signed agreement.
It was late, so I went home.
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
I'd never let that happen.
Don't go without a hat.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
He is lying on the sofa.
Who wrote this letter?
If you don't want me to go, I won't.
I didn't need to paint the fence.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
She is bad at sports.
I was extremely angry.
Many fish died.
We can both do it.
I haven't got the foggiest notion what you're talking about.
This is a superb idea.
I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket.
Tom didn't take a shower.
I walk to school.
I have a guilty conscience.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
We're out of luck again.
I heard voices.
I'm not in the mood to go downtown.
Since you're tired, you should rest.
I'm a geologist.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
Our yacht club has ten members.
Tom began to dance.
She doesn't like soccer.
I'm so tired I can hardly walk.
Thank you very much for all you have done.
I'm not a patient person.
It is likely to be fine tomorrow.
Your driver's license has expired.
By the way, how old are you?
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
They'll kill you.
You probably won't be able to do that.
Roger Miller was born on January 2, 1936 in the western city of Fort Worth, Texas.
I'm kind of full.
You're very brave.
Is the cat all right?
Would you mind if I swam in your pool?
It's no use waiting for him to come.
I have to look for my pen.
She's a model.
I skipped French class today.
She is gaining weight.
That's what the boss wants.
I thought you wanted the truth.
You don't sound so sure.
It would take at least three hours to do that.
I lost track of all time during our walk in the woods.
It was a dark night.
The public was notified on October 20th.
Nothing's working.
I am going to see the dentist tomorrow.
I thought you'd left.
How much does it cost?
If I were you, I would stay quiet.
I told everyone to be careful.
He didn't give me much advice.
I work out to stay in shape.
That job paid well.
Your wristwatch is on the table.
We've seen three wars.
As soon as I can get the chance, I'll come for a visit.
Where can I rent a car?
We can't do it.
I can't do this job without you.
Are your parents home?
Tom and Mary got into an argument.
He caught them stealing apples.
Take care of yourself. Don't get sick.
I love you more than anyone else.
I have an older brother and an older sister.
At last, he realized his mistakes.
Those are all fine options.
Tom really sounds upset.
He is a brave and cheerful boy.
She had a real talent for smoothing over troubled situations.
One of us could help you.
Please correct the errors.
I'm real careful.
He disliked school.
To have doubts about oneself is the first sign of intelligence.
I'm not going to waste my money.
Where's your other brother?
She was struck by lightning.
I was asked to umpire the game.
Could you fill me in?
Someone's trying to kill me.
I hate being alone at Christmas.
You've got to take care of yourself.
You don't have to answer.
I don't know you.
Let's go downtown.
I go grocery shopping every morning.
His girlfriend did it for him.
I don't find it intimidating.
We can't do this by Friday.
It's no trouble at all.
I never saw you.
The mayor thought that he should investigate the decline in tax revenues.
He came out on top.
If you do not have this book, you can buy it.
I don't consider that expensive.
Tom is the only one who doesn't know.
Tom calls Mary every night.
They left there the day before yesterday.
It was really incredible.
How do you account for that?
Don't tell anyone.
I don't feel like studying today. Let's go to a soccer game.
Tom's horse bit him.
Tom and Mary realized that they weren't really compatible.
He became wiser as he grew older.
I was discharged without notice.
Tom waited for more than an hour.
I am okay.
If I'd only taken the time to read the instruction manual!
I knew they were coming.
He's a rather rare individual.
I kept the seat warm for you.
Tom was trying to be funny.
Tom will be surprised to see you.
Tom didn't scream.
I haven't seen any of his films.
I promise I'll mop the floor tomorrow morning.
What an interesting book this is!
I've read your book. It was very interesting.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
Please step aside.
I'm a farmer.
Every privilege carries responsibility with it.
That never happened, of course.
Why don't you run along?
We went to the river.
Even the greatest scholar can't solve that.
How tall you are!
What do your children usually eat for breakfast?
The situation worsened.
I met her an hour ago.
I wash my car once a week.
He gets on my nerves.
Don't touch my stuff.
You're very upset.
You must have made a mistake.
My daughter's your age.
That didn't even occur to me.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
I'm ashamed to say that it's true.
It looks like you've regained your confidence.
They are bored.
Why do you want to go out with me?
I don't have anything to declare.
Apparently, not much has changed.
You're not looking at the big picture.
Are you a ghost?
She is the executive editor.
Tom made a serious error.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
We have finished lunch.
Did you lose your car keys?
She makes excellent meals in the blink of an eye.
Drink a lot of water.
I sleep standing up.
Prices are rising.
I saw him crossing the road.
It was a shock to hear about Tom's divorce.
May I ask a question?
Turn in your homework.
Don't call me anymore.
Use them all.
Do you speak English?
She is in her hotel now.
During the war, factories ran around the clock.
I don't understand why it happened.
You may as well get used to it.
Never give up on your dreams.
I woke up at five this morning.
We need to take care of this immediately.
What is your number?
I can't reach that can of tomatoes.
Where are your suitcases?
I saw some people swimming in the river.
There are no rules.
I wish I were rich.
Our parents took care of us and now it's our turn to take care of them.
Get out of my life!
Life is not all fun and games.
Do your very best.
Thanks for coming over tonight.
Just a moment, please.
After a while, corn flakes in milk will become soggy.
Apart from his parents, no one knows him well.
I prefer to eat alone.
I guess Tom is right.
Do you like to be alone?
What do you think of these shoes?
I'm overworked.
My camera is much better than yours.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
She left here right away.
They decided to put an end to the discussion.
Tom is out of town on business.
Keep your shirt on.
I want to keep doing this for as long as possible.
I make you nervous, don't I?
You're very good at this.
That's not always the case.
I haven't done this for years.
I was there.
She said, "I owe it to him that I am popular."
I borrowed money not only from Tom, but from his wife, too.
Here is your key.
I'd love to be able to spend less time doing household chores.
There's a table.
We don't have time to do that right now.
It's so imprecise.
Do you want some breakfast?
He turned Christian.
It doesn't take very long.
Will you dance with me?
To be happy, you should spend time with someone you love.
Do you feel like going out for a walk?
My number was called last.
I've removed the comma.
I am very glad to see you.
She has good control over her class.
I really should know the answer.
She acted as a guide.
I want to move away.
He was panting.
He was covered all over with paint.
It'll cost around ten thousand yen.
I'm homeschooled.
I helped my mother clean the kitchen.
I'll give you a piece of advice.
Are you questioning my judgment?
Few people live to be ninety years old.
You must control yourself.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
Please don't smoke cigarettes no matter what.
Don't make so much noise.
Can you make the deadline?
Tom claims he won.
Tom lacks confidence in himself.
I've forgotten Tom's last name.
Where did you find it, at school or at home?
The more you study, the more you discover your ignorance.
Drunken driving is a serious problem.
My life has changed quite a lot.
Nobody answered the door.
They aren't the kind of people you should want to be friends with.
Tom is doing great now.
Do you mind if I take my shirt off?
It was impossible to pull out the cork.
I'm still not ready yet.
He's a hunk.
Don't make me beg.
He seems to be very sleepy.
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
I haven't been sleeping very much lately.
Would you like to give it a try?
I'll stay if it rains.
This isn't music.
You're the man I've been looking for.
I know you feel lonely.
Is there anything you want to know?
Tom said that Mary was beautiful.
Here we go.
Which do you like better, white wine or red wine?
It wasn't much of a view.
Can you read that?
This kind of thing usually takes a long time.
Everything went according to plan.
Gasoline costs more in France than in the United States.
They don't despise you.
You were the one who gave this to me.
I am in a spot.
A bird has wings.
He showed me his photograph album.
He once knew her, but they are no longer friends.
My parents persuaded me not to travel alone.
You can make your own.
You never know when this might come in handy.
Such a plan is bound to fail.
This is a real surprise.
It's nearly three o'clock.
I don't think you ought to.
No one looks busy.
You all know what you have to do.
We are a family.
I found the picture you were looking for.
I knew this wouldn't work.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
It is very cold today, isn't it?
I don't know why I bother coming here.
It's not the first time.
This is no joke.
She called him every other day.
I cut myself.
I warned him not to be late.
He looks well.
He lives in the suburbs of London.
I confiscated it.
Tom died trying to save a child from a burning building.
You can't swim here.
You don't have to be so rude.
Let me go.
Don't call me a moron.
He will never make it.
I think we need a new strategy.
Are you students at this school?
I know where they will be this afternoon.
She was naive.
Do you have a son?
Who is the man that you were talking with?
Tom can't see without his glasses.
I have thirteen cats.
Tom was unfriendly to Mary.
We've been through a lot together.
Look, I'm a little busy.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
She adores him.
A lot of tourists invaded the island.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
I can't ask Tom to do that.
I think it's time for me to move to the suburbs.
Wait for us.
What's the weather like where you are?
What drives you?
He just doesn't measure up.
I'll visit you at your office tomorrow.
Tom lost his only son in a car accident.
Behave like a man.
That's an ugly tie.
This is strictly forbidden.
They did not feel like playing any more.
How much money do I owe you?
She advised him not to buy a used car.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
What do they look like?
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
Could you please repeat that?
You don't seem too happy to see me.
He is accustomed to hard work.
Why did you agree to spend the evening with Tom?
My uncle gave me a pair of shoes.
A woman visited us while you were sleeping.
Tom says he's planning to buy Mary a gift.
It sounded like a dream job.
What are you interested in?
I just got a promotion.
I walked three-fourths of a mile.
I feel cold. Do you mind closing the window?
He swims in the river.
France was at war with Russia.
The idea is not bad.
I just hope it's not too late.
Get that thing off of me.
Today is not your lucky day.
Are you a student here?
Oh, don't be so modest.
There is something wrong with my car.
I have something you want.
Have you ever had lunch at this restaurant?
It's rarely nice weather at Easter.
It was a fine day so I went on a picnic.
Tom is in the living room.
Tom lives in a tiny house.
You're spending too much time watching TV.
Which one will they choose?
Tom is weak.
I have one brother and two sisters.
They stood on the hilltop.
You look as healthy as ever.
I owe my success to him.
Did I hurt you?
I don't know how to contact you.
He is the father of three children.
My car battery is dead.
It should be like this.
Tom was given a warm reception.
If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.
Four is an unlucky number in Japanese.
I think we all should have been more careful.
I'll go by plane.
We are going to travel by car.
Those standing were all men.
No one is going to harm you.
See what happens when you give people advice?
This is the last train.
Blood is thicker than water.
There is so much to do, and only a lifetime to do it.
Let's meet at the station at 2:30.
It's unlocked.
I lived in this house as a child.
We're out of beer.
I want a lawyer.
If you want to succeed in life, work hard.
You can't park on this street.
You probably already know about our company.
Don't be shy.
He's a senior.
Where are my hiking boots?
Do your homework by yourself.
Above all, children need love.
I'm busy.
You only live once.
No news is good news.
What is a UFO?
I'm eating here.
I'll walk.
Are you sure you want to put your life in her hands?
We came by to wish you luck.
I will be seventeen next week.
My grandfather is in his nineties.
What a coincidence!
Motorcycles are very cheap.
I have something to tell you.
You're off the hook this time.
The sheet is on the bed.
I can't help you do that.
Cross the street.
She's on a roll.
Come on.
It must've been extremely painful.
They handled it well.
She didn't want him to go out with other women.
Write carefully and legibly.
Where did you get this key?
Tom was like a brother to me.
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
You're fascinating.
You've really earned this.
Quito, Ecuador, is a little south of the equator.
They went into the woods for a picnic.
Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
He mistook me for my younger brother.
Smoking is really bad for your health.
Since I was sleepy, I went to sleep.
Tom told me he'd already eaten.
I wonder why they left my name off the list.
You're one of my best friends.
I've got to take my library books back before January 25th.
Have you finished dressing?
I'll make you some coffee.
How do you stop this?
I find that very interesting.
Yours is over there.
Does the price include breakfast?
It is said that he was very rich.
This is the reason why I didn't come yesterday.
He has wine.
She is contemplating a trip.
As far as I know, the novel is not translated into Japanese.
He said that America declared its independence in 1776.
I hope your family is well.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
I prefer that it stay that way.
This is my brother's.
I'm just telling you the truth.
If I had my way, you would all be fired.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Whereabouts did you say this happened?
It's fun to travel.
Please write down what I say.
I was stupid enough to believe Tom.
You're an interesting girl.
That's not how it is.
Do you work on Mondays?
I think they want you to do it.
He's spending too much time watching TV.
You always say that.
My mother knows how to make cakes.
It takes 165 years for Neptune to orbit around the sun.
How do you think it made me feel?
I thought it was cool.
I didn't see you come in.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.
That's the difference.
I need a pencil.
I was just fooling around.
I know this must be hard for you.
She made him a new coat.
How is your family name written?
How I've missed you!
I want a knife to cut the rope with.
I liked your friends.
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
You didn't have any choice.
Tom's suffocating.
She filled her bag with apples.
Air is to us what water is to fish.
I'm sorry, I don't buy it.
There is nothing more important than friends.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
Is there someone else?
I'll call you after lunch.
These problems will be solved in the near future.
They accused me of being a liar.
Do you think this is real?
Stop me if you can.
We'll respond.
They told me I had to help you.
Do you actually live here?
Tom was lying on the couch.
Tom just showed up at work.
I know that you still love me.
Where can you get the best fresh bread?
How did you meet him?
It was fabulous.
The feeling is mutual.
Not all criminals need to be incarcerated.
I'm starved.
I got the ax.
I had a lot of fun doing that.
Stop treating me like a child.
I'm going to park the car.
They dragged their boat onto the beach.
Are you sure there's nothing else to drink?
That school looks just like a prison.
Who forced you to do that?
If I remember correctly, that's the song Tom sang at Mary's wedding.
This book costs 3,000 yen.
The evidence convinced us of his innocence.
I plead ignorance.
What's Tom doing with my car?
Is it a military secret or something?
I think the prices in this store are way too high.
You are mistaken about that.
Is this the right thing to do?
I'd like you to look at something.
I'm prepared.
I'll find out soon enough.
You have to read between the lines to know the true intention of the author.
He doesn't seem to be aware of the problems.
What is your favorite holiday?
I see you are awake.
Will you ever tell me your age?
I can't believe I'm really here.
Will you go to the dance with me?
He achieved his goal.
We need to get going.
Some things are impossible.
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
Can I use your car for a little while?
The nurses are very nice.
I yelled at Tom.
Are you ready for bed?
Judging from the look of the sky, it may rain this afternoon.
Tom said he's sympathetic.
He waited until she came.
Are you enjoying it?
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
Why did you eat that?
What is still better is that the house has a beautiful garden.
Don't forget your stuff.
You're very brave.
The assassin smothered his victim with a pillow.
His childhood was harsh.
I'd like to get off at the next stop.
A man was complaining of something in a sharp voice.
I mean no disrespect.
We don't have the same values.
He is in the kitchen.
I'll go with you.
I remember mentioning it once or twice.
The rooms are deserted.
The only way is up.
Are we going to lose?
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
Did you read it all?
He came from another country.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
How dare you speak to me in that tone!
I am relieved that you are safe.
What do you think they'll do to me?
Tom is strong, isn't he?
I was present at school yesterday.
It's not us who did it.
Can we really learn to speak a foreign language like a native?
My throat's a little dry.
At last, we got to the lake.
There are wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot perceive.
A lot has happened.
I feel very comfortable with you.
I've come to ask you a question.
You probably don't want to talk to me.
We love what we do.
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
I have a lot of money in my savings account.
Do you think the shooting was accidental?
I know myself.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
Tom has a good heart.
We should do everything ourselves.
You must go to school.
Are we just friends?
I refuse to accept that.
My friend likes to live in the city, but his wife prefers to live in their little cottage in the country.
There is only one store on the whole island.
When did the meeting start?
I didn't know whether I wanted to go to university.
I'll need to check my schedule.
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
The man held on to his job stubbornly and would not retire.
Do you want to watch a movie?
She understands music.
What would you have me do?
There were fifty entries for the race.
It's time for you to tell me the whole truth.
Why are you doing this?
Do not turn off your computer.
What is it you want to talk about?
We're all single.
I met Tom the other day.
What would you like to be called?
Why don't you give me a break?
We must finish everything before Tuesday morning.
The noise will wake the baby up.
He always sings in the shower.
Do you still want me to give Tom your old computer?
Is that a wolf?
I'm not sure if it's a compliment or an insult.
Tom won't let anyone touch it.
No one speaks this language anymore.
I know that won't happen again.
Leave us alone.
Make sure the door is locked.
She read the article over and over again.
We must fix this.
Can you help me with the washing up?
I'm your friend.
I want to play, too.
You've both been very impressive today. I'm proud of you.
What do you think happens then?
We'll sort this out tomorrow.
Don't ask me about the speech.
My uncle has a good knowledge of French.
Let's not tell anybody.
Tom had a five o'clock shadow.
I'll never see you again.
In my job I have to deal with all kinds of people.
Are you sure you're not tired?
What do you think this is?
In the United States, school buses are yellow.
I'm getting tired of losing.
You can study here.
He spoke highly of you.
You're not old enough to drive.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
There are no oranges on the table.
She is his present wife.
This is a hundred dollar bill.
He hasn't read the book yet.
Tom couldn't persuade Mary to stay.
I don't remember that happening.
She is devoted to her husband.
Tom finished writing the report in less than three hours.
He's a control freak.
He worked from morning till night.
The tire on my bicycle is flat.
People lived in villages.
Does truth matter?
They kept drinking.
The work was very difficult.
I'm not giving up.
Sometimes I go, sometimes I don't.
Rules are meant to be kept, not broken.
Can you excuse me a moment?
You're very forward.
I'll beat you up!
Have you written your report?
You can open your eyes now.
They made fun of my clothes.
Tom passed out.
You don't know how bad I want to leave.
Where does he work now?
I hear some screaming.
What're you doing?
I'm the only one who can do that.
Tom went abroad to study French.
We were always together.
I'm going to go call the police.
Did you get his letter?
What's worrying you?
I don't have to listen to that.
Their intimacy grew with the years.
Where are my slippers?
This story has an unhappy ending.
Don't try to be a hero now.
Tom seemed disappointed.
I left you a message at the front desk.
The buses run every ten minutes.
The meat's not ready yet.
Tom just died.
Father's hair has turned gray.
I'll be happy to answer your question.
They broke off their engagement.
Why are you so arrogant?
I think Tom won't come to our party.
I don't see how that's relevant.
He earns his living by writing.
They loved Tom.
What are you frightened of?
I suggest you leave.
Who is your brother?
Didn't they teach you anything at Harvard?
He acted as our guide.
My mother hasn't slept in 3 days due to her illness.
Don't touch the stove.
I refused to believe it.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Tom is an old man.
What was wrong with the old one?
We're going to have so much fun.
These ice cubes will melt soon.
We all got scared.
Don't run.
Tom has dark skin.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
How long have you been planning this wedding?
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I've got to do this.
This one is the worst.
Take away this box.
You are a good cook, aren't you?
I believe in him.
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
I agree with him.
She was the last woman I expected to see.
I wanted to run away with Tom.
I'm sick of hearing the same thing all the time.
That's my favorite excuse.
It's garbage.
I found the book easily though it was dark in the room.
He fell in love with his best friend.
Have I missed anything?
I'm getting sleepy.
The boy who had been missing was identified by his clothes.
I'll never be as good as you.
It seems obvious that he is sick.
The banana was brown and mushy.
I figured I might find you here.
I'm not a psychic.
I don't know what's in this box.
I learned it from you.
They agree.
You broke the rule.
I do this for a living.
I don't do that well.
It's rare to meet nice people like you.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
He looks like a horse.
She told him a joke, but he didn't think it was funny.
He was checking you out.
You're my only real friend.
He spoke with a softness characteristic of southerners.
You don't understand what's happening.
Don't you do this to me.
I'm not too convinced.
How could I refuse?
I went aboard.
He pushed his nose against the window.
I don't blame you for doing that.
She advised him on how to stay healthy.
Are you always that busy?
Allow me to go.
It is illegal to park a car there.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
I was thinking of buying a new car.
You won't be interested.
He must like taking walks.
Can you guess the price?
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
I beg of you to listen carefully.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
Statistics show that the population of the world is increasing.
You gotta get more organized.
He wants to go.
You speak French very well.
Somebody is watching me.
What happened? You look pale.
I haven't seen him for a long time.
I don't know where they are.
Tom will make a good teacher.
I've been studying French for three years.
The court's decision is final.
I gave you fair warning.
I went to your school.
How could Tom do such a thing?
Which one is more expensive?
Tell us where Tom is.
I wasn't in a hurry.
You don't need to do that.
Could you not do that here?
We can't reveal classified information.
Tom treated Mary like a queen.
My father reads the newspaper every morning.
What were you doing then?
He looks like a girl.
Let's go for a ride in my car.
There was no bathroom.
I know Tom is a father now.
A chance like this only comes along once in a blue moon.
Are there earthquakes in Germany?
Are you still playing golf?
I promise I'll take good care of your dog.
You need to look at the big picture here.
The river is deep here.
He made many excuses for being late.
I'm going to have to change my schedule.
Open your mouth.
I'm thinking about visiting my friend next year.
Do you own research.
I just got a little carried away.
How do you spell your family name?
I have plenty of theories.
I've given you everything I had.
I don't remember exactly.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had.
That bicycle over there is my brother's.
Tom doesn't seem very interested.
He knows a lot about animals.
He will make a good doctor.
Study hard.
It's very difficult to understand him.
The problem is worse.
I was happy yesterday.
I have to look after this cat.
Most of them just don't care.
Long time, no see.
You can easily find the bank.
I didn't make any promises.
She talked to the chairperson.
That's the eject button. Don't touch it.
Her mother became mad at us.
We have a bit of time now.
I know you're busy, but can I talk to you for a minute?
You were Tom's only friend.
Your answer is wrong.
I don't know anything about it.
I thought we could do better.
I have a friend in England.
I'm glad to make your acquaintance.
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
Any house is better than none.
A car has one steering wheel.
No one is working here today, except Tom.
Terrific!
Why are you acting like my mother?
She pulled the blinds down.
I want you to help me get out of here.
Whose pencil is this?
My tailor is rich.
They don't always obey their parents.
I go to any party I am invited to.
I'd like to be friends.
We hugged each other.
It was a nightmare.
This is for you.
Is there an elevator in this building?
The actor died at the height of his popularity.
This is the perfect Mother's Day gift.
You're fussy.
You work harder than anyone here.
The cat is very cute.
I told Tom I was going to handle it.
I'd like to ask you a question, but if this is a bad time, I can come back at another time.
Do you want to go get a drink?
Don't leave it up to chance.
The fact is that I have no money with me.
It may sound strange, but it is true.
The girl had grown up without any money and when she married she became a spendthrift.
I have an early memory of my grandmother darning socks.
She goes to school.
I don't know why I bother coming here.
I'm not ready to die.
I was deeply affected when I heard of his death.
What were you doing in that cave?
I was aware of being watched.
Thank you very much, doctor.
You've somehow managed to misconstrue what I have said.
We'll be there.
He would like to know whether you play chess.
I would very much appreciate receiving a copy of the book.
One stayed and the other went away.
You should have shown him the device.
I bought a newspaper written in English.
You can't blame this on me.
You can't give up.
I wouldn't want to lose my job.
Everything matters.
Thanks a lot for your help.
Do you mind if I take a day off?
Everybody plays the game of love.
I said he could go.
I knocked on the door, but there was no answer.
They ate and drank wine.
What's Tom doing with my car?
Keep focused on your work.
We went to see our neighbors.
He clipped the sheep.
I wish you would tell me what I ought to do in this difficult situation.
I'm going.
Have you ever wanted something so much that you'd do anything to get it?
Do you plan to go overseas?
He was surprised by the news.
She worships him and the ground he walks on.
Everybody in the building headed for the exits at the same time.
He gave body and soul to his job.
Did anybody call on you yesterday?
He skis in Hokkaido every winter.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
I didn't mean to disturb you.
They washed their hands.
This string is strong.
Why don't you go on a diet?
It's been nice meeting you.
How far is it from here to the station?
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
Studying how to communicate effectively is time well spent.
It'll happen.
An apple fell off the tree.
She believed him when he said he loved her.
He is bad at driving.
She was all smiles.
We're still married.
I'm starting to dislike her.
Seeing me, the baby began to cry.
If you guys aren't doing anything later, why don't you come over for a cup of coffee?
I think Tom is depressed.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Let's do the math.
I only read part of the report.
Something very strange is happening here.
You were hot, weren't you?
Ask them to help you.
Who's your boyfriend?
Don't push your luck.
Could you lean forward a bit?
A cat appeared from under the desk.
Are you the prophet?
There isn't any milk in the glass.
Tom knocked on Mary's bedroom window.
Come on, tell me.
If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while.
All men are created equal.
I do not think their plan will work out.
You can spend the night at our place.
There are many countries in Europe that I'd like to visit.
Wait until tomorrow.
We would move to a bigger house if we had more money.
Go home quickly.
I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.
I wish I had eaten lunch before I came here.
I don't think I can eat this.
Your office isn't as large as mine.
Tom wasn't allowed to tell Mary everything he knew.
Don't dismiss any possibility.
They seem to be having fun.
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
Could I use your phone?
Says who? "Says me."
She worships him and the ground he walks on.
There's a pyramid in Mexico bigger than any of those in Egypt.
Tom's new girlfriend is quite attractive.
He's as strong as a horse.
I've written several papers on this topic.
I don't know which button to push.
I don't want to suffer.
He didn't know what to do next.
Where's all that money going?
The storm had a serious effect on the economy.
They're armed.
I caught the flu.
I have to go to work now.
I made her cry.
He can swim fast.
It's because I love you.
The past is the past.
Come with me, please.
We love our parks.
Don't disappear on me again.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
Am I fully covered in case of an accident?
As we age, our ability to remember gets worse.
You'll have to discuss that with Tom.
Why is my sister so mean to me?
I'm not your brother.
We have different ways of thinking.
I just wanted to say thanks.
I just can't figure it out.
She appears to have many friends.
Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
They clung together for warmth.
I gave him my address.
The cat dug its claws into my hand.
I ran away.
We're volunteering.
How does the film end?
I only need one.
You're just like your mother.
I did not expect it to be that big.
The movie was interesting.
He found my bike.
How many people can fit in your car?
The moon is very beautiful this evening.
Are you a model?
My cat is white.
What has become of him since then?
Tom doesn't want to deal with this problem now.
You look positively ghastly.
One of the tigers has escaped from the zoo.
We know that they'll come.
I admire you for your courage.
It's five o'clock somewhere now.
It is the law.
What can I do to help you?
I have a lot of homework.
I hate being photographed.
I missed supper.
I've learned so much here.
I can't wait to see you.
How much longer is this storm going to last?
It's fun to learn slang words in foreign languages.
Where did you have in mind?
One roll of color film, please.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
We don't have any money.
I was not drinking.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
Bring the key.
I'm not sure I have enough time to clean my room before I go to school.
I'm not really mad at you.
There was no indication that anything was wrong.
The surgeon who operated on Tom is very experienced and highly regarded.
He found the door closed.
Harvard is a good university.
It was nowhere to be seen.
I made a pot roast.
Is flight 23 on time?
Let's go back to the motel.
It's all downhill from here.
Don't worry about your dog. I'll take care of him.
I'm not interested in your problems.
Tom isn't feeling well.
Tom took a book down from the shelf.
Please stay within earshot.
Tom committed crimes, but was never convicted.
Why aren't you taking notes?
I want to be worthy of your friendship.
Don't talk. They might hear us.
Who's winning?
You're a very sound sleeper.
Is this fake?
I can teach you how to do this.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
I have to sleep.
Show me the way, please.
The ship was scuttled last year.
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
We have to find another way to do that.
He heard footsteps.
Am I disturbing you?
Look behind you.
You must ask for permission.
Stop whining like a baby.
Non-members pay an additional 50 dollars.
That's terrible.
Men talk about women all the time.
Tom isn't good at math.
I don't want to stay.
I don't know what you really want.
I trusted my teacher.
I left on time.
Where are you planning to stay?
The concert will take place next Sunday.
Come on, don't be a coward!
I need you to go to the post office and mail this letter.
This is just a paperweight.
The ambulance went out of control and came close to running over a pedestrian.
These books aren't for children.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
I guess I was wrong.
There are a lot of things I want to ask you.
The U.S. incarceration rate is the highest in the world.
You're a doll!
Do you really want to get more done?
Give me three pieces of salmon.
We often watch TV while we're eating breakfast.
I got fined.
Can you imagine the world without money?
My uncle is a lousy driver.
That's my car.
The situation is getting worse every day.
I want to sing a song.
Tom didn't even know I was here.
I'll do it, if you insist.
I couldn't remember the title of that song.
He should have come.
I was told to be quiet.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
I never talked to him again.
I want to check out now.
Do you have a vacancy?
Take away this box.
Please bring the others.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Are you still upset about what happened?
I'm buying my sister a new hat.
I was counting on you.
She went on speaking.
We went as far as Kyoto.
What languages do you know?
I don't want you to panic.
Is your headache gone?
Tom didn't say anything at all.
Could you stop, please?
I don't want you to enjoy it.
That's enough. I don't want any more.
We hurried, so we didn't miss the last bus.
What do you know?
I want to show you what Tom gave me.
I'm the boss, aren't I?
She said that she was eager to go there.
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
He's my friend. Do you know him?
You should have seen it!
You seem a little tense.
The city wants to extend the road.
Are you in good health?
Just at that time, the bus stopped.
He ran so he would get there on time.
I'm a really bad dancer.
I teach here.
We cried together.
Please teach me French.
Is that all you want to say?
I'm asking what you think.
Tom barely speaks French.
She had a new dress made.
How are you now?
Give me a sec.
Tom decided to ask for Mary's help.
How long can I keep this book?
I think that Tom told you the truth.
I haven't heard that joke in a long time.
Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.
Germany then had a powerful army.
What else can go wrong?
He is the very man for the job.
Were you obedient?
It is very hot today.
She decided not to go.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
He said he was poor.
Does your girlfriend speak French?
We look forward to seeing you again.
Did you have breakfast?
I was told not to do that.
You should be proud of yourselves.
You hurt me.
Tom spends too much money.
How did you come by this painting?
I think everyone looks back on their childhood with some regret.
I'm glad you liked it.
Explain what that means.
I'm going to prison.
Does someone here speak French?
I think that he is honest.
Education is an investment in the future.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I was too astonished to speak.
Tom stopped the engine.
He had scarcely escaped when he was recaptured.
Their daughter is a nurse.
He's staying with his uncle.
Stop hitting your brother.
What do you do on Sundays?
I'm sorry I hurt you.
You don't have to answer.
I can't believe I'm graduating this year.
This guy deserves a medal.
Tom makes delicious cookies.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Do you have any cash?
I did so for the sake of my health.
That only makes the problem worse.
Who are these two boys?
They adopted the orphan.
That's what I thought you said.
Do you want to sell your house?
An arrest warrant was issued for the company's accountant.
He can't have been ill.
There must be something else we can do.
Talk to me!
Has Tom eaten yet?
He is madly in love with that girl.
I made a paper plane.
I'm making progress.
He left the Mexican capital to return to Texas.
Like I said, no problem.
Can you show me?
I need more.
Tom asked me to cut his hair.
I'm reading a letter.
She hit him.
Do you think we will get there on time?
You don't want to get married either, right?
He mentioned it.
Are you ready to leave?
Can't you keep your dog from coming into my garden?
I wish we could hear what Tom is saying.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
You have blood on your hands.
You'd better put on a raincoat.
The old man gave her a small doll.
What's your wish?
We should trust the experts.
That didn't work.
They want the best.
She was advised by him not to borrow money from his friends.
She gets hives when she eats eggs.
Are you getting much out of that book?
My mother allowed me to go abroad.
I bought the novel on which the film is based.
Tom likes to make paper airplanes.
I look forward to seeing you on my next trip to your city.
I am speechless.
I burst out laughing.
Both of the brothers are still living.
I outrank you.
Plastic bags are bad for the environment.
I'm not sure I have enough time to clean my room before I go to school.
How'd you do it?
I don't want to go back to Boston.
I'd like to help you reach your goals.
I didn't speak for long.
I'm expecting.
The cause of the accident is not known to us.
I was in the garden all afternoon.
Remember to answer his letter.
In politics there are no friends, only partners.
Is Tom actually in danger?
All the floors in her house are made of wood.
I am almost ready.
Are you a member of this crew?
What is your favorite animal?
That's unimportant.
They wash their hands with soap.
Now leave us.
I'm lucky to have a job.
I'll give this apple to whoever wants it.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
Have you tried this before?
I'm sorry that I didn't email you sooner.
You're extroverted.
He works too slowly to be helpful to us.
I'll step outside.
Tom will be very sad if Mary leaves.
I'm no friend of yours.
I really wish I didn't have to go to that meeting this afternoon.
This stone weighs five tons.
People were lined up around the block waiting for the theater to open.
Why do Tom and Mary fight so much?
She wore glasses.
I received an invitation.
Everyone cheered.
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
He kept badgering her until she told him what he wanted to know.
Have you seen anyone else?
I get along with everybody.
I don't know that much about you.
He's not like us.
Those are my orders.
It's very easy to use.
I didn't really feel like going out.
I own this property.
Don't hesitate to call if you need me.
Will you show me the picture?
Whose bike is this?
I know these people.
I lost my way in the woods.
You're the tallest person here.
From now on, I'll try to help you with the work.
How come you didn't come to the party?
Are you hurt?
There is a message for you.
The cat scratched my hand.
I'll support him.
You can't go outside.
He's not in yet.
I'd like you to have this.
Isn't that enough for you?
I promise you I'll come early.
You will find the restaurant on your right.
They must be cops.
They didn't see anything.
It is time to stop watching television.
We can't help Tom.
That's the danger.
I'll have it here for you tomorrow.
The door opens into the bedroom.
It's very surprising.
I don't particularly like her.
I had no idea you were so young.
My father was a teacher.
What happens now?
Don't ever do that again.
I'm not wasting my time.
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
We get on OK.
I figured you'd be impressed.
A long spell of rainy weather is harmful to plants.
Please be serious.
You're welcome.
Tom tried to leave.
Honesty pays in the long run.
Stay in bed.
We'll have breakfast at 6:30.
That's your responsibility.
I want these.
The Beatles set the world on fire with their incredible music.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
The neighbors called the police.
Tom doesn't like being criticized.
I want to learn karate.
They're mad at you.
I've almost finished listening to the album.
Since he was feeling sick, he stayed in bed.
Tom isn't good at keeping secrets.
We invited him to the party, but he did not show up.
Tom was third.
The wind died away.
You're very efficient.
I was hoping you'd know.
There is no reason for you to feel inferior to anyone.
You should have been more careful.
He's a tiger when he's angry is an example of metaphor.
Are you guys OK?
How did you lose it?
Did I miss much?
Tom led the attack.
My room number is 5.
Tom brought flowers.
Tom found my bicycle.
He left the house without so much as saying goodbye.
Can you stay?
He was there on business.
Tom and Mary are very hungry.
Try to have fun.
You didn't want me to starve, did you?
That one is all yours.
Did you volunteer us?
I don't know what you're waiting for.
Where do you get your ideas from?
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
Tom often comes to see me on weekends.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
I fell down really hard and got a black bruise on my knee.
The bus stopped suddenly in the middle of the street.
Please replace the empty ink jet cartridge in the printer.
Several guys were hanging around in front of the bar.
The chance is gone.
I need to know.
I miss all this.
I know you're right.
I've got nothing to lose.
I can't concentrate on that problem right now.
You aren't in any danger.
He arrived at the station out of breath.
Let me alone, she said angrily.
I have a little something for you.
Did you see that car?
Where did you meet my father?
I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager.
If you act like that, he'll think you hate him.
Variable names in C are case sensitive.
I forget to telephone him.
You probably already knew that.
Nobody insults my country.
We'll put you on the list.
She has lunch at home.
He is too short to get at the book on the shelf.
My wife is cooking right now.
I can't tell you where Tom lives.
Charge it to my account.
Can I talk to you for a second, please?
He's a man now.
Tom is a very dangerous man.
Did I not mention that?
Your handwriting is similar to mine.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
Perhaps you should buy a gun.
I know what Tom likes to drink.
Remind him to come home early.
It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
I'm a free man.
You're probably too young to understand this.
The bacteria that are transferred during a kiss help improve your immune system.
Tom did as Mary suggested.
Try this.
I'll let you do that.
We are all happy to help.
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
I can't change how tall I am.
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.
Give us a little space.
The outside of the castle was painted white.
What is that thing in your right hand?
She always fed her children before she fed her dog.
How do you know all these things?
Are you in any of those pictures?
I am badly in need of your help.
Where is the bus stop for the museum?
Don't worry about such a thing.
You must not go out at night.
This smells like cheese.
Do not sign a delivery receipt unless it accurately lists the goods received.
Her husband eats everything she puts in front of him.
I've always been very proud of that.
You're bright.
My mouth is numb.
She lived all her life in that town.
We have two girls and one boy.
Look in the mirror.
I hesitate to broach the subject with her.
Do you think I'm fat?
This is where it all happens.
You don't sound very confident.
Can you show me how this works?
Where did you put the newspaper?
You were afraid, weren't you?
I know you know where Tom is.
You look good in a kimono.
You're just like your father.
She really wants to go.
I felt a bit tired.
I think we've already wasted too much time.
I'm too sleepy to drive.
This is puzzling.
Make sure to back up all your files.
I think that's for Tom to decide.
I've been gone for a long time.
Tomorrow's a holiday.
This is outrageous.
I'd like to talk with you.
He had no more than 10,000 yen.
It's not a beauty contest.
I thought you were mad at me.
It will cost you $100 to fly to the island.
Let's clear this up right now.
Tom wanted to travel.
It's lost.
Can you make it safe?
Can you please tell me your name once more?
Tell me what really happened.
It seems to be a good house.
She was so angry that she could not speak.
I felt safer.
No one can tell what'll happen in the future.
Who wants it?
They can't be ignored.
Two families live in that house.
She treated him like a king.
I'm just going to go powder my nose.
It was sunny yesterday.
Many of the prisoners were decapitated.
I thought you were smart.
Learn Italian.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
I'll stay with Tom until you return.
It's just a matter of time.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
You see that tall building over there, don't you?
Follow your desire.
I know it's a lie.
Do you talk to your dog?
Was his story true?
When did you notice that?
Don't fall for his old tricks.
The train was delayed for an hour.
He doesn't know yet.
I wish you had come with us.
He will have to undergo an operation next week.
He left a large fortune to his son.
All I wanted was a little more attention.
Let me grab my bag.
Eat a live frog every morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.
We're doing all we can.
Nothing is ever right.
Do you feel like going out for a walk?
Use this.
I can't judge distance.
I have to study for the test.
He runs very fast.
I think you should leave Tom alone.
That's enough.
She tried to lower her expenses.
The soap hurt my eyes.
Do you have other family?
We're fasting.
I just want to be clear.
You are absolutely right.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
I guess both of us were lying.
I hear from my friend every year.
They agreed on everything.
The highway was blocked.
I really want to speak English fluently.
He is in love with her.
You should not speak so loud.
You're exposing yourself to a lot of criticism.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I ordered pizza.
That's a nice coat.
I'm on my way to visit a friend in the hospital.
You didn't let me finish.
He threw me the apple.
They probably didn't hear you.
Who are you talking about?
I often spend my free time listening to music.
Can we fix this?
Snow fell early this winter.
I'm not counting.
I guess I was wrong.
Return immediately.
We stopped for lunch at a local restaurant.
Many museums are closed on Mondays.
If you want to come, you can.
I wish I could help you.
May I sit next to you?
I had a great time.
Tom is going to make it on time.
I don't have to be here.
I just thought that you wouldn't want to go.
You're considerate.
Something is wrong with this calculator.
We offer low-cost prefabricated houses.
I wouldn't have made that mistake.
My dog is dreaming of a cat.
The joke's on you.
I was horrified.
The car Tom bought is red.
I'm sure there's another way out.
I was mentally and physically tired.
He's ruthless.
These things aren't mine!
I thought you might want to know.
You're the sweetest.
That's really not funny.
Don't you remember my name?
This knot will not hold.
I'll water the garden.
Let go of the handle.
My wife is obsessed with cleaning.
There's no other choice.
She is stubborn.
I got injured doing that.
How far is it from here?
You have no messages.
Do you want to cancel the meeting?
I shouldn't have done that.
How many hotels do you think there are in Boston?
He seldom, if ever, goes to church.
Is that so hard to do?
Tom often smiles.
Good job!
While you are asleep, the bodily functions slow down and body temperature falls.
He confessed that he was guilty.
We'll never catch Tom.
We appreciate your kind advice.
What did you do today?
He stole my heart.
I get goose bumps when I see a horror movie.
I don't know how to tell Tom this bad news.
I'm not joking.
What do you think of Mary's new dress?
Where did you meet your girlfriend?
The days are getting longer and longer.
You are big.
He put the key in the lock.
How did you kill the cockroach?
The moon is shining.
She's nice to me.
You're not a morning person, are you?
I need to get some sleep.
He is selfish and greedy.
You don't have to lie.
I spent the whole day reading that novel.
I just wanted to thank you again.
What position do you hold?
There is a possibility that we won't have to shut down the factory.
It's red.
I never saw you.
My career is on the line.
He has two daughters.
Do you think I'm ugly?
The freezer's in the garage.
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
You didn't want me to starve, did you?
Tom hasn't eaten at home in a long time.
Do you like fish?
He dropped in on me.
Please don't get angry.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
They're all here.
I don't know what to call you.
Those are my CDs.
They should be fine.
That's what I told her.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
My father is very strict with me.
They forgot to lock the door.
Are you still playing the guitar?
I like neither apples nor grapes.
You're being silly.
You're in no position to bargain.
I think it's very nice.
How big is your house?
At least give me a chance.
I slept on a park bench.
She'll be seventeen in February.
This dress is a good bargain.
I asked him if he would return soon.
Where did you put the TV guide?
They want you to resign.
If you're tired, rest.
The farmer plowed his field all day.
Tom does little other than play the guitar.
I'm telling the truth, Tom.
That car belongs in a museum.
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
Make some noise!
I suspect they water down the beer in that pub.
Be as quick as possible.
We've got better things to do with our time.
I felt bad about what I did.
That's just what you needed.
That sounds a little dangerous.
You ought to have taken your father's advice.
Many American planes were shot down.
She is a college student.
Tom forced me to go.
If you want to become thin, you should cut back on the between-meal snacks.
That never used to bother me.
I want you to follow orders.
You can't escape from reality.
The mountain is green.
If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
Were you busy?
All the flowers in the garden withered.
She had a blue dress on at the party yesterday.
Tom took off his shirt.
Tom pretended to be John.
I don't have the key.
He's good at cards.
Tom is grilling meat.
Would you please stop pacing around like that and just sit down for a second?
She does not like sushi.
Why don't you take your coat off?
I'm not going to try to do that today.
Trust me, you don't want to know.
My girlfriend was crying.
We caught the thief.
It's not impossible.
Don't worry. We have plenty of water and food.
As I told you before, I have no choice.
I've just finished my work.
Be merciful.
I know you don't like me.
You've got to hide.
You need to attach your photo to the application form.
I enlisted in the Air Force.
I don't live around here.
Are you expecting someone?
My hair is greasy.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
We ate some apples.
He stopped the car.
I still think we should've invited Tom to go with us.
She looked at the picture.
You're so sweet.
Tom is our best pilot.
I really don't think that's a good idea.
If only I'd been a little more careful!
Tom's family is powerful.
All of us stared at her.
Maybe he likes you, too.
Tom washes his car once a week.
We had a rest in the shade.
I hate pretending I'm interested.
He is scheduled to come up to Tokyo tomorrow.
Tom entered the restaurant where he eats about three times a week.
I'm all packed and ready to go.
I never thought of that.
She turned her old dress into a skirt.
I have an earache.
Will you open the door?
I need this more than you.
Could you be more specific?
In order to serve you better, your call may be monitored.
I don't have a key.
You had better take a bath to get warm.
You found something they didn't.
He's the black sheep of the family.
Did you know him well?
He's no saint.
Parallel lines do not intersect each other.
Does anybody need anything?
Tom quit smoking.
Do those insects sting?
I can't feel it.
I love walking barefoot on the grass.
The pain of the compound fracture was almost unbearable.
Tom is leaving Kobe tomorrow morning.
Pour me a drink.
He smiled and left.
My father is busy.
Can I use my credit card?
Did you agree to do it?
What could they possibly want us to do?
I asked Tom to wait a moment.
How does it work?
We're the same size.
I want you back.
How did you come up with that answer?
We're better off without you.
It doesn't look too hard.
Their house is far from the station.
Come with me now.
He knows a lot about wild animals.
My dad gave up alcohol.
Who's your favorite movie director?
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
Watch your mouth or you'll get it.
It just doesn't count.
It's way past your bedtime.
I missed the bus.
He taught me how to write a poem.
Maybe we should do that.
The trees will soon be bare.
I should tell Tom I'm tired.
The dog will not harm you.
Could I talk to you, Tom?
I want to try it.
I have to stop.
I can't bear to see her cry.
I was off duty at that time.
Tom is looking ill.
You're not leaving until I say it's OK.
Hiking is a good exercise.
Get out of the way.
That's why I sent for you.
I was devastated.
Why didn't you come to ask me earlier?
I know you feel bad.
Do you consider yourself a good guitarist?
What is love?
Tom and Mary don't want to talk to John.
This book is too large to go in my pocket.
They were tired of waiting.
Will you be hiring any part-time help?
Tom abandoned that idea.
I had my eyes checked.
You shouldn't have followed me.
To tell the truth, I drove my father's car without his permission.
They've had a talk.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere before.
He had trouble breathing.
There were no radios in Japan in those days.
Does Tom still play the guitar?
She plays the piano by ear.
You're very helpful.
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
He's studying.
You know, I had a lot of fun.
It's not ridiculous.
Did you think that I'd forgotten that?
Do you want to know who helped?
Are we ready?
Search everyone who comes into this room.
Please mail this letter on your next trip to the post office.
Do you want me to call the police?
Tom went straight to bed.
Did you enjoy your meal?
The prosperity of a country depends upon its citizens.
My girlfriend is from Boston.
Tom is fat.
He denied having met her.
We'll work on it.
Where did the other girls go?
How do you like the climate of Japan?
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
What were you waiting for?
Do you mind if I join you?
She worked for a rich man.
Do you want me to explain it again?
Give us everything you have.
She can swim.
What you're doing makes me nervous.
They just want to get to know you.
I don't know how to reach you.
Do you feel like going swimming?
I'll follow you wherever you go.
We have nothing to lose.
What time is it?
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
Tom doesn't think I'm interested in what he does.
Don't put the wet towel in the bag.
Tom has willingly done everything we've asked him to do.
As a matter of fact, I dislike him.
You're not even paying attention.
I was in the hospital a few days ago.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
Have you ever been in love?
Tom said that Mary died in her sleep.
I, too, didn't understand anything.
Tom overslept.
I think we've got it figured out now.
Would you like something to eat?
I need a stamp.
Are you sure they can do this?
I heard a noise.
You can always count on me.
I follow orders.
This dog eats almost anything.
She is a good friend of mine.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Why don't you take off your coat?
These products are selling like hot cakes.
Tom asked me if I liked Chinese food.
What kinds of beers do you have?
I'll be back tonight.
She trusted you.
He did what he promised to do for me.
I have simply nothing to say about it.
Keep off the grass!
I said nothing.
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof.
Lay it on the table.
That made me laugh.
He's a grouch.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
He's going to have a heart attack.
The two towns are separated by a river.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
That company puts out a magazine, doesn't it?
Tom isn't rude, but Mary is.
This is so boring.
They're cool.
I'm from the East Coast.
I hope this fine weather holds.
I hate the color of these walls.
Don't judge me.
I want for you and me to be happy.
He asked me for more money than was necessary.
I go to the office by bicycle except on rainy days.
Have you received a letter from him?
Keep your room as neat as you can.
We're biased.
Keep it in mind for the next time.
We have to acknowledge that.
I feel your pain.
He loves animals.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
Nothing's going to happen.
Tom has dyed his hair black.
He left the box unprotected.
He is extremely pessimistic and has no aspirations.
You've worked hard.
Each of them was given a prize.
I could hear doors slamming.
They left very early in the morning.
All I want to do is close my eyes and get some sleep.
Do you want to join me for lunch?
About how much money do you have?
The car wasn't making that noise before.
A hungry man is an angry man.
Tom won't come today.
Tom dreams of owning a house in the center of Boston.
The train gathered speed.
Can you at least pretend you're enjoying yourself?
Can you wake me up at seven o'clock tomorrow morning?
Your remarks were out of place.
It's been a while, hasn't it?
You did that intentionally, didn't you?
We're not going.
We ate breakfast at seven.
He has a headache.
I have no idea what Tom intends to do.
Why is your mouth so big?
The car's tires were caked with dried mud.
I wish I had a million dollars.
Thanks for photocopying it for me.
I'd be delighted.
He did all the legwork.
I am your friend, right?
His advice counted for little.
You may have to do that yourselves.
You're the only friend I have.
I didn't know that Tom was Mary's grandson.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
I know what they'll want me to do.
They clung together for warmth.
How about tomorrow?
She avoided answering my questions.
I've got a friend at the IRS.
Is there anybody here you don't know?
They huddled together.
She is very bitter toward me.
Psychology deals with human emotions.
We'll help.
He can't be older than I am.
He was about to apologize when the man punched him in the face.
I'd be happy to work with you.
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
What would you like?
I will accompany you.
Production is low.
This is fine.
You might meet him.
Your question is hard for me to answer.
Tom can't have gone very far.
When is a good time for you?
What are you two conspiring about?
I'm looking forward to going to the zoo with you.
He quickly scanned the page for the word he was looking for.
I appreciate your vigilance.
It's an old picture.
Breakfast is served.
Don't you like Chinese food?
I don't have a lot of time right now.
You need to be more careful.
Tom never knew his father.
I have bad news for you.
She was impatient to know his address.
Do you know what time they came?
She may come.
Let me introduce myself.
She has never visited him.
She has a rich vocabulary of English words.
It only takes a few minutes.
They were worried about getting caught.
I'd do anything for you.
I think we should all go together.
Do not fear the unexpected, but be prepared for it.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
I need to go home.
She advised him to do more exercise.
I like the smell of bread just out of the oven.
If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while.
You're one of them, aren't you?
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
You don't have to respond.
He is fond of adventure.
The intersection where the accident happened is near here.
Tom's grandfather couldn't read.
I have bruises all over my body.
Tom isn't going to be happy to see me.
Could you keep an eye on my suitcase for a moment?
I took part in the discussion.
I was young and strong back then.
Be confident.
A leading specialist was brought in to authenticate the painting.
We're stubborn.
Where were all of you?
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.
Do you like apple pies?
He always takes his time in everything that he does.
I've already finished eating.
I'd forgotten all about that.
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
He's my best friend.
The report turned out to be false.
She smiled and said goodbye.
I'll talk.
I'm well acquainted with Tom.
All the seats are occupied.
No matter what happens, you must not give up.
She can't cook well.
I want to believe there's still a chance for us to be happy together.
This is something I must face alone.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
You need to let go.
She killed herself by taking poison.
What should we cook?
He gave the same answer as before.
Really?
It's my day off.
I could eat a horse.
They went crazy.
Our financial problems are serious.
I feel like I know you already.
I've fixed the radio for him.
It's already 7 o'clock.
They have no natural predators.
This is a hybrid.
I wonder what I'll find in the box.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Are you the girl Tom has been dating?
I've got to get back home by midnight.
Could you make a reservation for me?
Put your pants on.
There's a place I'd like to show you.
Put the question in writing.
I made it myself.
My dream is to become a pilot.
I like your tie.
We must hurry if we want to arrive at the station on time.
He was very kind to invite me to his birthday party.
It was so good.
You're kind of cute.
I don't know what he'll do.
He suspects me of telling a lie.
Who planted these trees?
This wasn't cheap, was it?
Don't be so shy.
Is there anyone else around?
Sony is a brand known around the world.
I'm a non-native speaker of English and realize there is a lot that I still need to learn.
It would mean a great deal to me if you would stay.
What keeps you up so late?
I wasn't prepared for it.
Now we wait.
Are all these books yours?
May I eat something?
He doesn't love me.
Could you tell me who did this?
You don't have to be so formal.
I totally disagree.
Write at least 250 words.
Is he still alive?
Always look on the bright side of life.
You were in danger.
You never tell me anything.
He promoted the idea of world government.
He was late for the 7:30 bus.
I know Tom is still busy.
I'll explain to you how to use it when I come back.
Let me get this straight.
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
I hope you have a good trip.
My ideas are different from yours.
He is the chief of my department.
Our school burned down.
I think that you're mistaken.
Show me how to do this.
What's life like where you live?
She must be over eighty.
He seems to have left the country.
It appeared that he meant what he said.
We have to respect local customs.
They approve.
I must hand in the report today.
Why don't you ride with me?
I want something cold to drink now.
A lot of fish perished.
That's weird, isn't it?
I hope you enjoyed the long weekend.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain and the man soon died.
We sometimes see them.
I don't talk to them anymore.
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
Do you have to go now?
Safety is the primary concern.
I was watching.
What happened to that friend of yours that you introduced me to last weekend?
He was overwhelmed by the intensity of her love.
Can I borrow your scissors?
He took advantage of the opportunity.
There was not enough fuel.
You missed a lot.
Clearly you're not interested.
Have you read that book?
I am acquainted with the author.
We need to take that risk.
He made a joke about it.
I want something to read.
His attempt to escape was successful.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Hollywood isn't what it used to be.
I feel well.
Not knowing what to do, I telephoned the police.
It's secret.
I should've said that.
Do you want to come eat at our house?
I would just like to thank all of you for your work.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Your approval is not required.
You don't want to keep him waiting.
We won't have much time.
How could I refuse?
Tom didn't know anything about Mary's past.
This is a bus stop.
I know Tom wanted to meet you.
People say that Japan is the richest country in the world.
My uncle gave me this watch.
I had to lend to him money.
I don't like the way she laughs.

I'm afraid that you're in danger.
Wow! You've lost a lot of weight.
Some people think that advertising is a form of brainwashing.

You will listen.
Just stay away from my daughter.

I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
I doubt Tom knows Mary.
I have seen her before.
I can lend you some money if you need some.
I've never been to Europe.
How is your business going?
Tom can't help himself.
Have you met any Canadians here in Boston?
There'll come a day when you'll regret it.
Count to thirty.
Tom couldn't contain his anger.
Can you catch the chicken?
I know you're in love with me.
Are you jealous?
I was right behind Tom.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
I haven't had time to look for what you wanted.
We've made good progress.
Today is not your day.
It's quite large.
This tastes moldy.
I walk to school every day.
We should do away with this regulation.
Tom eats mostly fruits and vegetables, and only eats meat about once a week.
What do you like to do?
I don't need any help.

We have four French classes a week.
I know I've been acting strangely.

I'm not going to explain it to you.
She seems to be in trouble. Tell her what to do.
What do you make of all this?
Could you verify that your computer is plugged in?

They found no such proof.
Do you always greet people that way?
What foods do you avoid eating?
I'd prefer that you stay home tonight.
I like your house.
My brother makes it a rule to look over the newspaper before going to his office.
I swore.
I will play football tomorrow.
He became a pianist.
I think it's impossible.
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
Don't ever make me wait again.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
Can you tell me what this word means?
As soon as he went out of the house, it began to rain.
That's a big fat lie.
You are always doubting my word.
Get me out of here.
The man was a fountain of knowledge.
I tried flying from the top of the tree.
Tom has to follow our rules.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
We went to the mountains to ski.
Do you remember seeing me before?
He got the first prize.
We surrendered.
I'm fair.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
We're not getting any younger.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
He has given up smoking for the sake of his health.
I have some very sad news.
He was egging an innocent young man on to join him in his crooked deal.
Stop beating around the bush.
You must be cautious.
Tensions were increasing.
I'm a little drunk.
She went to the hairdresser's.
Hold my hand.
Tom is the one who broke the window yesterday.
You're funny.
Let's hope next year will be better.
I can imagine how you felt.
I don't want to talk about this now.
He is very careful.
The policemen wore gas masks and helmets.
I need a new one.
It has to be removed.
I'd like to have a word with you.
I feel like I know you already.
I realized what was happening.
Tom liked what he saw.
I haven't decided.
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
I want to know what to expect.
We have mutual friends.
Where are they taking you?
He let us go.
I just got here last week.
What do you have in mind?
He is absorbed in the study of Latin.
What day are you usually free?
I just can't help worrying about you.
You aren't going to tell on me, are you?
We did all we could do.
That's embarrassing.
I suppose you have some ideas on how to handle this matter.
Tom isn't bothering anybody.
This movie is rated R.
Tom doesn't want any coffee.
Let's have a drink.
I have to run.
How did you get here so fast?

This is highly unusual.
It has been many years since she died.
Why don't you sing?
Grab the bottom.
It was quite dark when I got home.
I do have one request.
We discussed the problem for a long time.
I first met him three years ago.
I couldn't bring myself to take the job.
I like it when you do that.
You've gotta get over there right now.
I bet you're a great teacher.
I like all of the songs Tom sings.
What was the cause of the accident?
Yesterday I played tennis for the first time.
Tom was arrested as a suspect in a criminal case.
I am off duty tomorrow.
What time is your plane landing?
That meat is chicken.
Where's the newspaper?
Would you be willing to write a letter for me?
Why don't you try doing that again?
I've met people like that.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
Get out of here! All of you!
Where's the closest pharmacy?
I don't belong here.
Someone just turned off the lights.
I don't like his hat.
I met someone the other day that I think I could fall in love with.
Answer Tom.
He did both at the same time.
I don't know what that means.
I'm beginning to lose patience.
Last Sunday, Mary and I went to the library together.
I must make up for lost time.
Don't leave them alone.

It's too hot.
Tom will spend Christmas Eve with his family.
Have you fed the dog?
I'm a black belt in karate.
What did he look like?
Tell me how I can help you.
They forced me to take the medicine.
Have you made up your mind what you're going to give Tom for his birthday?
I wish I had married her.
All major credit cards are accepted.
Individual freedom is the foundation of democracy.
You should take the time to do that.
It's not a computer problem.
You don't understand women, Tom.
These items must be returned to their rightful owner.
I emptied the dishwasher.
If you behave like a lackey, you'll be treated like a lackey.
He was English.
This is a road map.
I've already filed my report.
I didn't plan to hit Tom.
He is no friend of mine.
Do you have to go there every day?
Most snakes on this island are harmless.
We have to work now.
How many more are there?
I knew Tom would kiss you.
What was that thing?
Come along with us.
Come downstairs as soon as possible.
I belong to the sailing club.
Tom tried climbing the tall tree.
I have read that story in some book.
I quite agree.
I think it's time to take a break.
We are not short of oil in this country.
What was it that you gave him?
I can't hear you well.
If we were supposed to talk more than listen, we would have been given two mouths and one ear.
Tom's innocent.
He has two sons, I believe.
That's news to me.
Get in the van.
Come on, grow up.
It's up to you to decide whether we'll go there or not.
It is raining hard.
We looked around the property.
Tom is a bit under the weather.
I can explain this.
She is bad-mannered.
I need more blankets.
I get a lot of satisfaction out of my work.
I'm looking for your sister. Where is she?
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
I agreed with Tom.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
I stopped by your place the other day.
What scared you?
It's easy to do that.
He's not going.
Let's play hide and seek.
Do you like studying?
The town was destroyed by the flood after the storm.
I'd rather stay home and sleep all day.
I'll make you proud of me.
How much is your hourly pay?
My cousin is getting married tomorrow.
That's all I can say at the moment.
Not a sound was heard.
I'm impressed with your French.
He wondered why she did not come.
I'd like to talk to Tom myself.
My feet get cold.
Who cares when she gets married?
I figured that you'd be impressed.
I've known Tom for about three years.
You're my only real friend.
I want to learn to play the guitar like you.
I loved going to the beach.
Is that what you really want?
You're really selfish.
Do you have an opinion?
They are all college students.
Young people tend to take things too far.
I do know it isn't right.
I'm beautiful.
It looks good on you.
We have a very important decision to make.
I was right behind you.
This is your chance.
He is nothing but a child.
We'll soon learn all we need to know.
Tom wanted to be a better teacher.
After the storm, it was calm.
I have a few minutes to spare.
He exhausted all his energy.
I like watching movies in French.
Don't lose hope.
What right do you have to order us around?
I need help now.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
I want you to run to the store for me.
I had been reading for an hour.
What time did your friend go home?
Would you like to travel to the United States?
Tom retires next spring.
I was one of the skeptics.
Why are you busy today?
They are crazy about jazz.
When I opened the curtains, it was snowing.
The apricot trees are in full blossom.
Everything has changed.
He drew a chair near her.
I hate hypocrites.
You don't have to answer.
Do you agree with Tom?
May I put it down here?
You should have told him.
Would you mind leaving the room for a few minutes so I can ask your son some questions?
I never read that book.
I can be there in ten minutes.
You won't be the first.
I should've locked the door.
Do as you please.
Are you sure there's no meat in this soup?
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
I don't want to drive.
I really am glad you're here.
All happy families resemble each other, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
The public at large are dissatisfied with the present government.
I have known that for a long time.
I'm not narrow-minded.
Could you find out how to get there?
It could have been me.
Do your parents know about this?
I thought that he was angry.
You go first.
This is creepy.
I allowed her to go to the party.
We played on the beach.
Why are you acting this way?
Food will be included.
I think it's time for me to abandon that plan.
Let's ask them.
They named the baby Momotarou.
I want to write my girlfriend a love letter in French.
I want you to be prepared.
I'll give you a hint.
You've put on a little weight, haven't you?
I heard someone come in.
We watched a baseball game on television.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
Tom's cat had nine kittens.
The cat is black.
I'm going to sleep on it.
This day will go down in history.
You have no need to be ashamed.
I didn't know you could cook this well.
Tom talks about that a lot.
Tom tried to lift the box.
That's not all I learned.
Do you have any more of those?
I don't need a boyfriend.
It's your book.
Put your coat on. It's cold outside.
The Medieval Era gave way to the Renaissance.
My children rarely go outside.
Who's this hot babe?
There they go again.
This laptop belongs to me.
What did he say?
Have you had dinner?
I've got to speak to you.
I figured you would understand.
Look into the box.
I'm not a saint.
I am not certain about that.
Where are you heading?
What did you turn up?
I'd like to help, but I can't.
They didn't listen.
I read the newspaper every day when I was in college.
He looks tired this evening.
You must be in good physical condition.
I quit a long time ago.
I was about to call you.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
I am sure I met him somewhere, but I do not remember who he is.
I am yours and you are mine.
The teacher got well again.
Where were you that whole time?
What you don't know won't hurt you.
Just give me what I want.
Brush your teeth.
I'm far from happy about this situation.
My father came home at nine.
This is a very small book.
Tom is busy making breakfast for his family.
He lives by himself in the woods.
The couple broke off their engagement.
I got lost in the forest.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Please give me something to eat.
I hope your wishes will come true.
Wait here. I'll be back soon.
That's not a good sign.
As long as I'm going to be in London, I ought to see a play or two.
I usually buy my clothes at the department store.
Tom was quite pleased with himself.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
You are lying.
What's this chair doing here?
He showed us a beautiful hat.
No one works there anymore.
They don't know me there.
A rush-hour traffic jam delayed my arrival by two hours.
Let's ponder that for a moment.
You can't take that with you.
They let me go.
I don't understand why it happened.
Where do you get off telling me that?
You need to be more patient.
Tom is a very good guitarist, isn't he?
What line of work are you in?
This book is about stars.
Tom doesn't want us to leave.
It began to snow.
Who lives in the room below?
I've got to catch some Z's.
Her car broke down on the way.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
Which one of those is yours?
The princess begged forgiveness from the emperor.
My stomach hurts.
Can I talk to you in private?
The cat climbed up the tree.
Do you have any soft drinks?
What are you going to do this evening?
We have to return to the ship now.
You're very forward.
I like things done properly.
My shoes are the same size as his.
Love will prevail.
She died yesterday.
You're very understanding.
Who's the person sitting at the other end of the table?
You should have seen me.
I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind.
Can we speak French?
Tom was reading a book.
Can you loan her some money?
A really bad thing happened to him.
Can I persuade you to stay a few more days?
We need to do it immediately.
Some guy named Tom said he was looking for you.
My new shoes are comfortable.
I refuse to obey you any longer.
I don't remember that at all.
If you eat too much, you'll become fat.
Would you like to freshen up?
I don't know anybody by that name.
You must learn from your mistakes.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
Did you like the movie?
All the students look up to him.
It was a trick question.
Give me your gun.
This is the church where Blake is buried.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
I can see right through you.
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
This city is 1,600 meters above sea level.
His appearance deceived me.
The news confirmed my suspicions.
What were you doing at that time?
Why not try that delicious wine?
We make a great team.
I am yours and you are mine.
I'm thrilled.
This medicine has no side effects.
I'd like to reserve a table for two.
Do you need a few minutes?
She wants to read a book.
You really don't have a clue, do you?
I think Tom needs your help.
Can we afford it?
Easy come, easy go.
He got angry.
Let's take a break for coffee.
I think I'm going crazy.
He called his mother up from the airport.
Let's not be too hasty.
He's a jesuit.
I'm naked.
I can easily convince you of his innocence.
This suit is anything but cheap.
A boat suddenly appeared out of the mist.
You're not cooperating.
The girl got distracted and lost sight of her parents.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
The owners appointed him manager.
You know where to find me.
He bought himself a new car.
I wish you hadn't told me.
He was accompanied by his wife.
I didn't get much sleep last night so I was nodding off all day at work.
They arrived too soon.
Life has its ups and downs.
I built it.
We all make mistakes.
I have something I have to do.
What surprised me most was that she didn't like candy.
Tom warned me it would be noisy here.
See to it that all the doors are locked before you go out.
He blamed others for his own failure.
That belongs to us.
I've got to win this race.
There are many housewives who complain about high prices.
You play the guitar very well.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
Aren't you going to take your coat off?
Are you a ghost?
Do they take care of the dog?
He began to feel ill.
I have a few friends here.
He asked me if I could do him a favor.
I don't have a white shirt.
You have no idea who that is, do you?
Who asked Tom to sing?
Are you able to swim well?
Two teas and a coffee, please.
They sell various kinds of goods at that store.
Tell me what I should be watching for.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
Who yelled?
They're right behind you.
I asked Tom what he wanted to do.
We closed the restaurant three years ago.
She was hit by a car.
He is studying in the library now.
I gave him a few books.
I need your advice.
The station is two miles away.
That happened to my friend.
Tom showed Mary the ropes.
I have seen the film before.
Have you ever been there?
Are you busy?
We'll be back in an hour.
I'm just as confused as you are.
What if I told you I really want to be a teacher?
They know we're here.
I should read the book.
I'm delighted to meet you.
Do you know what color she likes?
Could you tell me where I can get a train?
That house is very small.
Young people are prone to fall into temptation.
It's a bit warm in here, isn't it?
She mistook the sugar for salt.
She came into the room with her hat on.
We'll meet again.
What's your excuse?
Nobody trusts Tom anymore.
I think we should all go outside.
I've got a question.
I made up my mind to go there.
He denied it.
It can be difficult.
There is enough time to finish this homework.
He failed in business, and to make matters worse, his wife fell ill.
I never told anybody about it, I swear.
This is how you do it.
She couldn't convince him to ride a horse.
What have you done?
Tom refused to sign the document.
I am good.
It is not difficult to speak English.
I don't do all that much.
Young people must respect the law.
Drive slowly.
French isn't a difficult language.
Tom likes them.
I'm not as busy as Tom.
You're the only person that I can trust.
Sometimes I hear things.
You're amusing.
I've got a sweet tooth.
Do you know who I am?
He was a member of the Republican Party.
I want to know what that is.
He's with his parents.
How much are the lilies?
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.
The angry mob overturned cars and smashed storefront windows.
Tom was humiliated.
All the villagers went out into the hills to look for a missing cat.
You should make sure that you don't make Tom angry.
Who put a frog in my bed?
I just want to know who's in the room.
She did nothing but cry all the while.
I learned to drive a car and got a driver's license when I was eighteen.
How could this be?
That's how I did it.
We talked about time zones.
That is too expensive.
Do we have a babysitter for tonight?
Tom has friends all over the world.
Go away. I'm busy.
How long have you been using this toothbrush?
I ran into a friend on the bus.
After the war, he managed to escape to South America.
How are you connected?
Does she play tennis? "Yes, she does."
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
We're planning a party.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
She made me hurry.
Did you see anyone?
Let's go to the picnic.
It's dangerous for a beginner to swim here.
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
Can anyone believe you?
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
You're surrounded.
He bought me a nice camera.
It's for my science project.
I can't really remember.
Green suits you.
I'm satisfied with his progress.
He should have worked harder.
Why should we study economics?
I guess that's the solution.
I'm not afraid of death.
We don't think the job is done.
Don't get off the train till it stops.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
I was getting worried.
I'll set you free.
He was having lunch when I entered the room.
Is there anyone who speaks English?
You're so naive.
I am sure of his success.
Why are you ignoring me?
Somebody must care for the patient.
I wonder why karaoke is so popular.
I had no idea you felt that way.
Those old laws were all done away with.
I'll show you around the town.
That's where you're mistaken.
I spent all afternoon shopping.
Do you mind if we join you?
Was there an earthquake?
I have my own theory.
You can park on either side of the street.
Look up the word in the dictionary.
It was too hard.
His children have grown up.
I'm feeling very confident.
I am very glad to meet you today.
I forgot to tell them.
He refused to do so.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
She is talking.
All the lights went out.
There was a sudden change in the situation.
What happened to you?
What did your wife say?
I can't even lift this small box.
That's the main gate.
Could I get one more beer, please?
I had a raincoat on so I didn't get so wet.
I'm glad you appreciated that.
Get off the train immediately.
You can stay in the extra bedroom if you want.
Poaching is illegal.
I think his name is Tom.
I finally found out what had been causing the pain in my leg.
King Solomon was known for his wisdom.
I'm very drawn to you.
It made me laugh out loud.
My hair's too long.
They're mine.
Neither of those things happened.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
He has two daughters, both married.
I felt as if I were in a dream.
Flowers make her happy.
You could do a lot if you put your mind to it.
Is Tom jealous?
My father has gone to America.
She closed her eyes.
You're too slow.
For the time being, I am studying French at this language school.
What's this used for?
I really don't need any help.
Tom took a book down from the shelf.
I want you to have a copy of this.
He got a prize for winning the competition.
The military quashed the revolt within a matter of hours.
Each of us has to be careful when driving.
I'm wondering if I love him.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
I still think so.
I was trying to say something when you so rudely interrupted.
He called me up almost every day.
We imported this from Australia.
She's depressed.
The robber ran away when the policeman saw him.
You would be safe there.
I'm leaving tonight for Australia.
I was shocked to see this.
We worked together.
We will only consent on that condition.
I have been to the airport to see him off.
You're driving me nuts.
The article was written in French.
I have a delivery for you.
My brother doesn't swim.
He put a stamp on the letter.
I bought a pair of boots.
Is this your girlfriend?
You're fashionable.
Tom and Mary won't go without me.
I got home a little late last night.
Do you want some water?
Do you want any of these flowers?
I'm not so sure.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
Workaholics view holidays as a waste of time.
Don't make me go back there.
Are you still in love?
What did you make?
What are the doctor's office hours?
We met before.
There is a traffic jam on the highway.
Please don't waste my time.
I can't wait to go to college.
Is that really appropriate?
You're so sweet.
I could've done that, but I didn't.
I hadn't considered not going to the meeting.
I have to cook the vegetables.
Go away right now!
This car has no air conditioning.
Eat more fruit.
We'd like you to sing a song.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
When I got out of jail, I had no intention of committing another crime.
I really don't know how to dance.
He gave us an essay to write during the vacation.
I know Tom is a doctor.
I did that because everyone else did.
I want everything.
The boy got his hands dirty.
Can I see that one?
I need to talk with you.
Tom acted as if he didn't know us.
How do you make a box?
This is my family.
I made an appointment to see him at seven o'clock.
I don't think that's allowed here.
I know now what I have to do.
It's still in good condition.
I took it for granted that you would join.
I used to think it didn't really matter what I fed my dog.
She unbuttoned her shirt.
You have to do it, whether you like it or not.
What are you all doing?
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
Don't throw away this magazine.
I don't really understand you.
I want to go over these numbers with you.
Go up the stairs.
Could you please reschedule the meeting at a time that is convenient for you?
It's not a secret anymore.
Tom was here before I was.
Thank you for your kindness.
I was at home almost all day yesterday.
When did you get married?
Several people are sleeping in the next room.
When did the robbery take place?
Well, it's complicated.
I bribed them.
I didn't say it was easy.
What did you think of the movies we saw yesterday?
Tom was the only one who laughed.
Wonderful!
I can walk to school in ten minutes.
Winds from the sea are humid.
I don't think I can do that.
Please tell me what that is.
Show me your passport, please.
I simply don't know.
We need a volunteer.
Learn to walk before you run.
I want this luggage taken to my room at once.
He lost all of his money.
I don't want you two talking about me.
Somebody must care for the patient.
We need a new leader.
Tom is headed towards Boston.
They enjoyed themselves.
Don't look away.
That's why I'm a bachelor.
I'll make tea for you.
Do you want to look at it?
He will soon get used to the climate here.
We saved you a seat.
Tom decided to take a chance.
I want to hear you say it.
What should I do in order to save time?
Her red dress made her stand out.
You're not bruised.
I can't thank you enough.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
The bell has not rung yet.
He has a crush on this girl.
Do you have anything to do tonight?
Why don't you sit and have a drink with me?
We heard gunshots.
There must be some way we can help Tom.
The medicine worked marvels.
That's certainly possible.
Let's just leave it at that.
I'm focusing on my job.
I don't know how to draw a bird.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
I like to drink natural mineral water.
Seriously?
He received quite a few letters this morning.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.
Why should I pay that much?
Will you look after my baggage?
Tom is sad.
When does the next train leave?
I want to know what you'll do.
Who are you there with?
Tom said he couldn't remember his own phone number.
Tom plays the piano.
She parked her car in a vacant lot.
What did I do wrong?
He fetched a few cushions to prop up her head.
I must buy a new winter coat.
I feel like I'm wasting my time.
I've had a busy week.
It is sunny today.
We don't have a lot of trouble.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
Can I get you something to drink?
May I borrow your lighter?
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
Does that sound weird?
Lock the door.
It was very hot this afternoon.
It's difficult to help people that don't want your help.
Tom isn't old enough to smoke.
Tom will probably hurt you.
The geyser sends up a column of hot water every two hours.
What did you do at school today?
I think that you and I should probably be able to get along better.
You are twice as strong as I am.
That might depend on your point of view.
I love this chair.
I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
Don't go out in this heat without wearing a hat.
Your plan worked.
The bar was so crowded you could hardly move.
Her parents love me.
I'm tired of being treated like a kid.
You're powerful.
Tom seems to know the way.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I'm going to have to dye my hair.
The job is not suitable for young girls.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
His story is strange, but it's believable.
I'll do my best not to cause any trouble.
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
He explained the matter to me.
I've never eaten anything like this before.
Are you going to do your homework this afternoon?
Everything is going very well.
I think I'm in love.
Take a deep breath and then relax.
I am divorced.
That job is impossible for me to do.
I know that.
Please be polite.
I appreciate you coming here.
Tom wants to stay single.
There are many tall buildings in that town.
When are you going back to your own country?
What kind of camera does Tom own?
Did you break up with Tom or did he break up with you?
She didn't try to evade the truth.
This is what'll happen.
Have you received a letter from him?
I feel better today, but I am not well enough to work.
I was paraphrasing.
Tom was in high spirits.
We shouldn't judge people based on their appearance.
Is Tom always like this?
Am I wasting my time?
You seemed to like that.
That applies to him too.
What's your name?
Do you think I'm healthy?
Why are you flinching?
Tom never gives anything to anybody.
These shoes are way too small for me.
Go ahead.
I want my stuff.
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
Was I polite enough?
Tom doesn't have any reason to be jealous.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
Do I annoy you?
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
Which kind of watch do you prefer, digital or analog?
Throw it to Tom.
If I had wings, I would fly to you.
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
They live in a rundown tenement on 5th St.
He doesn't have a computer.
Tom didn't want this to happen.
That is good to me.
After some hesitation, he laid the book on the desk.
You're not that old.
We make a good team.
The airport is closed.
Is he really the man you're looking for?
Turn to the right.
I shouldn't have slept in.
They caught him stealing.
For goodness' sake, please be nice to him.
We'll all be here for you.
I really think we should talk.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
She doesn't want him to pick the flowers.
I've never seen something like this.
He drank three glasses of water.
I am going to a concert next week.
Did you hear that sound?
Tom is never at a loss for words.
How do I get to the bus station?
I just wanted to make sure everyone was awake.
Do you want another one of these?
He had his head in the clouds in class.
I didn't say I was completely satisfied.
The doctor gave me a shot.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
She was similar to me in many ways.
You're very sophisticated.
I will find you a good doctor.
I've never eaten Chinese food before.
I hope he's all right.
It's irrelevant.
It's the size of a small car.
I don't really understand what just happened.
You must get going.
We appreciate your hard work.
Tom is my twin brother.
I don't know how to reply to that question.
There's something I wanted to give you.
Are you going by bus or car?
Women aren't exactly throwing themselves at me.
Count from one to ten.
Aren't you too young to smoke?
I grew these carrots myself.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
He doesn't eat this, does he?
It is cheap, but on the other hand it is not good.
My car broke down on the way.
We must not give up.
Tom is a machinist.
All of these letters are addressed to you.
I don't like feeling helpless.
She's lost her car keys.
Do you think about Tom a lot?
Go away before they see you here.
Our marriage is over.
Whales are not fish. They are mammals.
Please tell me what this means.
How are you going to do that?
You should stay in the hospital for treatment.
Tom could stop this.
I have to go back to work.
The chances are that the bill will be rejected.
Why are you speaking in French?
I'm eating.
I watch television all day long.
Where are you sleeping tonight?
The mayor presented the prizes in person.
You cannot be serious.
You know what you must do.
Do you like fish?
I want to do something for Tom.
I like my job.
How did you kill the guards?
What are you trying to hide?
That plan is unacceptable.
It would take a long time to tell the whole story.
It looks like you had a tough day.
They all need attention.
They mistook my politeness for friendship.
Act your age.
I wish to be alone for a while.
I am leaving town for a few days.
Prices are double what they were two years ago.
You're my kid's teacher.
His play was a hit.
My wife did not attend the party and neither did I.
She and I are in the same class.
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
Tom eventually calmed down.
Who are you supposed to be?
Be prepared for the worst.
Horses are animals.
I can do it now.
I used to play alone when I was a child.
I'd better call you back.
I am not your enemy.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a teacher.
Isn't it a lovely morning?
You can do anything you want, depending on what floats your boat.
I can't be seen with you.
It is not my day.
She runs a charity.
Can you tell me what this is?
A lot of countries participated in the Olympic Games.
I often catch colds in the winter.
You're a funny guy.
I know nothing yet.
I think you know what I think.
I had a fantastic time at your party.
Draw two concentric circles of differing diameters.
I hear that even taxi drivers often get lost in Tokyo.
I never asked you to do that.
We need to make a slight detour.
I've been trying to get your attention.
My sister married him in spite of our objections.
I'll take a shortcut across the garden.
Why didn't you just tell the truth?
I'd like to get some sleep.
How long will this go on?
Don't believe anything they say.
I think Tom likes his job.
He wanted to meet you.
I'm in way over my head.
Give the money to my son.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
You're the one who quit.
I wish you happiness.
Red is out of fashion.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Stop poking me.
How long do you plan on staying here?
Anybody would be better than nobody.
I have to make another call.
I thought you were right.
We couldn't do that.
We didn't hear you come in.
I'm a hard worker.
He looked at the ship through his telescope.
You have to try again.
I found that fascinating.
You need to press the button.
Do you like looking in the mirror?
The school is farther away than the station.
The bus stopped in every village.
The storm blew down a tree.
She cannot be over thirty.
He kept staring at me.
That didn't help.
Do you have a camera?
You must pay attention to him.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
We elected him president.
Why are we helping Tom?
It's not legal to keep wild animals as pets.
He knows how to captivate his audience.
I am out of work.
They're lucky to be alive.
I ran as fast as I could.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Social networking sites are all the rage now.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
I know that Tom would enjoy that.
My grandmother passed away peacefully last night.
Do you have any cash?
Can you drive a stick shift?
Come quickly.
Do you want anything to eat?
I'll show you later.
Where were you on 9/11?
I didn't know who they were.
When did you visit your friends?
She went there last summer.
Even my mom knows.
Everybody's crying.
I just got married.
Do you think I could do that?
She likes no one and no one likes her.
I'm not at all interested in physics.
The man took my arm.
I have a job I have to do.
Tom also likes bananas.
Are you listening?
Almost everyone participated.
They were punished for their crimes.
Many foreigners come to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese.
Do you think that Tom would enjoy doing that with us?
Where've you been?
She wasn't friendly with him then.
Why did you call me?
We had a traditional church wedding.
I believed in myself.
He doesn't stand a chance.
I want proof.
He has a camera.
This is crazy.
She gave him mixed signals.
As far as I know, this is the only translation available.
Tom is a drummer.
I have to meet him.
I stayed home all day.
Who is your favorite actor?
He would often sit for hours without doing anything.
What a big supermarket!
I was very tired so I went to bed early.
What'll it be like?
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
You won't be fired.
What is the emergency?
She was laughed at by her friends.
Don't act like you know me.
Tom opened the door even though I told him not to.
Tom's sorry.
Have you ever seen a film this good?
Tom climbed down the ladder.
I know Tom will be supportive.
Go straight on down this street.
You're a terrible dancer.
He was able to pass the exam.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
OK, I think I got it.
I don't like it when you do that.
They were talking about you.
He canceled the appointment at the last moment.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
A quarterly growth of 1.2% means an annual growth rate of 4.8%.
I can't drive myself home.
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
Is anybody home?
Tom died with a knife in his back.
Why are you so clumsy?
I can't get away from work now.
What could possibly have gone wrong?
It's an ambitious plan.
I had never eaten any kind of Thai food, so I was pretty excited about going to a Thai restaurant with my grandmother.
I saw a koala for the first time.
He's raking it in.
Her sewing basket, dresser drawers and pantry shelves are all systematically arranged in apple-pie order.
She put down her thoughts on paper.
Let's be honest with each other.
I wrote a letter to my parents at home.
We'll be just fine.
I freaked out.
We don't have enough time.
Your questions were too direct.
I don't see how that would help.
You should take your car to Tom's Garage. He does a pretty good job.
Are we friends?
I would like to know her name.
She's well known as a singer.
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
I'm coming right away.
That's exactly what I thought.
Come and see me when you have time.
I don't believe half of what I've been told about you.
I did it like this.
What's it made from?
Tom filed a patent for his invention.
I have to buy a new scanner.
I had never seen that kind of fish until then.
I know you've been trying to help.
I work too much.
Don't worry. I'm a doctor.
We were born on the same day.
I thought I was going crazy.
Tom and Mary weren't religious at all.
Tom attempted to persuade Mary to go to church with him.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
Now that you are eighteen, you can get a driver's license.
Aren't you sleepy?
Here's a basket full of fruit.
I didn't see any children in the park.
You're famous.
Don't let him know the truth.
I'll have to go there tomorrow.
I'll come back for you.
It cost me 10 dollars.
He saved money for the trip.
You speak French, don't you?
Don't call me anymore.
I saw him playing baseball.
Children filled the room.
Tom will need a lot of help.
You're a traitor.
He thoughtfully gave me a helping hand.
Why don't you talk to us now?
I usually walk to school.
I need another drink.
I slept very well last night.
If I had eaten more for lunch, I wouldn't be hungry now.
That man is a famous cabaret performer.
Take a sip of this.
I thought we were happy.
I was broke.
He has only one servant to attend on him.
I know what's happening at home.
You promised me you'd look after Tom.
Nothing remained in the refrigerator.
English is spoken in a lot of countries.
They moved here three years ago.
I'm washing my hands because they're dirty.
Can I have some water, please?
Why did Tom call you?
It's snowing again.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
This answer may not necessarily be wrong.
All his friends backed his plan.
That amounts to the same thing.
You can't cancel the meeting.
Thank you so much.
Sit beside me.
Tom knew Mary was at work.
I could walk.
You should have gotten up earlier.
I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
There is no running water.
Could you possibly translate this for me?
Count up to thirty.
I read the book.
I went on reading.
Try to keep it down.
Perhaps he will come.
That's not fair.
I've just found out who you are.
Tom worked until 2:30.
Try not to be so tense.
Don't kid me!
Tell Tom I still have his umbrella.
I learned that a long time ago.
You won't stay, will you?
Don't despair.
It's like being a kid in a candy store.
I'll win using whatever means it takes.
Don't you have any will power?
This is a big problem.
I don't think I can help you.
I'm not young anymore.
Go away.
I don't believe anything those people say.
I haven't read today's newspaper yet.
I let my sister use my new computer.
How much is that going to cost me?
The conflict between blacks and whites in the city became worse.
I have to take medicine.
I'd like to know where you are.
I'd love to visit Boston.
We were captured.
Stay here.
I wanted red shoes.
You have to take a shower.
We need to find an effective method.
He lay on his back on the bed.
Tom really wants to be your friend.
I can't dance.
It's the dry season here.
I changed my address last month.
Here is the map.
I handled it.
Dad! Mom! I have some great news for you!
Go away. I don't want to see you.
The events unfolded just as she predicted.
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
She asserted that she was right.
I love you guys.
I'm responsible for this.
That's terrible advice.
Is Tom learning French?
He lived there all by himself.
I saw Tom naked.
The North won the Battle of Shiloh.
Sorry. The train was late.
He got his car washed at the filling station.
Really?
You are not a doctor.
Everybody loves a winner.
Every author suffers from writer's block from time to time.
What a wonderful gift!
The baby is sleeping.
We need to discuss this.
Don't be so impatient.
Tom is in his freshman year.
Did you find that helpful?
Tom thought Mary would be late.
You owe me a beer.
It's time you stopped watching television.
Tom is joking.
I hope you won't tell anyone you saw me leave this house.
I still don't write Chinese well.
Maybe I can show you.
He stayed in New York for three weeks.
I don't want to do your dirty work.
I'm a law student.
Did you read the article?
How did you handle the situation?
It's not going to end well.
The product of two negative numbers is positive.
He vowed to give up smoking.
How come you didn't call me last night?
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a race car driver.
I've had a lot of fun.
Did Tom call?
That's enough for today.
Our class is a small one.
Are you through with the paper?
I was naive.
You can go there in a boat.
I'm sure Tom will be home soon.
I couldn't tell you why.
We know very little about the cause of this disease.
Did you see anybody there?
Do you mind if I change the channel?
I had no idea you knew how to play mahjong.
I slept very well last night.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
If you want to become a good writer, you need to practice writing.
That's one question I can't answer.
She boards students.
I think both of them are right.
By the way, have you seen him lately?
Slow down.
How exactly am I supposed to do that?
Our team is likely to win the game.
I want to be here with you.
We took shelter under a tree.
I had dinner ready for you.
A cat has nine lives.
Don't drop that cup.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
I thought I gave you the key yesterday.
Your nose is running.
The unrest lasted three days.
Do you really want to know the truth?
How did your test go?
You can't just quit.
No one works there anymore.
Did you empty the dishwasher?
Hurry up! I don't have all day.
He handled the tool skillfully.
Your problems are nothing compared to mine.
Have you ever been to an opera?
The children went out to play.
You don't seem so smart.
He is going to stay with his uncle for the weekend.
It may rain tomorrow.
Sorry for being late.
That book is small.
You can't trust Tom.
He is now almost as tall as his father is.
Hang on tight!
He has absolute power.
Which do you like better, this or that?
He does this all the time.
I realized what was happening.
Save your long-winded explanations for someone else.
I saw you with a tall boy.
I'm glad to hear that your sister is out of danger after her operation.
I'm writing a book.
I think if I talked more often with a native speaker, my English skills would improve quickly.
The body converts extra calories into fat.
I just dropped in to say goodbye.
I have hardly any English books.
If you only had one more week to live, what would you spend your time doing?
I don't see that as a problem.
Have you eaten anywhere interesting lately?
This is the right answer.
He talks very cheerfully.
You've underestimated Tom.
I want them alive.
You don't have to hide your feelings.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
It's an interesting argument.
I'll do anything I can to help.
When did you learn how to swim?
Is it legal?
We are in part responsible for it.
If it rains, the game will be canceled.
They are all very hungry.
He denies having done it.
She is very popular among the boys.
We plan on staying a week.
I felt sorry for the boy.
This paper does not absorb ink.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
How's your kid doing?
There is milk in the refrigerator.
That girl over there is my sister.
May I know the reason why?
Who will pay?
I'm not the one who crashed the car.
He fell asleep immediately.
How long does it take to walk from here to the city hall?
I have no excuse.
I always believe you.
Do I need to go right now?
I have to open my shop.
Tom fell down into the ravine.
My stomach's full.
We value our customers.
It's not our fault.
You have only to touch the button.
Let me help.
We must finish our homework first.
You like her, don't you?
You're not looking at the whole picture.
She threatened him.
Did you watch TV yesterday?
I hear that Tom and Mary have eloped.
Love knows no limits.
That sounded like a gunshot.
Don't fret.
Be there tonight.
Take anything you want.
I got you a little something.
They want the best.
I'll have the same.
It was too small.
I'm all set.
She did her best to help him.
You said it yourself.
That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.
He never takes into account the fact that I am very busy.
Tom is a good cook.
Let me give you a lift as far as the station.
The other students laughed.
His daughter, as well as his son, was famous.
I am paid weekly.
I don't understand your question.
I just don't want to say the wrong thing.
Maybe you should quit drinking.
The officer inspired his men to be brave.
Tom was killed in the explosion.
You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in.
What would you do?
I have courage and a strong will.
Have you ever seen such a beautiful sunset?
Tom knows.
After a brief peace, war broke out again.
I want to go wherever you're going.
What are you up to?
I stayed at home instead of going out.
That child was left in the sun too long.
I am in Paris.
Why didn't you tell me you couldn't swim?
As soon as he saw a policeman, he ran away.
Let me help you put on your coat.
They didn't find the bomb.
Don't tell me what I can't do.
I have an announcement to make.
What's this green stuff?
I wish I could make up for lost time.
I prefer to not talk about it.
She took part in our project.
You can invite other people.
One must follow the rules.
Please be careful.
This is for my friend.
I really wish I could be there with you.
Where will we eat breakfast today?
They don't go well together.
I have some money.
I want a list of everyone in this class.
If it gets boring, I will go home.
I never oversleep.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
You don't need to do that.
I don't have any problems at all.
Can we turn the TV off?
I want to tell you a strange thing.
I loved that.
I rewrote it.
I agree with you to a certain extent.
This one's all yours.
Before I knew it, I couldn't see the birds.
My mother is busy cooking dinner.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
That won't make any difference.
Tom doesn't think it'll snow tomorrow.
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
My mother can't come.
I want to do that now.
I got this job with my teacher's help.
My watch gains five seconds a day.
Tom has begun to look for work.
You'll find the letter under these papers.
I hope you brought coffee.
Tom won the game.
I don't want to fight you.
Tom doesn't want anything to drink.
Tom has shoulder-length hair dyed red.
Hello, Tom. Good morning.
I've said I'm sorry.
I'm too tired to go out for a run.
He won the first prize at the chess tournament.
You sound like a broken record.
She forced him to eat spinach.
Just be glad you're OK.
Come into my arms.
Your plan sounds great.
I didn't tell anybody.
I'll take care of it as soon as I can.
Can I give you a bit of advice?
He was slain in battle.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
The couple spent a lot of money on furnishing their house.
Come to us.
I'd like to explain everything, but I don't think we have enough time.
She came home after dark.
I've got a cold.
I'll believe it when I see it.
He would sit for hours reading detective stories.
They smiled at one another.
Tom knows who stole your car.
He is likely to win the game.
Can you verify that?
Tom believes everything I say.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
I'll do whatever you want.
I can't give it to you.
Where's the nearest restaurant?
Why are all these people here?
We're very busy.
You can go anyplace you like.
I will study German.
What does this remind you of?
Who is their homeroom teacher?
Try to calm down.
I want to show you something.
Tom was caught speeding.
Aren't you a little young?
It's not my birthday.
Give me the wine.
I did what I was asked.
I just don't want to go with you.
Give it up.
I think you're nice.
He grows vegetables in his garden.
Come on, admit it.
Our school library has many books.
I can't promise Tom will talk to you.
I want to do this as much as you do.
Tom may not wait any longer.
Are you relaxed?
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
I had no choice.
Did you read it all?
He is over 80 kilos.
I went to the movies with my brother.
Is it an action movie?
It's a sign.
I did everything you asked.
You can't believe everything you hear.
Careless driving causes accidents.
Come immediately.
You're early.
Could we meet privately?
He lost face.
Most public places are simply not geared to people with disabilities.
I'm not here to hurt you.
It's awfully cold today.
Did I mention that?
I was on the spot when he had a heart attack.
Can you answer this question?
Tom did that not once, but twice.
He ruled his kingdom fairly.
Tom is the most boring person I know.
The girl and her parents were very sympathetic.
Put some clothes on.
Is Tom well?
It was the increase in population that caused the poverty.
I'm one of your employees.
Talk to my attorney.
She drives me crazy.
He told me about it in private.
He began to sing.
Has the movie started yet?
How long have you been divorced?
Everybody wants to sit beside her.
Tom is at work, isn't he?
I'm going to be sick.
You take my breath away.
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
There was a huge explosion.
The horse chafed at the bit put in its mouth.
There's something I still don't understand.
This just happened to me.
I don't know what I did wrong.
Take a rest.
Tom has a new girlfriend.
I want you to come work for me.
I have no one to leave my money to.
I went to the airport to meet my father.
I'll go to Boston to be with family.
There are several possible explanations.
That won't happen again.
I usually wake up at 6.
This place isn't so bad.
Have you considered therapy?
Is there something wrong with your car?
I think you're in danger.
I heard someone knocking.
Tom sent Mary a lot of letters.
You're very intelligent.
He looks just like his father.
Please hurry. I don't have all night.
Is that really a road we want to go down?
It's an extreme case.
Make a choice.
How are we going to pay for that?
We're powerful.
Nothing can stop me.
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
I had the same problem when I was your age.
There's a hair in my soup.
I regret saying that.
Things are not what they seem.
Did I say you could talk?
We kept them quiet.
Tom watches TV all the time.
This operation is simple.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
What makes you happy?
Let's go to a Japanese restaurant.
They're not criminals.
It is said that he knows the secret.
Your friends are waiting for you.
You should eat.
I feel kind of frustrated.
I'll never forgive you.
He was moved to tears when he heard the news.
I'm comfortable.
They're old.
I think we should do that today.
What did you get hit with?
This book's new.
I regret to say he's gone for good.
Thanks for the tickets.
She struggled to get up.
Tom is an air traffic controller.
Open your mouth wide.
He had his secretary type the report.
The problem disappeared as if by magic.
Please come again two weeks from today.
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
What are your true feelings?
Don't attack me.
Since you're tired, you should rest.
She parted from her friend in tears.
I'd like the bill, please.
Several American warships were sent to Panama.
I asked what he was going to do.
My parents won't let me have a dog.
A dachshund is a dog from Germany with a very long body and short legs.
I thought it might be you.
Whatever you do, don't run.
That dress looks stunning on you.
Are you meeting someone here?
You can't trust that guy.
Do you come here often?
The price of rice rose by more than three percent.
I want to know who you were with this afternoon.
He was ashamed of having done such a thing.
Maybe you got the date wrong.
They lie all the time.
You're forgetful.
He went home yesterday.
I didn't know who they were.
They had a duty.
You don't have to yell at me.
We did it!
I love myself.
I was a teacher for fifteen years.
You should look that word up.
I never thought it would be this bad.
It happens to all of us.
I just got a call from the hospital.
How did you come by this painting?
I wasn't listening to the radio.
A white dove is on the roof.
I'll kill the both of you.
I'm looking for you.
I'll transfer you to the right person.
How about going for a walk after lunch?
Do as you want.
I was the happiest man on earth.
I‘m ironing my handkerchiefs.
How much are you being paid to do this?
She interrupted him while he was speaking to my father.
Bring me today's paper, please.
America is ahead in space technology.
I don't think he is truthful.
Lake Towada is famous for its beauty.
I admit nothing.
I can't do more than that.
In the light of what you told us, I think we should revise our plan.
I've started going out with Tom.
I'm going to sleep.
I can't let you do that.
Don't let this chance slip by.
I'd like to have a word with you.
Don't be in such a hurry.
We're baffled.
You're all I've got.
A little rest would do us a lot of good.
I told you I hate that shirt.
Does that mean you'll have to stay?
I'm glad you see it that way.
How long will you stay here?
I'm feeling really sick.
I remember one poem in particular.
His mother came to pick him up.
Everything in the bathroom is tiled except the ceiling.
Who did this to you?
My glass is empty.
It isn't expensive.
I believe we can get that done.
Do you offer any day trips?
It was a sunny day.
We haven't come to a decision yet.
I'll read it.
If you're not with us then you're against us.
Tom says that he's too tired to study.
He goes to the library to read books.
She is a twin.
I'm glad I hired you.
I tried not to think about that.
The basket was filled with strawberries.
Have you seen Tom try to start a fire?
Are you expecting Tom?
That could be difficult.
This watch cost me ten thousand yen.
Tom thought it would be a good idea to leave early.
I don't see what you two are so happy about.
I spent the whole day cleaning my house.
I don't carry cash anymore.
He persuaded his wife not to divorce him.
How many friends do you have?
I have no food.
I'm not going to be able to do that.
I was quite lucky.
Promises are made to be broken.
Which is your target?
They swam.
I can tell you're angry.
Everyone is friendly to her.
I discovered too late that I left out the most important part of my speech.
The sky is becoming cloudy.
We'll pass.
I mean it.
What do you do in your free time?
I'll guide you.
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
He may come and see us tonight.
I don't know how you did it.
I am losing my patience with you.
This is very important to us.
I want to have a cup of coffee.
I can't tell you how much this means to me.
I remember that I gave him the key.
We should obey our parents.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Be careful!
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
That's an abuse of authority.
This is the most enjoyable thing I've ever done.
I am shorter than you.
I made several mistakes in the exam.
Sooner or later, I'll probably get bored.
It was time for lunch.
I don't think Tom lied to us.
You have to do it again.
Have you read this book yet?
Is everybody busy?
That's how he discovered the comet.
Turn on the TV.
This book should help you a lot.
A woman asked me for directions.
Can you get a day off?
Don't put the saddle on the wrong horse.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
I've been walking all day.
We're going down.
I just don't want to catch your cold.
I put some cookies on the table and the kids ate them right up.
That's what my mom keeps telling me.
I'm being sincere when I say that I love you.
I'll say it one more time.
I lied to my parents.
The answer was right in front of me.
I wanted to make new friends.
I have to learn many words and phrases by heart.
It's gotten better.
Give it to me.
Lay down on the couch.
She was wearing dark brown shoes.
Look at the picture at the top of the page.
Tom wished he could understand French better.
You can't just leave me here to die.
I worked in a restaurant.
We lost sight of the man in the crowd.
She is great at skiing.
He used me as a guinea pig.
She plans to stay at the Oriental Hotel.
This is a good show.
We'll miss Tom.
I tried calling, but they didn't answer.
Do it right away.
Don't read my journal.
He asked my mother.
I could fire you for that.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
There is no denying that she is very efficient.
I have no idea what'll happen.
Tom didn't want just any car. He wanted his grandfather's car.
No one will believe you.
There's no time to argue.
Why do you like Tom so much?
Tom still hasn't paid me.
Are you no longer in pain?
She opened the letter quickly.
You don't have to get up so early.
There was a large audience at yesterday's concert.
The moon is out.
I haven't been eating out much lately.
Because of the rain, we weren't able to play tennis outside.
Please don't do that anymore.
Is that your mother?
He stood with his back to the wall.
The cows were moving very slowly through the long green grass.
I'd love to go there one day.
The three gunshot victims are in critical condition.
I feel like getting some fresh air.
My wife is a good manager.
Don't touch the stove.
Tom said that you wanted to go with us.
I need your answer by the end of the day.
There are around three thousand mosques in Istanbul.
Both of them seem suspicious.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
What Tom told you wasn't true.
I am not well at all.
It took me several hours to translate it.
This shoe fits me well.
How do I get downtown?
The good die young is an old saying which may or may not be true.
My father sometimes goes abroad.
Would you mind coming with me?
It is hardly worth discussing.
Sometimes I get carried away.
Do you have a retirement plan?
Do you want to join them?
I want to apologize to you for calling you a jerk in front of your girlfriend.
You don't have to wait until the end.
Where do you think Tom is?
I thought you'd always wanted to see this movie.
They're looking for you.
I'll let you know the results as soon as I can.
Is he just a one-trick pony?
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
Next time it will be my turn to drive.
Don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
My work is not complete yet.
I can't sing as well as Mary did.
Take your hands out of your pockets.
He has gone to Britain.
Everything appears to be going well.
I'm not proud of it.
He hates his life.
He is no stranger to me.
Look, I've had a long day and I want to go to bed right now.
One of the answers is correct.
You should make good on your promises.
This is the house where that poet lived when he was a child.
He took what little money I had.
My heart began to beat fast.
Give me a minute.
Have you eaten? "Yes, I have."
I haven't eaten anything substantial in 48 hours.
I don't think that changes anything.
Can you do me a tiny favor?
He refused to pay.
She's a very nice girl.
The road was very bumpy.
Please show me the menu.
Tom's father is an alcoholic.
My vision is getting worse these days.
This table is missing a leg.
The old rules don't apply.
I think it's time for me to organize a party.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
I love all of you.
I got lucky.
I have a throbbing pain here.
The first attack missed the target.
I'm not now in a position to help you.
He's a very nice boy.
The dinner was very good.
The increase in juvenile delinquency is a serious problem.
Why are you being mean to me?
Why don't you talk to me now?
They want us to come in right away.
Tom died in prison.
Tom's answers were correct.
I wouldn't tell Tom about that if I were you.
You don't want to know.
They walked around.
Tom has friends in high places.
I like skiing.
She didn't pay back the money.
I finished the job yesterday.
She brought up two children.
I will take the one that is more expensive.
I liked your friends.
Tom offered Mary his beer.
I love this game.
Make me a better offer.
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
You're not allowed to leave this room.
The results were far from satisfactory.
Give it to me.
This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.
Tom told Mary not to wait for John.
I could not help but state my opinion.
I have to dress up.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
That's a very good sign.
He needs the money.
Is this wine from Argentina?
Tom's arrived.
Don't mess up my system.
We must decide.
I lied to my boyfriend about my age.
Do it again!
How did you get to know her?
You're very talented.
I wonder whether Tom is really serious.
They had a good hunt.
Stop. That tickles.
Someone has stolen my tennis racket.
That's all Tom said.
Wait for me here and don't go anywhere.
Both are great schools.
I only wish it wasn't so hot today.
You've tried.
I don't know what I'm doing.
You don't seem so busy.
Not all men are like that.
Tom is exactly the same age as you.
I want to stay in America for a few years.
I drink to relax.
Who do you live with?
I was very proud.
I doubt there's anyone following me.
It was raining so hard that we had to put off our departure.
Tom is ill at ease among strangers.
It is too hot.
The teacher taught them that the earth is round.
All are welcomed.
This is the boy who helped me.
Why don't they just come and get us?
It's easy to see the fireworks from over there.
You aren't as short as I am.
Are you hurt anywhere?
Tom and I are buddies.
You really should've told Tom not to come.
They don't belong in there.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't know Mary.
His debts amount to 100,000 yen.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
You look beautiful this evening.
How did you come to know one another?
There are many galaxies in the universe.
My mother is well off.
I had to act at once.
I'm sorry that I can't be who you want me to be.
He worked from morning till night.
She looked pleased with her new ring.
I don't know what you're interested in.
I'll see you around.
The bank was run by private citizens.
I have returned.
If you want to do good work, you should use the proper tools.
I have a lot of work to get through today.
This data is outdated.
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
I have around thirty of them.
One minute has sixty seconds.
We meant well.
Thank you for today.
You can't blame me.
We didn't want to get in your way.
I find swimming fun.
Christians view human nature as inherently sinful.
I'd like to study in China to improve the level of my Chinese.
Do you ever study in the library?
There was nothing I could do about it.
Tom slept on the park bench.
Would you like to travel abroad?
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
Why don't you take a picture?
Tom said he had plenty of friends in Boston.
They are probably all dead now.
What does this have to do with us?
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
Her house is across the river.
The rain made me late.
Are you playing games with me?
We'll discuss that later.
Let's not beat around the bush.
He betrayed you.
I need to write a book report.
Were you busy?
I'll be happy to work with you.
Never be this late again.
Do it delicately.
You seem really busy this morning.
We'll look into the case at once.
Why do you want this job?
I enjoyed talking with him.
You aren't really going to do that, are you?
I need to talk to you privately.
I will see to it that everything is ready in time.
I know I'm not a likable guy.
He was born and brought up in Tokyo.
I'm timid.
Will he come tomorrow?
You've put on weight, haven't you?
I can't share that information with you.
I'll pick you up in front of the hotel.
I think that Tom is still sleeping.
Look, I'm not interested.
I go for a walk every morning.
He does not have to do this.
You promised me you'd look after Tom.
You came at five.
Stop being so naive.
They're not home yet.
This museum is worth a visit.
Do you like it then?
I don't trust him any longer.
Say what you have to say.
Tom went inside.
You're not welcome here.
She was appointed chairperson.
No one came.
I'm as tall as Tom.
I don't have the option.
The police found no signs of foul play in the apartment.
You don't want to do anything rash.
I'm not talking to you, Tom.
I am going to America by plane.
I suppose I'd better be more careful the next time.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
You must go.
The dog is on the chair.
You must realize that I can't help you.
Don't tell me to go home.
I'm fat.
I never felt like I fit in.
He will come.
Do you know what happiness is?
I understand that a mistake has been made.
I don't have any close friends.
We have a lot of work to do.
I go to the dentist every second day.
You'll thank me for this someday.
He flew into a rage.
I will never see him.
I need to go to sleep.
Tom doesn't want to lose Mary.
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
Will you be hiring any part-time help?
Everyone is going.
I shouldn't have done that without your permission.
You'll have to ask someone else.
We didn't find it.
We need help.
Of course I remember you.
Tom said he wasn't ready to become a father.
I'll try that.
Thanks for your explanation.
Just do what I did.
Only girls' shoes are sold here.
The heavy fog made it impossible for us to see anything in front of us.
I can make the time to talk to you.
I tried to save you.
Tom is hiding behind the couch.
I went to bed a little earlier than usual.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
I am afraid to go.
They are my friends.
Tom will explain it to you.
I hate that word.
Do you really not know?
Could you draw a map for me?
I got lucky.
She advised him to come back at once.
I have plenty of time.
He is likely to come.
I think this is a very good plan.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
It's a scalp disease.
She sued him.
You need to do this.
Tom's helping.
Do you live in the city?
How many people died?
I would love to try that out.
Are we going to do that?
Are you sure you can do this?
You'd better tell him the truth.
I'm not going to let my children do that.
How did you enjoy the movie?
I don't believe I'm even standing here.
Have you ever been kissed?
They didn't want me to examine it.
She didn't show up.
He's fresh out of college.
I need to ask you a favor.
What denominations would you like that in?
My friend only eats organic food.
Where can I find an outlet for all my anger?
Hang on tight.
He lost sight of the bird.
He will never live up to his parent's expectations.
I'm sorry for being late.
I'm not as rich as I was.
They dealt with the prisoners kindly.
When is Tom's birthday?
She looked as if she had seen a ghost.
When are you off?
You seem depressed.
Tom was obviously horrified.
Thanks for your hard work.
The new museum is worth visiting.
Don't look so shocked.
How much is that?
I think you're funny.
How fast does this thing go?
I can rip you apart with my bare hands.
Tom challenged Mary to a game of chess.
How can you be so sure?
The air feels somewhat cold this morning.
I wonder why so many of these nails are bent.
I slept in front of the TV.
They were afraid of being overheard.
You don't need to know that.
What kind of man was he?
Do you still remember how to do it?
What did you buy for me?
My glasses are on my nightstand.
Let me have another look.
You were beginning to worry me.
My sister became a college student.
I'm looking forward to the next time.
How did you get them?
You must quit drinking.
I realized I wasn't ready.
We intend to do better next year.
This one's still alive.
You're not very tidy.
He stopped smoking last year.
She is very busy.
I just wanted to let you know.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
It's my fault that the cake was burned. I was talking on the phone and didn't notice the time.
All of you look healthy.
It's been more than a month.
Who's the man sitting at the other end of the table?
If you turn on me like that, I won't say another word.
I'll be with you in just a second.
I'll tell you my story.
I'm surprised.
Why didn't you call me last night?
I love you all.
He gave me a smile of recognition.
That isn't what I'm talking about.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.
She is a kind girl.
That's what I told him.
I count on your help.
Get in the car now.
Tom won't be long.
You can't be sure of that.
I would never make fun of you.
I want him to leave.
Tom plays the piano every day.
The postman was bitten by that dog.
Who're you calling now?
I'm so thirsty.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I hope that you're not afraid.
Everything is expensive here.
We have known each other for years.
I thought he had died.
The cat arched its back.
Stop avoiding the question.
I arrived ahead of the others.
She's being nice to me.
I got married three years ago.
This paper is white.
Do you have a table on the patio?
He regrets having wasted his time.
I don't have long.
Don't stand near me.
They're students.
You're lucky to have a job.
I'm not the boss.
God bless you!
I'm a cameraman.
I know I can't take Tom's place.
She must be very happy.
It is true that she teaches French.
Would you please shut the window?
They're speaking French.
Tom didn't have time to watch TV yesterday.
Why don't you go talk to him?
It changed nothing.
You're hiding something.
I'm proud of my dad.
Well, you've convinced me.
They were in a hurry to get home.
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
It's almost six.
Tom isn't a friend of mine.
You should know it.
You gave me only fifty cents.
I rang the bell.
Someone is hiding in the corner.
I've lost the key to my room.
They left him for dead.
English is spoken in Singapore.
My car was stolen last night.
I didn't get enough sleep.
He lives paycheck to paycheck.
Face facts!
You were removed from the list.
That's easier said than done.
Come with me now.
You don't have to go unless you want to.
Are you sure about that?
That adds a new dimension to our problem.
I'll turn the power on.
I'll let you do that.
He bit his lip.
He was involved in a murder case.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
Washing your hands regularly is a good way to prevent catching some diseases.
I had no doubts.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
Tom said he was very happy.
That's a copy.
We voted for the candidate.
Can I sit down?
You must've thought I was an idiot.
I suppose you know all about it.
Mary is not poor. On the contrary, she is quite rich.
Could you please not smoke in this room?
I just gave up.
I'm delighted to be here.
I hope you're not going to disappoint me.
I eat with my hands.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I really didn't have time.
We played chess.
We all know you're smart.
I knew things about Tom that even his parents didn't know.
They established a Japanese language class for the refugees.
He doesn't have his medication.
I have often heard it said that honesty is the best policy.
He had a kind word and a pleasant smile for everyone.
She beat him to death.
Tom didn't come, did he?
Almost no one believed him.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
We've already tried.
Can you write a letter in English?
Compare your translation with the one on the blackboard.
I want my money back now.
What if they don't like me?
What did you talk about?
Drinking was his ruin.
Do you have a twin brother?
People like Tom lie all the time.
I understand your frustration.
I'm going to take the dog to the vet.
I was trying to kill time.
I don't feel like celebrating.
How dare you tell me what I should or shouldn't do!
These books and clothes are all yours.
I looked around, but saw nobody.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be able to finish the report by 2:30.
No one was in the park.
Have a safe trip.
Tom isn't lucky, but Mary is.
I don't have a bicycle.
I'm glad I have a friend like you to confide in.
This seems stupid.
You'll be in trouble.
I've lost it.
Everything is working out just as Tom predicted.
I have three times as many books as Tom does.
She is on a diet.
I have a truck.
I have no time to watch TV.
I could have you arrested.
The dog scared the cat.
I don't mind a bit.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
Tom can remember the chords to the song, but can't remember all the lyrics.
Don't be late for school.
Tom forgot to tell Mary that John had called.
It would never have occurred to me to say anything like that.
He goes running every morning.
You must've thought I was an idiot.
I'm glad you're coming.
He spends all his time extolling her virtues.
I knew we shouldn't have done this.
I don't feel like celebrating.
I wonder what I should make for dinner.
You are too young to travel alone.
I want my money back and I want it back now.
The rocket blew up a few seconds after launch.
You are so stupid.
I'm about the same height as Tom.
That's our house.
I finally found a use for this old thing.
It's beautiful.
He looked surprised.
I need more gold.
Who wouldn't want to live here?
I need to know what I've missed.
The hour-long concert at the Kennedy Center was broadcast live on TV last night.
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
You should talk to Tom.
How long have you had this car?
I love you the way you are.
Tom isn't very ambitious.
Tom is falling asleep.
I did not know this.
Some voters waited hours to vote.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Do you need a spoon?
The policy of the government was criticized by the opposition party.
They tried to discourage him from going.
I thought you'd wear something like that.
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one.
I'm satisfied with everything.
Tom is older than me.
My mother was an alcoholic.
How do I get to the beach?
I'm very tired today.
You're very clever.
He has more books than he can ever read.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
Hurry up, girls.
I don't live here anymore.
I don't want cereal.
Tom seems unable to do that.
This is the longest novel that I have ever read.
I'm ashamed to ask you such a silly question.
Hey, where are you?
Don't buy that.
You came too late.
She bears an uncanny resemblance to Marilyn Monroe.
I feel sad when I think about all the people who die in wars.
Who is sitting at the other end of the table?
She disappeared in the dark.
Her son is a mama's boy. He has to be with her all the time.
I feel like I know you already.
Tom fell asleep while he was driving and caused an accident.
I didn't sign up for this.
Tomorrow is a holiday.
I left my umbrella in the cab.
You're invited.
My girlfriend is crying.
I told you it wouldn't work, didn't I?
That's why I'm busy.
Don't forget to turn off the gas before going out.
What kind of yogurt do you like best?
I thank you.
How does one become rich?
Water and oil are both liquids.
I'm going to give Tom a bath.
Look on both sides of the shield.
Since he has ambitions, he works hard.
Obviously, he is lying.
Nothing changes.
Something bit me.
There's a party tonight.
I suggest you do that in October.
I'm feeling pretty confident.
Did we hit something?
This book is too difficult for you to read.
A number of countries have strict laws against drugs.
We reached the station on time.
Her son's death broke Mary's heart.
He said he was hungry, and then he added that he was also thirsty.
You have no right to say that.
I don't believe this is happening.
Tom told me that Mary was good at playing the piano, but I didn't really believe him until I heard her play.
You said that half an hour ago.
Have you checked the suggestions box today?
I don't think anybody can help me now.
He was punished for his crimes.
His knowledge of geography is insufficient.
Have you turned off the gas yet?
He is so heartless.
How are complaints handled?
I work hard in the garden.
I'll call the chef.
He won the race again.
The country declared war against its neighbor.
I want to get as far away from here as I can.
I'm resilient.
I often ignore Tom's advice.
What do you think they'll do?
You drive a hard bargain.
You can sit down if you want.
I think you know that's not true.
The committee consists of four members.
She died on a cold night in December.
I didn't know how to do it, but I was willing to give it a try.
Can I help you find something?
He seldom reads an editorial and is not a book worm.
I'd rather not.
Please answer the phone.
Have you told your mom?
Did anybody see what happened?
Tom was wearing his pajamas when he opened the door.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
Tell me how to spell your name.
Generally speaking, history repeats itself.
Tom knew there was a problem.
I am delighted to be here.
How did you accomplish all this?
A rat ran across the road.
They are in the teachers' room.
Tom went home at 6:30.
Let me do this.
You're always wearing the same clothes.
I don't know his name.
God has a plan for you.
Do you know where they are?
I'm not married, either.
You can't eat chicken? How do you know if you never try it?
Why are you studying?
I like coffee much more than tea.
You've been infected.
Why would they do that?
I won't pay for that.
You're pathetic.
This is a surprise.
Keep Tom safe.
I should be there.
Stop me if you can.
It's getting light. Morning is coming.
I didn't actually want to go to college.
I'll see him next Friday.
It's your turn to answer the question.
She graduated with honors.
Tom doesn't usually play backgammon.
We agreed we'd give it a shot.
How old were you when your father was killed?
Didn't I lend you some money yesterday?
He's an undergrad.
You seem to know a lot about me.
I'm going to see Tom.
I'd rather do this by myself.
It's the ultimate test.
My brother's in Australia now.
I only found out a couple days ago.
I know what your name is.
Do I annoy you?
Everyone is proud of you.
You're psychic.
She kept crying all the time.
Tom had forgotten how beautiful Mary was.
She's an intelligent young woman.
Do I annoy you?
Do you think I'm pretty?
We received a warm welcome.
You're not very organized, are you?
No one was fired.
I like this model.
I'll take you to the hospital.
Does your mom know?
Don't you think this suits me?
He drinks his coffee black every time.
I have no opinion on that matter.
The cost of living has gone down.
I wish I could see you.
Tom made a costly mistake.
My name is Tom. What's yours?
That is what this is about.
Is this a date?
This is my fate.
I've been promoted.
Tom wants you to buy him a ticket, too.
Does Tom have a girlfriend?
I guess you will be very busy tonight.
We're friends.
Isn't he a bit young?
Can you imagine what life would be like without television?
Tom can't use this.
I know Tom is still busy.
My first impression of him proved to be correct.
Thank you for everything you have done for me.
It's being arranged.
I thought I had a month to finish this.
Astronomy is by no means a new science.
Look out for rock slides.
I know you recently retired.
She gave me a nice pair of shoes.
We like Tom.
Would you please stop singing?
She took him to the store.
It's my book.
There is a rumor that the radicals are plotting against the government.
We're not the only ones doing it.
The town has changed a great deal since then.
I had things to take care of.
I let him sleep at my house for the night.
Do you miss it?
She stopped talking.
I don't understand what's happening to me.
Tom doesn't want us to go.
I'm not a beggar.
He adapted himself to his new life.
I guess that wouldn't mean much to you.
What are you cooking today?
British and Japanese cars have steering wheels on the right side.
Would you please tell this gentleman who I am?
She got him into trouble.
I didn't steal it. You can check my pockets.
I didn't want you to get involved.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
I guess this wasn't easy for you.
They sank ten enemy ships.
Just sign this.
How awful!
Some people look down on others because they have less money.
I've started learning French.
I'm sick of this hot weather.
She comes from California.
Tom couldn't make a living as a musician.
They're staring at you.
I advised him to come back at once.
I can't stop writing.
The cap is too small for me.
I need a concise explanation.
He likes collecting old coins.
In those days, I made it a point to take a walk before breakfast.
I am a good boy.
Air is to man what water is to fish.
I think Tom is sick.
I can speak Chinese.
I've been waiting for hours.
There is no shame in being poor.
My brother has been sick since yesterday.
I thought you had it all figured out.
The company has unofficially decided to employ me.
He stared at the steep slope.
Would you like a newspaper or magazine?
We hope to reach the summit before it gets dark.
What would you like to eat?
I don't think I can keep that promise.
Maybe it's better this way.
I hope you're not offended.
Tom hid behind a tree.
I'm looking for my key.
I can't agree with you.
We're all prisoners.
Tom didn't believe a word of what Mary said.
Tom could go to prison.
Let him go.
The mandate of the president lasted five years.
Does he want to look at it?
The mayor granted our request.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
How much is it?
Please lend me your dictionary.
I gave him my address.
I need to take a shower.
It's no concern of mine.
She is more an acquaintance than a friend.
The road was obstructed by fallen trees.
Stay in bed.
Where do we start?
I don't think Tom is listening.
He is a good speaker of English.
What's for dinner tonight?
I bet you can't guess where I was last night!
Tom speaks French better than you do.
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker no matter how much I try.
I was too astonished to speak.
We're expecting a good harvest this year.
He was a Roman Catholic.
Tom sent a text message to Mary.
They've bet the farm on it.
Have a taste.
I'm running Linux on my laptop.
I think we can avoid that.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
I'm too old for this.
I know nothing but this.
She came into the room.
How is it that you know so much about Japanese history?
Nobody called Tom.
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang.
Stop sucking up to the teacher.
It's what we always planned.
We know him.
None of my friends speak French.
That's exactly what I want to hear.
I can't speak French at all.
It makes me so happy.
I went to the park this morning.
You used to love swimming.
I called him Tom.
Whenever I try to get near her, she pushes me away.
Is that weird?
Do you want to go out tonight?
It's been ten years since we last met.
They're all hungry.
If you're tired, rest.
Can you hurry up?
They got the short end of the stick.
I think it's time for me to get a new pair of glasses.
They're too fat.
Moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.
I'll call you later today.
A parrot can mimic a person's voice.
Stop playing hard to get.
Can't we start again?
This guy is a crook.
Tom gets angry when he doesn't get his own way.
I'll stick around.
Why don't you sing something for me?
I don't want you to leave.
We're trapped!
What is this fish called in English?
I'm going to stay with my uncle in Kyoto.
I don't know much more than that.
What do you need to know?
His shoes are brown.
She takes care of my children.
Do you recognize that man?
That's a lot of money.
Am I cleared for duty?
She's looking the other way.
We're losing.
I saw you yesterday.
We can save a little time if we do what Tom suggests.
Which cup is yours?
Give me half.
You seem distracted today.
I had a weird dream last night.
Does this medicine work quickly?
Tom knew that Mary was dead.
Everybody desires happiness.
We saw nothing strange.
I am wondering if you would like to go and see Kabuki with me while staying in Japan.
Are you an idiot?
People were watching.
Please close the door behind you.
How would you analyze the situation?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
You're always saying that.
I used to go swimming in the sea when I was a child.
Things don't always turn out the way we plan.
It was an extraordinary year.
We've already wasted enough time.
Tom is shouting at Mary.
I'd very much like to hear your opinion.
I wonder if Tom is mistaken.
We agreed among ourselves.
Is he really the man you're looking for?
I suggest you go west.
I don't agree with you on this point.
Have you been playing basketball all afternoon?
Why did you come here today?
You don't seem so busy.
She gave him a massage.
I've finished reading that book.
Take your time when you eat meals.
That is the girl whose father is a doctor.
My mother does not always get up early.
Why were you there?
We're not proud of it.
I should've known better.
I was afraid that you'd say that.
They fell.
The storm prevented us from going out.
The robber aimed his gun at the clerk.
You might not want to mention that.
I'm not leaving you, Tom.
I didn't read it all.
What's in the bag?
Why don't you take your jacket off?
What year were you born?
He touched me.
I enjoyed this book.
Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
The door swung open and Tom walked into the room.
I don't regret what happened last night.
I'm probably just being paranoid.
She is quiet.
Were you excited?
Tom spent the night alone.
Judging from his expression, he is in a bad mood.
I just really need some time alone.
It's a common mistake.
She isn't old enough to get a driving license.
Let them take care of themselves.
When does it open?
It was very painful.
Nobody cares how much the dinner is going to cost.
Hey, how do you get this thing open?
You have to trust me.
His story was published in a magazine.
I wish you had told me the truth.
She gave me a shirt.
Our work never ends.
Don't talk to anyone.
I guessed right.
He would often go fishing.
My father quit drinking.
What kind of fool do you think I am?
I'm going to be very honest with you.
We all have different abilities.
We ate together.
The result remains to be seen.
Is it love?
I was not studying then.
Will you go with us?
I cannot do without this book.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
She beat him to death.
Tom is in there alone.
I appreciate your restraint.
This won't be the last time.
I like what I see.
They'll all be here tonight.
I'm going to Australia.
He often paints landscapes.
He has a big mouth.
I agree with you completely.
She mistook my brother for me.
It's not fair at all.
According to my accountant, this isn't a good time to invest in the stock market.
What's so strange about that?
I cannot feel at home in such a hotel.
I wash my face every morning.
Why don't we take him a bottle of wine?
Is Tom still interested?
I'll come again some other time.
Did you tell Tom?
I need to travel.
Did I win something?
I don't like loose ends.
Do you know how to ride a horse?
This sentence has five words.
He never saw his father again.
You must concentrate your attention on what you are doing.
Take whichever you want.
What are you going to have?
He is much older than he looks.
I suggest we don't even try.
Seal the doors.
The number of people suffering from heart disease has increased.
By the way, have you heard from her since then?
I know you feel lonely.
Who told you to talk to me?
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
Are you thinking about something in particular?
He would not go out.
Fighting won't settle anything.
I didn't see the fire hydrant.
Don't make me blush.
I will tell him about it when he comes next time.
How do you intend to do it?
There's really nothing more we can do.
Tom has frostbite.
Is that your cat?
Tom won't visit Boston.
Every minute counts.
I'd like to rent a car.
Tom forgot to bring his lunch today.
Where did you get your hair done?
I think it's time for me to go.
He searched his pockets for the key.
This is your fate.
Good eating habits are essential.
Zip up your coat.
Look who's here.
Where will you have lunch today?
I want to be heard.
He is an acrobat.
I began to sweat.
Is your mom home?
Did you enjoy yourself at the party last night?
Go play in traffic.
I'm sick and tired of reading.
It's not really necessary.
Have you ever been there?
I would like to visit you.
I have a reservation.
I went swimming after I woke up.
I'm ticklish.
Hand in the three sheets of paper together.
Do you have enough information to go on?
I'm wasted.
Tom will be very successful someday.
He asked me if I knew her telephone number.
She asked him why he was crying.
Have confidence in yourself.
What did you drink last night?
Tom is a really weird person.
We need to cancel the meeting.
She translated that word for word.
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
When did you come back from Germany?
Why don't you run for president?
The amount of time you spend practicing the trumpet is up to you.
I have a surprise for you guys.
You have my sympathies.
Since I walked very fast, I was in time for the last train.
I've already read today's paper.
All of my children were born in Boston.
Why do I have to do that?
Could I borrow your car?
Tom is Mary's French teacher.
This is an unusual situation.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
I'll call for you at eight tomorrow morning.
Tom scrubbed his feet.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
I regret becoming a teacher.
She didn't want him to go overseas.
What time does your plane leave?
I must go to work early today.
If you have something to say, just say it.
I don't want to have children. Is that abnormal?
Eat whatever you like.
This ring is a magic item that gives great power to its user.
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
It was so good.
You're never at home.
They donated money to the Red Cross.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
I think Tom would tell the truth.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I'd like to see you before I leave for Europe.
It's no good making the same old products year after year.
She called out to us for help.
Tom can be very charming.
You can't separate language from culture.
I like that kind of stuff.
We have enough water.
I've been to almost every state.
We know where Tom is.
The buying and selling of peoples' personal information is becoming a big issue.
You're not the only Canadian here.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Please tell me what this means.
Who are you supposed to be?
Close the box.
I woke up at 6:30.
He prefers plain, simple people, for he is plain and simple himself.
What country is Boston in?
I think I see the problem.
It is bold of you to say such a thing.
I think that you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life.
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
Even though she was busy, she came to see me.
What did you learn?
I must go.
It's a privilege, not a right.
We'll always be friends.
I made a lot of mistakes back then.
I could scarcely believe it.
I want a person who can speak French.
He walked all the way home.
I'd like to get the meeting started.
They reached their goal.
I started that.
I don't feel well today.
He can't sing.
They fell into each other's arms.
Be still.
I'll follow you wherever you go.
I feel like an impostor.
That was our biggest problem.
Civilization is the limitless multiplication of unnecessary necessities.
This isn't funny.
That's enough.
I don't blame them for this.
Neither motorcyclist was wearing a helmet.
This is a free ticket.
At least we're still in one piece.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
You're articulate.
I cried all night long.
Answer at once when spoken to.
It was an interesting debate.
I thought your parents liked me.
Let's do something different.
She lost her way.
Almost all the students like English.
There was nothing there.
I'll be there right away.
I am taking a bath now.
I will choose one.
Gradually the interest rate will increase.
I had to work.
Can't you see I'm busy?
You always were good at math.
She did her best to rescue him.
May I have the check, please?
Can you explain what PKO stands for?
This was really unfair.
What did you try to do?
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
Am I supposed to answer that question now?
It's a lot of fun to be with you.
Tom hit a home run.
How's your wife?
Lower your voice.
I accept your conditions.
I threw a ball to my dog and he caught it in his mouth.
The neighbor asked us to turn the music down.
I usually go to school by bus.
The plane left after a three-hour delay.
Foreign workers make up 30% of his company.
Tom certainly didn't expect to win.
You're not listening!
I was trying to talk to you.
You are my father.
Generally speaking, Americans like coffee.
Tom shouldn't have left.
You're too slow.
They grow oranges in California.
Both Tom and Mary are thirsty.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
You're always criticizing me!
I don't think I'd like you as a friend.
I've got company.
I was moved to tears by her speech.
I can't trust you anymore.
You can borrow a copy from any public library.
Bite your tongue.
I like rock music.
You're the only person I know who can play the French horn.
Can you answer this riddle?
I love movies.
I think I can solve this problem by myself.
He accepted the job.
He painted a dog.
I won't run away like a coward.
I thought that would interest you.
We left early in the morning.
Didn't that seem odd to you?
You could've been hurt.
I want to be pampered.
You deserve more than that.
I brushed my hair.
As long as we live, we have to work.
Tom says he doesn't have any regrets.
I never thought I'd be this busy.
That's it for today.
She didn't know what to say to him.
I was there the other day.
I visited my grandmother's house.
They bought a home with a pool.
The house was full of colorful art objects.
Rather than doing any good, the rain did a great deal of harm to the crop.
In these two or three years, he acquired a large amount of wealth.
We need to repaint the barn.
That's the last thing I remember.
We're not cops.
Take my word for it.
They've all moved away.
He came downstairs.
Do you want to come over tonight?
I have known Tom since I was a little boy.
I don't want to be treated special.
Tom is usually much busier than Mary.
He spoke about peace.
We'll stop them.
You're the teacher.
Let's try it with this one.
Trust no one.
Once upon a time, there lived a cruel king.
Get into your car.
What's your favorite number?
Can I borrow it for about two weeks?
You have a point there.
We've already met.
I need to keep my eyes open.
Don't repeat that.
I just found an old diary.
I don't approve of your going out with him.
You need to find your own way.
I know you don't know how to speak French.
The man was given a life sentence.
I am glad to help you.
He has my fate in his hands.
We're only friends.
I will go even if it rains tomorrow.
Is there a gas station around here?
I'm interested in your work.
He is well spoken of by everybody.
Tom said he was afraid.
He became sick and they laid him on a bench.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
I'm sorry, I don't buzz in people I don't know.
That's kind of deep.
We need you back.
They sat in a circle.
That's not really the point.
Have some coffee.
They have company.
My hands are stained with paint.
Would you like to have dinner at my place tonight?
The two brothers have died.
Wet clothes cling to the body.
How long would you like to stay?
She lay awake for hours thinking about him.
Don't forget that she's a woman.
We're all at risk.
Tom could've killed you if he'd wanted to.
The rules are about to change.
The result was far from being satisfactory.
Let's not do the work.
I just want to help.
Please continue until I tell you to stop.
It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I bought it anyway.
What sort of father do you think you'll be?
He stopped the car.
There's something I have to tell you.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
They deserved it.
I was home-schooled.
He didn't look happy.
I don't take vacations very often.
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
He hung a lamp from the ceiling.
It's a very challenging racetrack.
We took a cab.
Detroit is famous for its car industry.
We know the work is dangerous.
We already know each other.
I can't believe I'm not getting fired.
I think we're going to need it all.
She asked him some questions, but he refused to answer.
Can you pass me the salt?
I'd be angry, too.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
How long do we have?
I don't want my mother to worry.
Atoms are in everything.
Did you speak at all?
The phone rang while I was taking a shower.
You could have been happy.
There are a lot of bridges in this city.
I was quite shocked by this.
I wish I knew what it was.
I hate it here.
He is supposed to be at home today.
You handled that situation quite well.
They couldn't help us.
Did you think I was Canadian?
There's a lot of wind this morning, isn't there?
Tom seems to be in love.
I see nothing wrong with this.
Have you ever been arrested?
The stores are closed on Sunday.
Everybody cheered.
See things as they are.
I am unable to agree on that point.
I'm scared to death.
I don't know if we want to do that.
I read your report.
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
I received a warm welcome.
He gave in to the temptation.
We could sing together.
Men are all the same.
You are not a child any more.
Shall I ask her to send the book to us?
More tractors meant fewer horses and mules.
They were afraid of you.
Please close the door.
Why are you holding my hands?
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?
I was at that meeting.
Have you ever been kissed?
Every even number is the sum of two primes.
She has known him for a long time.
Don't ask questions that you don't want to know the answer to.
None of us are cowards.
I am almost ready.
How is this possible?
We may as well start at once.
Tom allowed me to go.
Tom said he won three hundred dollars.
The prince fell in love with a woodcutter's daughter.
He must love you.
Is that a new jacket?
They've changed a lot.
I'll need that.
I know that you lied to me the other day.
I'm rarely this angry.
We all got distracted.
Lay it on the table.
No one encouraged her.
I can't wait to go on a vacation.
We can't win.
I am of the opinion that she is right.
It really was hard.
He has a maid.
I'm trying to find the person who owns this guitar.
I made a deal.
You have a secret admirer.
I'll be absent from home in the afternoon.
I think that she's honest.
They were all dressed in uniforms.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
Do you want any?
I will wait here until he comes back.
He thought up an excuse.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I'm not the only one who can do this.
He asked a question about it.
We want candy.
We're still shopping around.
I don't see what you two are so happy about.
I've seen it a million times.
This is new.
What'll I find in the box?
That's lame.
I want to see you laugh.
I am hanging up my shirts.
How many times do I have to say it?
How stupid of me!
Tom will be absent today because he has a cold.
I seldom do that alone.
I just ignore Tom.
I'm yours.
Keep the child away from the pond.
Are you sure this is the right way to do it?
She made me a cake.
I need a haircut.
Tom will die in prison.
Everyone was killed.
No sinner is ever saved after the first twenty minutes of a sermon.
It's an easy victory.
I didn't even know you spoke French.
He slept an hour.
I'll help you as much as possible.
I'm wealthy.
I give you enough money every month to pay all your bills.
I know you're thinking about me.
I was caught in the rush hour.
He hung up.
You had plenty of opportunity.
This policy is sure to go a long way towards stimulating business.
They're awesome.
No one saw anything.
Do you smoke cigars?
He paid his loan back to the bank.
I was fortunate to make his acquaintance.
He drives very fast.
You have a choice to make.
Your answer is right.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
I must go.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
Please send me another copy.
I think we need to go back to Boston.
They are negotiating to reach a satisfactory compromise.
You were the one who gave me that tip.
You need to lie down.
Did you pass your exams?
Two sheep were killed by a wolf.
Did Tom find it?
Take a little nap on the couch.
There were many things that needed to be done before we could leave.
I get the idea.
I really have to get this done today.
May I take a picture of you?
What exactly happened?
He stood close to her and tried to protect her from the typhoon.
I held the conch to my ear and heard the ocean inside.
I know she puts up with a lot from me.
I'm uninsured.
She had her hat blown off by the wind.
Tom is walking his dog.
Have you already read this book?
Do you think he will be elected president again?
I don't really understand how that works.
What department do you work for?
There's nothing more to say.
Tom used to play soccer.
Music is a gift from God.
The source of the fire is unknown.
Tom knocked Mary down.
I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
There are a lot of beautiful songs on these records.
Honesty is very important.
That's a lovely necklace.
Everyone was fighting.
My watch keeps good time.
Her car might be more pleasant to drive, but it also costs her more for maintenance.
The noise doesn't bother us.
Are you out of your mind?
Tom was really crazy.
Do you have enough time to do that?
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
He was absent from school because he was sick.
Tom has a bad cold.
Do you ever sleep?
I didn't even know that you had one.
What time is it?
When did you notice that?
Tom is famous, isn't he?
Let's not do that anymore.
Be very careful.
What did you do to it?
We're shaken.
He has a car that I gave him.
Your plan is bound to fail.
The telephone rang.
A man who smacks his wife around is contemptible.
We have a lot to learn from each other.
The airplane landed on my father's farm.
She explained to him why she didn't like his parents.
I know a lot of good restaurants.
He raised his arm.
A cold spell gripped Europe.
If you are ever in Japan, come and see me.
We've only got three more days.
I don't believe it happened that way.
I live in Kazakhstan.
They waved flags to welcome the princess.
Tom's diet resulted in weight loss.
I'm glad to see you here.
Figure it out yourself.
I advised him to keep the secret.
What's the air temperature today?
I am calling to make an appointment with you.
Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood.
Tom is knocking on the door.
I wasn't hired.
I'm glad that they fixed the heating system, but now it's too hot.
I enjoy working.
She had nothing to do yesterday.
Don't ask questions that you don't want to know the answer to.
Did you hear it too?
Be friendly.
I figured that you weren't coming.
Why are you interested?
What're you all dressed up for?
She was advised by him not to go.
I don't think I was followed.
Hey, your dog just bit me.
They sweated.
Get out of my bed.
My mother visits the dentist's every other day to get her teeth fixed.
Tom is on this ship.
How are you two doing?
Without Tom's advice, Mary would have failed.
That noise is almost driving me mad.
Turn off the lights.
I didn't think it was real.
What's behind that door?
The light is better over here.
I think you're funny.
These empty boxes take up too much space.
Delicious refreshments were served.
How do you feel about Tom now?
I don't make deals with people like you.
His absence gave birth to all sorts of rumors.
Tom gave away everything he owned.
May I visit you tomorrow?
They're lucky to be alive.
You're alone, aren't you?
Are you enjoying the play?
Do you know anyone who needs a job?
Your mother is in critical condition.
Tom is going to be very pleased.
How does this remote work?
Prices dropped suddenly.
He fixed the broken table.
That remains a possibility.
Tom left his kids at home.
Unlock the door.
Tom picked up a book, opened it, and started reading it.
My school has a band.
You're no fun.
He isn't able to buy a car.
Please turn off the light so that I can sleep.
You're going to love our food.
This trip was your idea.
You want to leave here, don't you?
Last night there was a fire near here, and I couldn't sleep.
I'm sure that I can do that.
Go and open the door.
I was impolite.
She advised him to stay in bed for two more days.
I should have left earlier.
Has it occurred to you that you might be the one with the problem?
Who's Tom afraid of?
You go first.
The rich have many friends.
Can you still remember where we first met?
Did you have a good time yesterday?
How much does this umbrella cost?
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
I have faith in you.
You're going to have to do better to convince me of that.
I gave up smoking a year ago.
I'm not sure if it's a compliment or an insult.
She seemed disappointed at the result.
He was my best friend.
Where did you get all this from?
I was horrified.
You have been warned.
You can do it any way you like.
I know her address.
No one told me that he had failed.
You forgot to put on your tie.
Food prices are at their highest level since the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization began keeping records in 1990.
I used to be like you.
Some animals can sense the coming of a storm.
I wish there were a French translation of this book.
Money has changed his life.
Do you want me to come back?
It's really cold tonight.
Please remember to wake me up at seven tomorrow morning.
What a beautiful sunset.
Let me buy you a new one.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
She doesn't hate him. In fact, she loves him.
We're going to have a good day.
More than half the residents are opposed to the plan.
Don't you feel stupid now?
It's rather hot out here.
That seems unlikely.
You often need to spend more time doing something than you anticipated.
You can't talk to me that way.
I will never forget seeing you.
I'm living in a small town.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Give me back my pencil.
He paid a visit to his friend.
We weren't as busy as I thought we'd be.
I don't have time to explain.
Can you tell me why Tom isn't here?
This isn't mine.
Tom tripped over something.
It was a national scandal.
I'm such an idiot.
I just don't want you making any mistakes.
I'm not avoiding you.
My boss has the ability to read books very fast.
Let's all go.
Is that what you really want to do?
I don't quite know how it happened.
I took another sip of wine.
I didn't know you could speak French.
How's your day going?
You'll need this more than I do.
Tom is the smartest kid in our class.
Let's not let this happen again.
We were just starting to do that when it started raining.
That was a warning.
I saw tears in his eyes.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
There is too much furniture in this room.
She didn't like her husband.
You're conceited.
How do I get to the train station?
Don't make me go.
No one could've predicted this.
Where are you from?
That's all I was interested in.
I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen.
The baby cried all night.
Coat the chicken breast with flour.
How much money did you spend on your car?
You're wonderful.
Are you contented?
The pressure is getting to him.
Tom is now in custody.
It's important that I hear this.
The Internet is now something we can't live without.
Tom hasn't eaten anything in the past 36 hours.
I found the book easy.
Take a breather.
Don't do too many things at the same time.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
You can only smoke on the patio.
I don't want Tom to know this.
Give me my drink.
I gave it to the little boy.
You're no help.
How do you plan to handle this?
Tom told me he'd do that soon.
That guy's a friend of mine.
Don't ever ask me to do that again.
They're hiding in the woods.
Tom has a big mouth.
I'm not crazy.
Iron is hard.
I didn't know how.
Keep searching.
I appreciate the courtesy.
I am not concerned with this.
Now I'm sad.
How far is it from here to the station? "It is about two miles."
I have some news for you.
I didn't have much time.
Tom doesn't seem much happier.
Tom's nose was red.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
He went deaf as a result of an accident.
A lot of wild animals died because there wasn't any food.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
Tom will be overjoyed.
Tom says he can't ignore Mary's behavior any longer.
The baby is crawling.
Do you know who those people are?
Do you understand me?
Please get out of my car.
We must not speak in the library.
His eyesight is failing.
I visited the town for the first time in a long time.
Tom's car caught fire.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Run for it!
I have no interest in dancing.
That man has a bad reputation.
I saw a stranger enter that house.
We'd do anything to help you.
I swear I'll never do such a thing.
Did I wake you?
I rarely listen to the radio.
He found out the secret.
She is busy preparing for an examination.
We went into the red last year.
I'm eating now.
We easily figured out the password.
Both of them started laughing.
Don't ignore her feelings.
Your hair will grow back.
We hope this never happens again.
It's very good.
They finished 13th.
We're worried.
I do not know when she can come.
Have you ever tried it?
The archer killed the deer.
They will debate the question tomorrow.
Do you realize the danger you're in?
You were the one who gave me that tip.
A man called on you last night.
They should have one.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
How's your new apartment?
Tom has trouble sleeping.
I prefer to write in French.
Can you sing a song for everyone?
Tom isn't going to listen.
The students walked in a single file.
I've been waiting for this moment all my life.
I don't want to listen to you.
I need someone to hold me and tell me everything will be alright.
You're not your normal self.
It's a doll.
It's pretty expensive.
Are you accusing me of something?
She wasn't polite to him.
I'd like you to meet him.
I don't have the option.
He mentioned it.
It took Rei 20 days to get over her injury.
We're all going home.
Why would I want this?
The plate is made of plastic.
Everything is extremely simple.
Many people use cash machines to withdraw money.
It's my brother's.
That doesn't sound so bad.
They were in the right place at the right time.
They built a safe building for earthquakes.
Tom said he just had to eat something right away.
A leap year has three hundred and sixty-six days.
I'm happy to be back.
Unfortunately, there was no one around.
I'm done with you.
She prepared a wonderful meal for us.
You can't help yourself.
Swimming should help you lose weight.
This carpet feels nice.
I was a teacher.
I don't care what you think.
Are you feeling sick?
They all went to the restaurant.
Should we have some lunch?
I’ll call you before I leave.
It's a small town.
Can you keep a secret?
I had nothing to do with that situation.
She gave birth to a pretty baby girl last week.
Should I be worried?
Kindly refrain from smoking.
You were watching, weren't you?
I don't think they heard us.
These peaches aren't very sweet.
Sign on this line.
She didn't want to sell the book.
You can't trust Tom.
I am only too glad to help you with your work.
He touched my shoulder.
His behavior is worthy of praise.
Where on earth have you been?
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
They married when they were young.
This is refreshing.
She also bought the dictionary.
Farmers separate good apples from bad ones.
I will shoot him.
The new model is expected to be put on the market early next year.
You can't be serious.
Even Japanese can make mistakes when they speak Japanese.
We can't do this again.
We complement each other.
I wrote that.
All his friends backed his plan.
Do you have work experience?
Don't cry over spilt milk.
Do you still not understand?
I wasn't there at that time.
We spent about three months in Boston.
You will save time if you adopt this new procedure.
I'm going to the post office to buy stamps.
Let me in.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
It's a bit strange as far as I'm concerned.
Something's wrong.
The equations are very complicated.
I felt like singing loudly when the exam was over.
My parents should be proud of me.
You're very skeptical.
No one was on board the ship.
I love everything about Tom.
He mailed a letter home.
It's still crowded.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I don't want you to worry about anything.
There are similarities.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
Rinse with warm water.
I can't swallow these tablets without a drink of water.
Some french fries, please.
I want to meet with Tom.
I thought you might help.
Look behind you.
I am glad that the matter was settled amicably.
She had the box carried to the first floor.
That was easy.
Your comments made Tom laugh.
Is this permissible?
If only he had been there.
One of us will have to go.
She doesn't have any enemies.
I never forgot you.
We're stuffed.
How can you sleep at night?
I'm glad I'm a man.
We often went skiing in the winter.
How did you get hurt?
I hate this school.
What's the plan, Tom?
There's nothing that can stop us now.
We are all set.
It takes years to master a foreign language.
I'll provide you with all the necessary information.
I wasn't the only one to do so.
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
Please don't cut me off like that.
Why is this website taking so long to load?
We found one large footprint and a couple of different size smaller footprints.
You have some books.
You should've told Tom that a long time ago.
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
I want to know who started it.
Everyone seems to be nervous.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
My father has just returned from abroad.
Stop acting like a child.
I don't like any of these records.
Can I take your order now?
I support you a hundred percent.
The value of the dollar is going up.
The next two years were busy ones for Jackson.
She suddenly became famous.
Grades are important, but they are not everything.
I seem to have caught a bad cold.
She kept me waiting for a long time.
We have to pay taxes.
I meant what I said.
I don't know what Tom said to Mary.
I miss you when you're not here.
Have you finished your homework?
If it had not been for his help, I would have failed.
Don't make me ask you again.
How about playing tennis next Saturday?
Tom and Mary will come at 2:30.
I found out who did that.
Please do not buy it.
His failure is due to his ignorance.
I never thought I'd want more.
Go to school.
Do you want me to handle this?
Don't forget your cigarettes and lighter.
He pointed to the tower over there.
Do you remember the day when we first met?
She asked if she could use the phone, so I let her.
Get me a ticket, please.
Her older daughter is married.
You may as well leave at once.
I'm going to open the wine.
He walks his dog every morning.
Pack your gear.
He's worried that he might be late.
What does your son do?
That's a frightening possibility.
What's the world's highest mountain?
All the children laughed at Tom.
He has a lot of land.
I think you're funny.
I like being with you.
Some fish are able to change their gender.
I should tell you something.
Isn't there something you want to say to Tom?
You should try not to scratch your mosquito bites.
I think this one is good.
There were 215 votes for the motion and 15 votes against it.
How are you planning to do that?
You have a great imagination.
I haven't eaten any meat since I was fifteen years old.
Put more salt in the soup.
There isn't room for everyone.
My mother often suffers from headaches.
What did Tom do?
This science-fiction novel is very interesting.
Are you busy Friday night?
I just felt like coming home.
It's fun to ride a motorcycle.
She is around twenty years of age.
Bring me the menu, please.
I felt relieved when my plane landed safely.
You have a great imagination.
I'm really sorry about last night.
Why don't you take a nap?
I'm not going to stay if you don't want me to.
He solved the difficult problem.
I thought you might want this back.
I don't care if you go or not.
May I ask you some more questions?
How unfortunate!
The glass is empty.
I saw him play baseball.
Tom works too much.
There are many shrines in Kyoto.
Can I tell you what bugs me?
Don't leave me.
Tom didn't bring his keys.
Tom pays his taxes.
I appreciate your advice.
Tom doesn't wear glasses, but he used to.
Times are tough.
All I want is for you to be happy.
I do not think that he will come.
He will be a good teacher.
Your camera is only half the size of mine.
You can't just come in here and start ordering people around.
Now that we've finished eating, let's go.
The sandwiches were delicious.
I'm not sure I'm ready.
Tom used to be a better cook than Mary.
This bike is easy to ride.
Drive safely.
I know Tom is a good boss.
Rainforests provide the earth with many benefits.
I lied to the police.
A known mistake is better than an unknown truth.
Are you unlucky?
This is all very disturbing.
Thanks for the food.
You must teach me what you know.
I even wrote Tom a letter.
It's about time I was going.
You're going to win today.
My brother has a gift for painting.
Since he was tired, he was sitting on the sofa with his eyes closed.
She made a bet with him.
Is my French really so bad?
Do you still believe that?
Would you like to talk?
It's like being a kid in a candy store.
You have to choose your own destiny.
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
Even Tom lied.
Nobody showed up.
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I don't care about your past.
Be seated.
You're crazy.
How did you find me?
Today is hectic.
Sooner or later, Tom will likely agree to help us.
We want peace.
The older we get, the weaker our memory becomes.
Get there early.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
You are crazy.
That's all I had to say.
French is Tom's native language.
They could do with our help.
We're not free yet.
I just wanted to see if you knew.
They rushed towards their mother.
Come back tomorrow.
I glanced through the brochure.
I want to see your supervisor.
May I ask where you work?
I don't regret what happened last night.
She is expecting a child.
Let's talk about what you did in Boston.
He seldom does anything he really hates to do.
Here she is!
My daugther wants a kitten.
Is that all you're worried about?
That man is a soldier.
Please put on your safety glasses.
You're loaded.
For some reason, people have been avoiding me like the plague ever since I got back from India.
Here's my telephone number.
We really enjoyed ourselves.
Tom can't make it tonight.
You can't stop progress.
That was unnecessary.
Tom hates speaking in public.
Short hair really suits her.
I want you to lay back and relax.
I hope I can be of some help to you.
You can wait here.
I don't feel like translating this sentence.
That's not quite right.
I had to do my duty.
By the way, I think you're really nice.
We have people everywhere.
This report is badly written and is full of mistakes.
I don't know why I thought it would be different this time.
You are tired, and so am I.
Where shall we begin?
I hate you.
Will you come back tomorrow?
You still haven't told me where you live.
I've been looking for my keys all day.
Without your help, I would have failed.
He moved close to her.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
Please shut the door behind you.
I'm so confused.
Did you write down the number?
My father is fifty years old.
I think Tom didn't tell us everything.
They got the short end of the stick.
I cannot help thinking that my son is still alive.
I felt sure this would happen.
I have a right to be happy.
I want to know why you're doing this.
Tom played a joke on his friend.
I'd love to dance with you.
Nothing is happening.
Tom has a very stressful job.
I listened, but I heard nothing.
Tom died instantly.
Am I really the only one here who doesn't understand French?
It wasn't much of an earthquake.
Please tell me what happened.
I'm on the balcony.
Tom was really crazy.
Could I have a glass of milk?
Children under three are admitted free of charge.
I think this medicine will do you a lot of good.
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
You are very insensitive.
It's only blood.
You're ambitious.
She got all dolled up for her big date.
Who would want this job?
I'm well aware of the risks.
I'll explain the rules.
This is Tom's locker.
I feel trapped.
I can't help anybody today.
Who needs a drink?
I want you out of my room.
He gave me all the money he had on him.
I always carry a bottle of mineral water with me.
Thank you for listening.
I can't. It's too big.
Discretion is the better part of valor.
You're a child.
Do you have any other questions?
Which reminds me, it's been more than 30 years since that incident.
Small children are very curious.
I don't belong.
We ran out of money.
I lost my job on Monday.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
Tom has three cows.
I was in a better mood three hours ago.
There's really nothing else to say.
I hope you like what I've just given you.
Please stop calling me that.
I was careless.
Why do you put up with that?
I'm taking care of my grandfather.
There are various kinds of candy in that bowl.
Did he tell you anything?
I don't know exactly when he will arrive.
May I ask you a favor?
I feel your pain.
She acted as if she knew nothing.
We'll come back later.
I want to talk to you alone.
I don't know what this is.
How many of you are going?
We're both fine.
We're looking for some computer-savvy people to work for us.
I'll put on some music.
Our guests are in a hurry.
Tom pressed a hidden button.
Since I've been on this diet, my weight is down, my cholesterol is down and my sleep apnea has completely disappeared.
It's essential that we find them.
I can't find my suspenders.
He's in hot water.
Maybe you should do this together.
You were right, you know.
Tom shouldn't have left so early.
Mary likes watching TV.
I gave him a book.
I'm unambitious.
I'm pretty sure Tom wasn't there.
I thought you needed money.
How do I get to the airport?
Tom didn't act quickly enough.
That doesn't give us a lot of time.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
They got married three months ago.
I don't know all of them.
I like cookies.
I live with my uncle.
Now that you are grown up, you must not behave like a child.
I don't consider Tom a friend.
You're conscientious.
If you don't eat, you die.
Loosen up.
He keeps two cats.
I'm doing the right thing.
I'm not ready for a change yet.
Let's hope Tom can fix this.
Tom has only one leg.
Since when do you have a problem with the death penalty?
She is not wrong.
What are your responsibilities?
If your schedule permits, let’s tentatively plan on meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm.
This is not my specialty.
That's not your job.
I cannot see this picture without remembering my childhood.
Have you already eaten?
You're naive.
It is too long ago.
She brought him to our place to meet my parents.
That was only a year ago.
I knew they were your friends.
Don't worry about what I did.
We're reliable.
Mary went on a voyage around the world.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Nothing can prevent her from marrying him.
Mother looked at me with tears in her eyes.
You should've gotten up earlier.
You're a funny guy.
Tom and Mary sang in the choir together.
I have to charge the battery of my car.
The meeting begins at three.
The meeting room is occupied at the moment.
Put your glasses on.
When I was in high school, I used to earn extra money babysitting.
He couldn't pass the entrance examination.
Let's find a solution that is acceptable to everyone.
I couldn't find it.
I can't believe you're doing this.
I had no idea you could speak French so well.
This could become a big problem.
Is that likely?
When did the show finish?
Are you hurt?
I don't know what to do with it.
I think it's a great idea.
Never trust a naked woman.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Main Street was blocked off all morning for the parade.
She advised him to go there alone.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
Go when you want.
Was that a yes?
I want you to return to your seat.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as I arrive.
I don't want to meet your parents.
We should probably go.
I need to borrow your pen.
E-cigarettes are being promoted as a healthy alternative to tobacco cigarettes, but health authorities are concerned about the long-term health effects on users.
This Sunday is Mother's Day in Spain.
I'm beginning to get scared.
He showed us some pictures.
You can't go alone.
I'm sick and tired of all this bickering.
I want you back here.
I don't want to be the person who tells Tom that.
The garage is dusty.
This law is applicable to all cases.
Is this ethical?
He's not in our group.
Where did the bee sting you?
Something was wrong with the watch.
I got a rash on my hands from dishwasher detergent.
I don't like the beach.
The house by the lake is mine.
I had to make a choice.
We're all working together.
How do you make your money?
What person does everyone take off his hat to?
I came into a huge fortune.
Anybody can participate.
I called home.
Are you ready to go out?
My orders are to go with you.
I knew Tom was in Boston.
Do you mind if I get started?
He removed his shirt.
I had a conversation with Tom.
My father is still ill in bed.
They're doctors.
Can you come with us?
If you have questions, don't hesitate to jump in.
I needed to meet you.
Hold on, please.
She wanted to spare him embarrassment.
Are you finished?
I don't care as long as you are happy.
What did I get?
He isn't as stupid as he looks.
Australia is smaller in size than South America.
Why did you turn away when you met him?
I love this sweater.
Tom didn't even want to eat.
It's quite difficult to master French in 2 or 3 years.
You can't leave until you've said goodbye to Tom.
Please find a solution to the problem.
Who will you go with?
Don't look down on others.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
I think that they were all fired.
You don't need to convince me.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his key.
Wouldn't you rather sit by the window?
We're satisfied.
From now on, I'm going to say what's on my mind.
I am fond of music.
I don't like this type of house.
The person we're trying to catch is very dangerous.
We're not dressed.
Tom helped you, didn't he?
Several soldiers were injured in the offensive.
She could not understand the whole story.
I'd love to hold you in my arms.
Don't be scared of making mistakes.
It is going to snow.
Apart from that, I don't know anything.
That's not what I'm going to do.
Nobody deserves that.
I was up almost all night.
This investment is the opportunity of a lifetime.
It's stealing.
Where've you been?
I'd like to learn how to arrange flowers.
I forgot to ask him.
Take his car keys.
Air the futon.
It's a pity you don't know how to dance.
Turn on the air conditioner.
That's precisely what I meant.
That box is bigger than this one.
Light is as necessary as water for plants.
They fell into the conversation immediately.
Have a donut.
This will keep you warm.
Willingness to correct is an indication of wisdom.
I came down with measles.
This is the only book I have.
Where's the rest of the money?
Which do you like better, this or that?
Tom doesn't want to leave.
Tom got an emergency call and had to leave work.
Can you pass me the salt?
We're not impressed.
Are you interested?
My cat loves toys.
They tried to cheer me up.
I know it's my fault.
Why do I have to do this by myself?
My heart was filled with happiness.
I need to warn my mom.
I hate to wait.
The story was very interesting.
I don't like apples.
It's possible that Tom lied to you.
I won't accept that.
I thought you didn't know that.
It's a matter of taste.
He's nothing more than a common thug.
I often feel homesick.
How are you holding up?

I thought you went home.
He stayed in London for a time.
You don't know that.
Would you like to have some tea?

Not everything can be explained.
I want to show you what Tom gave me.

I'm not angry!
Please turn off your engine.
You can run, but you can't hide.
Do you have any plans for today?
They are my classmates.

I eat alone.
The last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat vegetables.
What would you have me do?
This is by far the best.
He is at his office.
Duty calls.
Take any two cards you like.
I wanted to wish you well.
You could be a little nicer to your brother.
The coat is too big for Tom.

It was a partial success.
Come here.
Why do you let Tom to do this to you?
We are going to visit our aunt next Sunday.
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
Tom said he was starving.
He was a fresh face in American politics.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
He is running now.
He became a pianist.
How is that possible?
I am dumbfounded.
Finally, I found a job.
Perhaps you are mistaken.
You have a fertile imagination.
Do we have a babysitter for tonight?
Tom has three boys and a girl.
You're very stylish.
You need to sleep.
Tom didn't want me to sell my old truck.
I still think this is the best choice.
Can I have my bicycle back?
Please check all the items on this list.
I listened to his story.
Tom died a few days later.
Why leave the door open?
We'll have to finish this later.

I want you to speak frankly.
Move back a little.
She's in total denial about her husband's philandering.
My boss turned down his proposal.
Trust me, he said.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
Tom's French is actually not very good.
I went to a Catholic school.
Why don't you come over and eat with us this evening?
How do you think that makes me feel?
I don't find that comforting.
Tom is now three years old.
You'll never be able to keep it a secret.
For a long time, I used to believe the same thing you do.
There is no life without water.
This is mine.
No one is amused.
I just couldn't keep my eyes open.
I think the same as they do.

The dog is as good as dead.
What was in the envelope?
Did your mother make those?
He died yesterday.
He told everyone.
It's what I am.
I really can't talk about it now.

I'd like to discuss something with you.
Christmas is soon.
Tell us exactly what happened.
You cannot heal a broken heart.

I could say nothing.
Did you lose your car keys?
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer.
Don't run risks.
I get dizzy when I stand up.
They said that it was important.
We appreciate the support.
You should get your eyes checked.
Will you please show me the way?
Don't blame the messenger.
Tom has lots of money.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
Have you ever known me to be mistaken?
First, let's talk about what Tom did.
Do you have anything in mind?
Where is the pain?
I've always wanted to learn French.
I got soaked.
He can play the piano, the flute, the guitar, and so on.
Only one person knows the answer to this question.

I'm studying French because I need it for my job.
I have to be honest. I was a little bit nervous the first time I had an MRI scan.
We have plans.
My father is going to retire soon.
How would you reword this sentence to make it sound more natural?
The man you saw yesterday was my uncle.
I did that because everybody else did.
This is his.
I'm prepared.
Could you explain that?
He was surprised by what he learned.
Tom is a father himself.
I have a cut here.
How did Tom get that information?
Don't forget your money.
This one is all yours.
We're in the same boat.
He asked me to do it.
We have to be cautious.
How long will this take?
Who gave you these flowers?
I called you.
She was engaged as an interpreter.
We don't want to do anything hasty.
She's in the garden planting roses.
Did we win?
You deserve this.
Did you go out last night?
Which of these rackets is yours?
I want to get out of here.
We're ready now.
It wasn't a good experience.
Everybody sat down.
He was displeased with his neighbor.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
They were all dressed in uniforms.

Don't you check your voice mail?
Didn't your parents teach you anything?
Now drink up.
He took a deep breath before entering his boss's office.

What sort of things do you do on weekends?
Have you been told the reasons why we didn't hire you?
Are you free this weekend?
Who is the tall guy with long dark hair playing the guitar?
Don't go too far into the woods.

I'd like you to take this.
Give him an inch and he'll take a yard.
We're safer here than we would be in a city.
Tom died in the blast.
Why are you torturing me?
He felt very lonely.
I just have one quibble with this product.
Everybody has to do that.
The company abandoned that project.
I liked them before they were popular.
Your problem is you don't study enough.
How long will Tom be in Boston?
We abhor violence.
She feeds her dog the same thing that she eats.
I could really use a change in scenery!
The dog is panting.
I'll scold him.
I think Tom is loyal.
Why didn't the police notify us?
Up until now, they've been good neighbors.
See you tomorrow in the library.
I opened the door and saw two boys standing side by side.
What am I supposed to do with what you gave me?

Would you give me a discount?
Everything is different today.
How often do you check your messages?
We'll be working on that this week.
Why are you at home?
Smoke was rising from the chimney.
I'll give you five dollars.
I didn't scream.
My father finally compromised.
She will be in New York for two weeks.

She and I are brother and sister.
It's raining there.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?

I shouldn't have to tell you to do your homework.
Let's put off the meeting until next Friday.
Are you over your cold yet?
How much do you want to spend?
I hope Tom laughed at your jokes.
Did you try restarting the computer?
Don't speak so fast, please.
I ate a donut.
Check, please.
I kissed Tom.
Where should we do that?
Wouldn't that be fantastic?
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
He arrived there after dark.
I like your painting.
You shouldn't have done it.
They come from the same village.
What if they don't like me?
Tom and I never lie to each other.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
I wonder what that means.
Tom is at the neighbor's house.
I never was very good at math.
I won't miss Tom at all.

I said it as a joke.
He reached across the table and shook my hand.
Are you real sure about that?
It was a satisfying meal.
I'm dancing.
I bought a new suit.
I promised not to tell him.
Don't open the present yet.
Just tell me the truth. I promise I won't get mad.
I shouldn't have had to do that.
I can't ask you to take that sort of risk.
I'm really starting to worry about you.
Don't you feel stupid now?
Tom knows the police suspect him.
He was jailed on trumped-up charges.
I know a lot of people who can speak French.
I will ask you once.
Why didn't you go to the police?
We're here now.
Where do you live? "I live in Tokyo."
Advance two steps.

They look sad.
I was already tired.
You're not fooling anybody.
The clouds floating in the sky are beautiful.
Would you like one?
Please peel this orange for me.

Read as much as possible.
She can sing very well.

Tell me what really happened.
The child was afraid of being left alone in the dark.
This is the hottest summer that we have had in thirty years.
When I got out of prison, I couldn't find a job anywhere near my home since no one would hire an ex-con.
Don't get sidetracked.
He rushed out of the office.
Let me get that for you.
I won't be getting married this year. In fact, I may never get married.
Tom was stuck in a traffic jam for what seemed like hours.
Don't live like you want to, live how you can.
You're horrible.
She caught me by the arm and stopped me from going home.
I don't look like that.
Is she a computer programmer?
Tom opened the book and flipped through the pages.
Thank you for helping me find a good job.
What do you say to my plan?
I have to know why.
She goes jogging every morning before breakfast.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
We're learning Chinese.
If you want to be free, destroy your television set.

You've got nothing.
I wouldn't do that to anybody.
She had the box carried downstairs.
I don't watch as much TV as I used to.
Mary shaves her legs more often than Alice does.
Why can't we spend more time together?
I'm not sure what happened.
Tom sat on the tree stump, reading a book.
Do you belong to any clubs?
It didn't take you long to get here.
I hear laughing.
You must always do what is right.
We've all been there.
Everybody's so busy.
Why don't you help us?
You don't have the guts.
You have to adapt to circumstances.
Everyone knew that.
We're even.
You cannot take back what you have said.
I don't want your apologies.
I was too stunned to talk.
He needs you.
Could you call me back a bit later?
I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong.
We can't predict what'll happen.
His girlfriend did it for him.
He appeared young.
I found a nice place to have a picnic.
May I have your order, please?
The hungry cat kept meowing outside the window.
He was taken in by the salesman.
I know that this is the first time this has happened to you.
That won't be a problem.
This is a picture of you.
I think you're nuts.
I've just come up with a great idea.
What're the chances that Tom will actually get the job?
Thailand is in Asia.
I've found a new job.
I'm a year younger than Tom.
I thank you for your courtesy.
I treat everybody the same.
Tom got himself another beer.
I can handle this.
All of these are Tom's.
Keep an eye on my bag while I buy a ticket.
It can be frustrating.
We should get ready for work.
I'm being careful.
How well can you dance?
That's not your fault.
You must go up the hill.
You cannot be serious.
You're pretty.
This is disturbing.
We had fun, didn't we?
Was Tom telling the truth?
He's a bit naive.
I've got this one covered.
Tom punched Mary.
Nothing will take me away from you.
I guess that's why I love you.
He kept walking all the day.
I can't remember all their names.
I rested in the shade of a tree.
Maybe he's not young.
That might change things.
I did everything in my power to protect her from you.
Reading books will make you smarter.
The old houses were torn down to make room for a supermarket.
Thank you for your advice.
You've lost some weight, haven't you?
Kyoto is worth visiting once.
You must be very hungry now.
This is my favorite project.
I don't like studying.
You're a child.
I gather you were hurt.
You don't have to talk.
That's going to take time.
You're all happy.
You can't save me.
They all need attention.
Where do they live?
I want those kids to leave.
I ought to do this by myself.
I'm greedy.
Tom drives a big sedan.
I didn't want you to see me crying.
I enjoy eating with you.
Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
I dislike speaking in public.
He seems very pleasant.
Tom feels better now.
Here's what I learned.
Well begun is half done.
You're Canadian, right?
In 1683, the Turks besieged Vienna for the second time.
They are great friends.
I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.
She traveled around the world.

That's one of my favorite expressions.
Tom is my friend.
It was a weird feeling.
Do you have a problem with what was suggested?

She knows the truth.
What other choice did I have?
Tom is sleeping like a baby.
Can you tell me the exact time, please?
Did you get fired from your last job?
Water is essential to life.
I was afraid that I might hurt his feelings.
Are you going to have dinner at home?
It's not gonna bite you.
Tom likes to play baseball.
A bill came along with the package.
I don't want your apologies.
Leave your desk as it is.
I wanted to share it.
I wish you had told me the truth.
Would you say it once more?
I want to be invited.
We can't keep them in the dark forever.
Tom tends to only do what he's told to do.
Have you finished reading that book yet?
Is there any chance that you have eaten any of the contaminated food?
I think Tom will be coming later.
It is an option.
Your bike is better than mine.
They don't really care.
It's an ecological disaster.
The tactic worked.
Bring a lunch.
Tom is working as a security guard.
You will always be there.
Whenever you're in trouble or feeling down, I'll be there for you.
I remain skeptical.
If you see Tom, please tell him to call me.
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
Americans spend much of their free time at home.
They're twins.
I'm from the city.
My house is near the church.
You can use this pen for the time being.
I'd like to have my blood examined.
I will do that work on condition that I get paid for it.
Tom was dumped.
Rules are meant to be kept, not broken.
My aunt has three children.
Who exactly were they?
I appreciate the support.
Wait here.
Who is your lawyer?
A lot of people are now trying to sell their houses.
My grandmother lives in the country.

I have a pen.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm all yours.
The Rhine runs between France and Germany.
We should ask Tom to come back.
Have you ever read Gulliver's Travels?
Why didn't you call the police?
This is food.
You make it look easy.
I think that's a good idea.
Help me and I will help you.
Can you answer this?
Hold still.
Such a proposal would only be turned down immediately.
How strange life is!
Who was that girl?
Do you know what it's called?
Don't you want to be in love again?
I don't feel like talking.
You must teach me what you know.
Where's the bag?
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
I need to know what you saw that night.
What's your favorite lipstick brand?
Are you surprised?
I'm the one who built this.
Tom wasn't in his room this morning.
The middle finger is the longest.
Why don't we go check it out?
Give me a few.
How can we thank you?
How come you didn't say anything?
Smoking is a disgusting habit.
Tell me again where you live.
It looks like you want to say something.
Is this fake?
Tom is an octogenarian.
He held out a helping hand to the poor.
He got dressed and went outside.
Would you please fill out this form?
Which shoes are you going to put on?
I'm having a hard time with French grammar.
Tom told Mary that he had finished the work a few days ago.
He quickly runs out of breath.
We smiled.
Tom's dog left muddy paw prints all over his new carpet.
It's a Chinese company.
I really do have to go.
Do you have a backup plan?
They want you dead.
She will leave the hospital soon.
The pen is on the desk.
How did you manage to get Tom to help?
I don't care about any of that.
I don't remember that conversation.
It was raining around Chicago.
Taste this.
I give you two permission to do whatever you think is necessary.
Tom is waiting for Mary's call.
I wish that I could believe you.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
No one will ever find you.
She attracted our attention.
Can you show me how to tie a tie?
We're a little busy here.
I have a girlfriend.
He asked some questions of the lady standing next to him.
This is interesting.
She explained to him how to solve the puzzle.
I look on you as my best friend.
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
You can have a ride on my motorcycle.
Did you do something you shouldn't have?
I can't figure this out.
Let's get together the next time you come back to Boston.
Where have you been all this while?
The child is dirty.
Father laid his hand on my shoulder.
Will you have another slice of pie? "Yes, please."
Don't look at us.
Tom has a big mouth.
I also found this.
I'm checking options.
I didn't see him again after that.
It was truly a miracle.
The car broke down.
Please inform me of any changes in the situation.
I can buy one.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
Are you looking at me?
It was pretty frightening.
Tom has a lot of enemies.
I wear glasses.
I think it's time for me to change my plans.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive.
I don't know anything about racing.
Go right ahead.
I paid for them.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
I don't know anything about it.
Tom's crazy.
It's too late to do anything about that now.
I have a prior engagement.
I didn't recognize Tom.
They celebrated his success by opening a bottle of wine.
You don't really want that, do you?
Butter and cheese are made from milk.
I prefer coffee to tea.
I'm what the world calls an idiot.
We needed it.
Are you a teacher? "Yes, I am."
This is not a coincidence.
Everybody has secrets.
He was ashamed of his tears.
I really misjudged you.
I'm sure you must have a lot of questions.
I love going to the beach.
Aren't you and I friends?
You sound tired.
People will talk.
That's very nice of you to say.
Are you young?
You will soon get well.
He looked unfriendly at first.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
You're in luck.
Did you really warn Tom?
This work is simple enough that even a child can do it.
Are you having fun?
What are the dimensions of the room?
I said he could go.
Both he and I are high school students.
I was offended.
I take care of the garden.
I play a little guitar.
You must be in love.
I can walk to school in 10 minutes.
She is no longer the cheerful woman she once was.
Why do you think he said so?
It's too expensive.
Did you take the money?
Has Tom ever hit you?
Tom is John's twin.
What do you think of war?
Love is blind.
We have a stressful day ahead of us.
We didn't see you.
Mathematics is basic to all sciences.
The loneliness and drabness of working away from people are fatal to his best effort.
I hope we can fix that.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
We must tell him about it.
I bet you know French.
Tom looks happy.
Tom was having car trouble.
We'll need a head hunting agency to find the right man for this executive position.
Who would've done that?
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
I don't think Tom was drunk.
Come with me, will you?
Tom knows he's wrong, but he won't admit it.
You're the only person I know who can help me.
You can't have the job.
It was a tradition.
I don't know what that meant.
This is not going to end well.
Can I ask you something?
Would you show me some rings?
You get out only what you put in.
Who goes there?
For what purpose?
We all like you.
Don't worry. Everything's OK.
Tom didn't make a sound.
You don't seem very concerned.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
What you are saying does not make sense.
His troubles are not over.
That's the one thing I can't do.
I don't smoke or drink.
Let's all take a deep breath.
I was outdoors.
I know quite a few people who don't eat meat.
Tom doesn't need to know where I'm going.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
She believes her son is still alive.
I'd like to read some books about the Beatles.
I've got to get home.
You have to leave.
It's a bit flimsy.
Anyone home?
Do you want me to handle this?
I'm Canadian, too.
I have some things to take care of.
We know how important this is.
That was all Greek to me.
Tell me what happened that night.
He talks as if he were a teacher.
We're partners.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Why would you say that?
I can hear you, but I can't see you.
I am very curious.
What'll you do if someone sees you?
Tom told me he was looking for Mary.
Get out of the truck.
He broke in on our conversation.
Could I have a minute of your time?
He is afraid to swim.
If you don't miss the train, you'll get there in time.
I can't remember her name.
Tom is the captain of the soccer team.
A smell of lilies filled the room.
It's time for a break.
We've learned a lot, too.
Did you have fun?
I am forever in your debt.
Have a cookie.
I told Tom to ignore it.
He went to the dentist.
Don't you remember us?
I was there.
Help Tom.
I bear no grudge against you.
The professor smiled.
Tom does volunteer work.
Don't talk to me!
Don't judge me too harshly.
I cannot possibly do it.
I don't want to go to school.
When you get on the highway, shift into fifth gear.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
I felt sorry for you.
I'm getting used to doing that.
I live in Boston.
It is getting dark outdoors.
We miss you very much.
The most important thing in the Olympics is not to win but to participate.
I guess I don't understand what you're trying to say.
I need his help.
Who did it?
They made sure nobody could see them.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
We skipped his turn on purpose.
Take heed of her advice.
This is the best movie I've seen in a long time.
He doesn't seem to care.
Get off at the next stop.
I believe it will snow tomorrow.
We cannot offer a further price reduction under the current circumstances.
I guess Tom wasn't really Mary's boyfriend.
Could we talk in private?
You look just like your father.
That's more recent than you think it is.
You're unbelievably stupid.
It's not a weapon.
Keep listening.
Her name was unknown.
They're in danger.
You don't seem too happy to see me.
I've had a good day so far.
He may be the very man that I need.
I can't do what you want.
Your friends are waiting for you.
You're depressed, aren't you?
She dumped me.
All the girls wanted to dance with Tom.
Is bigamy a crime in Australia?
This book is available at one shop only.
The human skull consists of 23 bones.
My father encouraged me to learn how to play the piano.
You ought to have seen it.
Tom asked Mary whether she'd like to go shopping.
Does anybody have a can opener?
We can't do this without some help.
He took credit for my idea.
There's somebody at the door.
Mother made me a new suit.
That's true, too.
At the party, everybody was well-dressed.
Why are you angry with him?
We can't find Tom.
Everybody was startled.
Do you really think Tom is happy?
Our school library is small, but new.
Look out for pickpockets on crowded trains.
Go outside.
I barely managed to finish the letter by eleven o'clock.
Do you want to try it?
I like this one even better.
That was a pretty good movie.
His story amused everyone.
When did you do this?
We're not gonna make it.
Her smile expressed her thanks.
Why are you leaving so soon?
I like reading books.
He's a man of his word, so you can count on him.
Be ruthless.
Wait for your sister.
They always go skiing in the winter.
This changes everything.
Think of your brother.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
I know what they are.
What did you say his name was?
Tom sat down on the couch.
Did you go to Tom's party last Saturday?
How do I know this is real?
Corporal punishment is still allowed in many countries.
Keep trying.
She said that she had been happy.
He could show his feeling with music instead of words.
I have a terrible toothache.
What are we doing today?
Come on.
Please get all of your junk out of this room.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
You scared the living day lights out of me!
No one will know I'm here.
All I think about is you.
You're invited.
I bought a new car.
Ah is an interjection.
I went home to change my clothes.
He wanted to test his limits.
I've never worn a tuxedo.
I slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk.
Murder is punished by death.
Tom and Mary did that together.
What can I tell Tom?
Europe is not a country.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
He ordered the book from the publisher in the United States.
That's all I can ask.
I prayed for God's help.
I forgot the PIN number.
I returned the book to the library.
I didn't ask you to stay with me.
I recognized the name.
You're lucky to have such a good job.
You can't use this.
What part is wrong?
Who left the door open?
Would you like to switch seats?
Don't forget to take your pills.
She sleeps with two pillows.
Tom learns fast.
Your parents were right.
They're not dead.
Were you here last week?
We'll try to be more careful the next time.
Raise your hand before you answer.
This room is very stuffy.
I want to sit down.
We received instructions on how to make a bamboo basket.
Have you asked if they want one?
You're really awesome.
I'd like to say a few words.
I'll get him to carry my suitcase upstairs.
Stop! You're hurting him!
Why are you so busy?
I'd like to file a complaint.
I do not deserve it.
I know the man you came with.
You are wanted on the phone.
Everyone can do better.
I'm not worried about you.
My work is my passion.
I never felt comfortable around your parents.
Plants need water and sunlight.
I suppose it's possible.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
I just thought you might want to go skiing with us.
You can sleep here for a while if you want to.
What a drag!
Your office is nicer than mine.
Do you need much money?
Fortunately, I have a green thumb.
You're a romantic.
He wrote a book about the American Civil War.
The village needs your help.
Get out of the van.
It's a disgrace.
I want a low table.
We're not happy.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Take lots of vitamin C to avoid catching cold.
I've known Tom for quite some time.
Tom is a fairly good swimmer.
He lived a happy life.
Time flies like an arrow.
Tom poured milk on his cereal.
We need a distraction.
I was a fool for marrying someone like her.
That made me very sad.
I can't help you this week.
It wasn't enough.
What time is it now by your watch?
Where do you live?
I wish we'd bought another bottle of wine.
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
Japanese houses are small.
Don't judge me too harshly.
Do you like me, too?
We're blood brothers.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Can you make the deadline?
Work is behind schedule.
Some children are swimming in the river.
I really tried.
What do you think caused him to lose his job?
Please do not kill me.
Can you come?
Get down!
These are decisions I want to make alone.
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
How do you account for that?
I appreciate the hospitality.
I can't continue doing this.
Don't worry about it.
Stay away from that.
You can't know that for sure.
I was deceived by a person who I had thought was a friend of mine.
I really need to go home and catch some zees.
I'm fasting.
You have three choices.
Take no prisoners.
What are you doing these days?
I thought you were going to stay home.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
She still loves him even though he doesn't love her anymore.
It happened three hours ago.
She couldn't convince him to ask for a loan.
A camel is a horse designed by a committee.
Stop yelling.
He went to work in spite of his illness.
Where is the elevator?
I'm really proud of you.
He is well-liked.
The secret of life is hanging around until you get used to it.
I had a snack before I went back to work.
Tom knows Mary's weaknesses.
He's raking it in.
I know it's hard to walk away.
I tried to maintain my composure.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
Do you think the situation will improve?
I'd better not eat that.
Why aren't you all laughing?
Surround yourself only with people who are going to lift you higher.
That was nothing.
Tom had expected something quite different.
This is unbearable.
I'm proud of myself.
Tom ordered a bottle of champagne.
Soon it will be gone.
I walked toward the park.
He is a bad driver.
How did you manage to do that?
I'm famished.
We're special.
I've got accustomed to speaking in public.
I can't answer that.
I like to look at old pictures.
She has the bad habit of always being late.
She was panting.
He came to ask us to help him.
What country were you born in?
I hope you will call again.
This glass contains water.
Is it time to leave?
Your name is Tom, isn't it?
He introduced his sister to me.
The world is changing every minute.
Let's make a phone call.
She is busy cooking dinner.
Be proud of yourself.
I only wish I were able to help.
Please stop talking.
She scolded him.
When do you plan to start?
The house is too small for five people to live in.
You need to study harder.
Use your common sense in that kind of a situation.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
Educational reforms still have a long way to go.
I can't take that risk.
I don't know whether I'll be able to attend tomorrow's meeting.
We are all convinced of his innocence.
I lost the bet.
A day has twenty-four hours.
He said two or three words and left.
At what time is dinner served?
I didn't hear what you said.
Take your umbrella with you in case it rains.
Our house faces the beach.
They will have a good laugh when they see you like this.
You won't need me.
I lost everything.
Roll down your window.
Tom and I haven't seen each other since our divorce.
Stop teasing me.
May I come in?
I owe you a lunch.
I didn't think it would be that much.
I met him by pure chance.
I like to talk about the good old days.
He's been sick. "Oh really, I hope it's nothing serious."
The kitchen chairs aren't stackable.
I pretended that I was working.
I can't stand staying indoors.
Let's put it to a vote.
Are you blackmailing me?
There you are.
They were buying time.
You have only to ask for it.
Don't ask me to do that.
I think you're bleeding.
You are old enough to make your own living.
My mother is their mother's sister.
To drive a car, you need a license.
Where have they gone?
We have a half-dozen eggs.
Are you lost?
Did he look like a doctor?
I thought Tom didn't drink.
I have no siblings.
I gave Tom many chances to do that.
Tom's French is improving.
I'm still not impressed.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Don't rely too much on your guidebook.
I want to keep one.
Would you show us some samples of your work?
Our school has about one thousand students.
Are you getting paid for this?
The family had been sleeping for about two hours when the fire broke out.
If only I'd done my homework!
You'd better go to bed.
Sleep is essential to health.
She did not walk to the gym.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
I have many friends I can talk to.
The beach was crowded with tourists.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
She called while I was out.
I never wear a hat.
I smoke cigarettes.
That's why Tom and I were disappointed.
Birds fly south in the winter.
Only I could answer the question correctly.
This hurts more than you can imagine.
I don't like that either.
It's been a long time since I've had a real vacation.
We never had that opportunity.
Animals can't tell what's real and what's fake.
She told him to try harder.
The doctor examined the baby.
Some children are playing on the grass.
Please do it this way.
I did it without you.
I can tell by his accent that he is German.
This coat fits me well.
This is your fate.
I've received it too.
I think we should wait a little longer.
Tom didn't seem to be very hungry.
I want you all to myself.
Do you think animals have a soul?
I had some things to do before the meeting.
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
We went on a really long walk.
The thieves made off with the jewels.
Tom drove us back home.
I'm developing an Android application.
That happens a lot.
I couldn't figure out how to do it.
We will make every effort to do so.
That's all I got.
We all miss you very much.
My parents have kicked me out of the house.
You should ask Tom for advice.
They tapped the terrorists' phone lines.
I bought her a new car.
In Japan, bowing is common courtesy.
He was out of breath.
It is high time you spilled the beans.
What's the solution?
I don't like profanity.
The doctor advised him not to smoke.
I thought the same thing.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
I said to myself, "I wonder what she means."
Can't you see I'm busy?
I can't wait until tomorrow.
Tom and Mary are both thirty, but they look much younger.
I never thought it would be this bad.
I didn't know that you could drive.
You never should've done that.
They waved flags to welcome the princess.
It'll be better next time.
I started that.
The talks continued for two days.
Do you want anything?
I can't imagine it.
Last year, I decided to come to Japan.
Is your name on the list?
I love to eat cakes.
They slept in the same room.
I didn't like the result.
Get my rifle.
Are you going to come visit me?
I relied on him.
They never found out the truth.
I know how old you are.
He laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair.
I think I'm going to buy one of those.
I couldn't get out of my garage because there was a car in the way.
I put my clothes in the dryer.
They furnished the library with many books.
I need some water.
What a big pumpkin!
I love the way you kiss.
He wouldn't believe us.
You should cut up your meat before you eat it.
I know Tom is tough.
It's really hard to choose the right color.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
What he's saying is actually true.
I like to add basil to season my spaghetti sauce.
Tell Tom I don't have his money.
Tom spent three weeks in Boston.
They bought a home with a pool.
All our teachers were young and loved teaching.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
I'm not sure what's wrong. We should have heard from him by now.
Armies invaded and conquered the enemy territory.
Do not take any notice of him.
Is this a bad sign?
Tom stared in disbelief.
I'm certainly not your friend.
Crime is down.
I did my homework yesterday.
That's not enough.
She kept crying all night.
I can't stand listening to loud music.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
It's your turn to sing.
I'd heard you'd changed.
I had a very tight schedule last week, but this week I'm relatively free.
I came with my friends.
I would really like to explore this cave.
Write me sometime, OK?
He didn't stop talking.
Smoking affects our health.
What's this doing here?
He is having coffee now.
The cops are here.
I'll never tell.
Give me a minute to think about it.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
Stop being a baby.
I think you're ready.
Can you see?
It's a problem any way you look at it.
I am in the classroom.
If you see or hear anything, let me know.
They asked me for my name, my address, and the purpose of my trip.
The store was not a big one, was it?
I'm sorry, but I can't find the book you lent me.
That's not for me to say.
Will she forgive him for forgetting her birthday?
Which planet is closest to the sun?
Tom is too young.
Tom stepped on Mary's foot.
I don't work like that.
No one uses that kind of weapon anymore.
I feel safe here.
You have such a beautiful name.
From the buyer's point of view, the prices of these CD players are too high.
Generally speaking, women live longer than men.
We can't leave our tents on the beach where they are now. If we do, they'll be under water during high tide.
You can probably guess what happens though.
These kittens are so cute and cuddly.
I just wanted to talk to you.
A walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Where are the scissors?
You must keep this machine free from dust.
Where were you yesterday evening?
The government should invest more money in industry.
Do you feel like a drink?
I rang the bell.
I want a dozen cream puffs.
She is a doctor.
Tom never wanted to be lawyer.
No one is immortal.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
Come over.
The old man looked wise.
Don't you think it's strange that he's not here?
What is your age?
Tom fired Mary.
I'm not sure what happened.
I study at the library.
There's no difference.
He drives a hard bargain.
The Golden Gate Bridge is made of iron.
I entered her room.
I must protest.
Tom anonymously donated a million dollars to his favorite charity.
He has already gone out.
Wait until your father gets home.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
We're done.
Just don't tell anyone, OK?
I never meant for any of this to happen.
Have you ever been to an opera?
I was just messing around.
That guy is an outlaw.
He must be over fifty.
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
There's no danger now.
It's popular among senior citizens.
Factories were producing more than ever before.
I'll do anything to get Tom back.
She was approaching thirty when I first met her.
Have you got it yet?
I was really proud of that.
That was the idea.
Where is the cat?
This is how it is.
Spit it out, Tom.
The problem is being discussed now.
Tom prepared a healthy meal for Mary.
Exams are right after summer vacation.
Do you want to go for a swim?
I was conscious that something was missing.
You can tell me anything.
I won't say it again.
Get out of my bed.
I trust we understand each other.
My parents are arguing again.
I thought you might want to know.
Simplicity is a virtue.
Tom has three kids.
Although I was exhausted, I continued to work.
What's the spelling of your family name?
He will wait.
Why did you use up all the money?
It is an act of cruelty to lock a small child in his room.
She refused to accept the money.
He returned to Japan.
Let's bounce.
What's Tom's real name?
I need to take your pulse.
Can this be just between you and me?
I have proof.
Don't push this button.
Check out these stats.
I know why Tom doesn't want to dance.
You probably already knew that.
Just give me some time. I'm sure I can figure out how to solve the problem.
I used to drink beer.
I will give you a bike for your birthday.
You have to take in my jacket.
He explained to me that he had no money.
Do your own job.
Give the dog some water.
Don't hurt anyone.
The last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat vegetables.
I just want people to like me.
Be careful, Tom.
We remember.
That's idle talk.
I wish I had brought a map.
What is your blood type?
Does she know you?
The day is getting longer and longer.
I believe I can trust you.
Modern cats don't eat mice.
You have to live with it.
What is this vase made of?
Father is having a bath.
I think we should go.
Don't open the present yet.
I feel bad.
This is unsatisfactory.
What're you saying?
Would you like to try it again?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Should I call you a cab?
Keep focused on your work.
He was hurt in a car accident.
I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday.
I don't think this is for you.
Only you can answer the question.
What do you want to do when you grow up?
Do you want us to call you?
Draw a picture of yourself.
Can you remember how slow the Internet used to be?
Are you certain about this?
I said that I was confused.
You should've stayed in Boston.
He claimed to be an expert in finance.
I was speaking.
Are you ready now?
It's not fair to attribute your failure to your parents.
I have to get up quite early tomorrow.
Mary said Tom was in trouble.
I'd like you to cut my hair.
Do you think you'll stay long?
I love music, too.
Give me a minute, would you?
It's about time somebody did something about the high cost of medical care.
From a literary point of view, his work is a failure.
Did you guess the end of the story?
Do you like bananas?
I'll be there at two o'clock without fail.
How many prefectures are there in Japan?
I thought that I saw a ghost.
Tom spent a week in Boston.
Are Mary and Alice really sisters?
Some people have all the luck.
I asked him many questions about ecology.
They were victorious.
Nobody has made a decision yet.
I dropped my phone.
Why would I be mad?
She does not have much money.
Plants require CO2 to grow.
The team approved his proposal.
We've done all we can.
How many times did you talk to Tom last week?
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
I'll call him tonight.
Your shelf is full of books.
Do we need a Plan B?
I went to the mall with my friends.
Move away from me.
Do you have a bicycle?
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
Let me show you how to do that.
What will losing the war mean to us?
I can't remember.
I couldn't find it.
Cats are cute.
You're out of luck.
We went to the same high school.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
I want to talk to you about this list.
Two boys are absent from school today.
I want to spend more time doing things that matter.
I won't pay for that.
Shake my hand.
I'd like a little help.
I promise you I'll never leave you.
Why did you kiss me?
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
Tom is packing.
We're choosing among those ideas.
I don't like being treated like a child.
We had some chicken soup.
Will you help me for a minute?
It was a busy day.
Not all Americans shared Wilson's opinion.
I don't need your money.
That happens to us a lot.
I'm learning French now.
Exams are right after summer vacation.
I'm happy to see you here.
Sport knows no borders.
I don't like silence.
He doesn't speak my language.
Control yourself.
I didn't learn anything new.
You disobeyed a direct order and must pay the consequences.
Come whenever you want to.
Sorry, the line is busy now.
You won't get there on time.
Do you take me for a fool?
Tom burst out laughing.
I get goose bumps when I see a horror movie.
Would you teach me how to dance?
I think everything is ready.
If you do your best, you're likely to succeed.
We all understand.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice all went to the park to play on the merry-go-round.
I feel a lot better now, but I know Dad's going to be real upset.
I'm going to enjoy this.
He was the only one who came to the party.
I'll excuse your carelessness this time.
That would be funny.
Stay with us for a few days.
Don't be so impatient.
I love hiking.
He was listening to music in his room.
I'm wide awake.
Aren't you the doorman?
He is unfit to be a teacher.
Tom knows the game is over.
She was hungry enough to eat anything.
At what time did the show finish?
She was ready to help him with cleaning the house.
This flower is beautiful, isn't it?
Where is the station?
Silver costs less than gold.
I was trapped in a vicious circle.
He's really in good shape.
I don't think it's a bad thing.
Learning foreign languages is boring.
I know that Tom knows.
Respect your elders.

Do you want to get drunk?
We estimated the damage at $1,000.
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
What language is spoken in Egypt?
They handled it well.
There are a thousand meters in a kilometer.
How did you pass the time?
I usually go shopping on Sunday afternoon.
They let me pick a present.
The company spends a lot of money on advertising.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Food is necessary for life.
What kind of funeral do you want?
I don't expect help.
I'm using that cup.
A wink was his only answer.
We will not fail.
Does that mean you bought it?
She went to Italy to study literature.
Don't back away.
What scared you?
Don't fish in this river. It's prohibited.
May I have a straw, please?
Air is lighter than water.
You know as well as I do that Tom isn't a very good singer.
You never told me you had a brother.
We have to start at once.
What do you think of these?
Over three thousand people attended the concert.
There's usually someone here.
I was surprised by what I learned.
We're very busy.
I hid it under the mattress.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
Dogs bark.
The policeman didn't believe the thief.
She sent you her best wishes.
I'm bleeding.
I'm afraid so.
He paused to look at the poster.
Tom isn't really Canadian.
I really don't want to miss that.
My cousin is having a baby next month.
It's a rough neighborhood.
I believe that story.
I have been working for this newspaper for 4 years.
That'll buy us a little time.
This bread is hard as a rock.
What's Tom drinking?
The disease spread in several ways.
The exam was very difficult.
Don't you think I know my own father?
Why are they doing this?
Tom stepped forward.
Here's the bill.
What is it you have in mind?
We've all done that.
Everybody speaks well of her.
I worried, of course.
I'm shopping.
The helicopter landed on the roof.
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
I was expecting a tougher game.
He laid down the gun.
I think I'm ready.
The alarm sounded.
I can't wait forever.
I thought you had more sense than that.
Do what I say.
What is the depth of the lake?
She looked me in the eye.
I have plenty of friends.
Open the door, please.
I can't believe that just worked.
Tom can speak neither French nor English.
They found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.
You're more beautiful now than the day I first met you.
Be proud of yourself.
We didn't learn anything.
I worked hard all day, so I was very tired.
All of the students have to wear the same uniform.
Dry your eyes.
Could you please be quiet?
What are you doing these days?
I realize that.
When I opened the door of the refrigerator, an apple fell out.
You're a good man.
I think that someone followed me.
Can I give you a hug?
What did they expect?
I sure wish you would leave.
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
You should not break your promise.
We'll explain.
This doll has big eyes.
I see they've put you to work.
You party too much.
Mathematics is an interesting subject.
You're really absent-minded.
We accepted his invitation.
I know you're going to say no.
We play soccer every Saturday.
He was checking you out.
We're open tomorrow.
I was home for a couple of days.
I appreciate that very much.
I have good hearing.
If your tooth hurts, you should see a dentist.
I lost my wife last year.
Why would I tell anyone?
Tom and Mary both left the room at the same time.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
I've got a bad case of jet lag.
I'd like to get married.
That ended better than I expected.
Did they tell you why you had to do this?
You're very understanding.
She used margarine instead of butter.
I'm a little bit jealous.
This dress would look good on you.
I was pretty hard on Tom.
I don't feel like working today.
It is no good to you.
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast.
I cough a lot.
I had to cancel my trip on account of the strike.
Do you come here a lot?
Get your mother.
Don't play games with me.
You will regret this.
Stop being stupid.
I want to stay with you.
I don't know what it is.
We've all seen it.
He read the article over and over again.
Any clever boy can do it.
Why isn't anybody doing anything?
You did it!
After three drinks, the man passed out.
Stop acting like a baby.
Is that Tom's daughter?
Are you willing to take that chance?
I've got a busy schedule.
Can I come over?
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
He suggested that I accompany him to the party.
I don't believe anything you say anymore.
He is opening the window.
His report does not sound true.
A cat has two ears.
I know the consequences.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
Tom is going to go swimming this afternoon.
That rule doesn't apply in this situation.
Let's start tonight.
We need a medic.
I'm not accustomed to such treatment.
I'd like to find out what this is.
He's broke.
I've been reading this for a few hours.
We want you to sing the song.
I will stay there.
He dreamed about his home.
It is on this point that our opinions differ.
It's all your fault.
Have you ever fallen asleep in a meeting?
I'm too tired to think.
She has three times as many dictionaries as you do.
In the summer I wear short-sleeved shirts.
You explained that well.
They hired someone else for the job.
Please put out your cigarettes before entering the museum.
He met a nice young man.
My mother has a red apron.
Please follow the nurse's directions.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
Are you comfortable?
I know who lives in that house.
She went to bed early.
I'm really proud of those guys.
I'm waiting for her to come here.
This is what'll happen.
She might be seriously ill.
Tom forgot to bring a flashlight.
This is someone I want you to meet.
Did you hear that?
We have to do this now. "There's no time."
I don't really know you.
Mary isn't my girlfriend. She's just a friend.
Tom hoped Mary wouldn't find out about what had happened.
None of us is perfect.
I decided to buy a car.
I can hardly imagine him going abroad.
Tom is studying.
The driver sustained multiple injuries.
I don't know why you don't like Tom.
A plane is flying above the city.
It may snow.
He is an American.
You're both pretty.
What is your greatest strength?
I want to quit.
Memorize it.
Long, long ago, there lived an old man in a village.
Are you sure we have enough food?
Tom lived in his car for a while after he broke up with Mary.
I was dancing.
The ice is very thick.
I wonder whether Tom will go to Boston or Chicago next summer.
Are they friends of yours?
There are seven days in a week.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
They enjoyed themselves at the party.
I can't do that, sir.
He was just in time for the last train.
We're investigating the murder of Tom Jackson.
Let's grab a quick lunch at that small coffeeshop near the park.
This train is made up of seven cars.
It can't hurt you.
She blackmailed him.
Are you close to your family?
She suddenly lost consciousness.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
This is my dog.
We're missing something here.
She was overcome with happiness.
I'm not sure what I should do.
He did not sleep a wink.
I gave my seat to the old lady.
I'd prefer a brown one.
Cats are smarter than you think.
Read all the instructions carefully.
Tom had dirt underneath his fingernails.
Sorry, I must have dialed the wrong number.
I sat down next to him.
I saw a very good movie last weekend.
Only one person survived the accident.
I just feel a little dizzy.
What are you up to?
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope.
I don't watch that show.
She is getting breakfast ready.
I can't necessarily agree with you on that point.
He must be a fool to talk like that.
Don't be afraid of seeing the doctor.
I'd been on my own all week and was starving for conversation.
I won't lose anything.
You only have to ask for it.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
Do you love my brother more than me?
Tom is the boy I told you about.
I think Tom needs to go.
Once bitten, twice shy.
He has braces.
I reconsidered your offer.
The committee members are all present.
I borrowed this comic from his sister.
I'll handle this.
He seems to have lived in Spain.
Creationism is a pseudo-science.
No matter what you say, I won't give up.
She clearly does not mean it.
I would do anything to get a job.
Have you ever tasted such a good soup?
Please give me one of these.
I'm not ready to retire yet.
Who hired you?
I love being alone.
Just tell Tom to leave me alone.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
Your answer is wrong.
Did you get the loan?
The sun is a star.
We missed the deadline.
Give me the same, please.
Tom is lying.
He made her cry.
Keep away from the dog.
I don't know if you'll be here when I return.
I support you whole-heartedly.
They can't start without me.
I'm a surfer.
It's finally my turn.
I won't tolerate such language!
I need medical help.
Where do you get off telling me that?
I wish you two the best.
I awoke to find a bird in my room.
My mother anticipates all my desires.
I know who it is you're looking for.
I only have butter in my refrigerator.
You're very rude.
Were you able to get the dishwasher to work?
Tom wanted to tell the truth.
The book is on the table.
Don't touch me, you pig!
Can I borrow this for a little while?
I'm going to join the army.
Don't you think it a bad thing?
They work at night.
Today I got to meet my new philosophy teacher.
Tom expected Mary to believe everything he said.
I felt comfortable.
I haven't been back here since that unfortunate incident.
The kids are asleep.
What are we doing?
Put on your pajamas and go to bed.
The play begins at 2 p.m.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
How old is this tree?
Everyone seemed sad to see Tom go.
A tall building was built next to my house.
Please keep me updated.
I prefer that it stay that way.
It was very scary.
You can't hate the guy.
I think you're being a little too careful.
That made me very sad.
I know Tom is a Canadian.
We certainly hope not.
There are many different ways of doing this.
I know a faster way to do this.
Any further discussion is pointless.
That's really nice to hear.
That's very serious.
I don't want Tom to wake Mary up.
I wish Tom wouldn't keep telling everyone I'm his brother.
Where can I buy some toothpaste?
The doctor treated her injury.
I managed to get rid of him.
You've gone too far.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
I nailed it.
Many people attended Tom's funeral.
I outwitted him.
I was the last in line.
She rubbed her eyes.
What's the time?
Please deal the card.
I know you're richer than me.
I got to the station only to find that the train had just left.
Another ten years went by quickly.
We can't wait for the weekend.
I lost my phone.
We had a big snow storm last weekend.
I didn't like any of these books.
He made up a pretext for a fight with me.
Those are my trousers.
He paid no attention to my advice.
May I see you in private?
It was a miracle.
I always wanted a tree house.
The scientist is famous both at home and abroad.
What time do you usually get up?
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Keep going! You're on the right path.
I thought Tom would need help getting in and out of the bathtub.
They set a new record for the longest kiss.
Do you like mine?
I took an arrow in the knee.
Where would you want to live?
Your theory has no scientific basis.
I like each of them.
You haven't seen Tom this morning, have you?
Your efforts will bear fruit someday.
I don't care what you think of me.
I don't like to make mistakes.
It happened at a quarter past eleven.
I think that would be best.
Why did you back away?
When will you be back?
People often refer to themselves in the third person when talking to children.
What makes you think that'll work?
I've already sent an email to the support department.
He used to be a quiet man.
Your pants are too tight.
They were attacked.
There may be a way.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
I haven't told anyone.
I think you should go to college.
Tom knows that won't work.
His doctor advised him to quit smoking.
I just want to have fun.
When did all this happen?
Tom is aggressive.
We all know Tom.
I informed him of her arrival.
I think it's a bad idea to loan Tom money.
This is your dog.
We waited, but Tom didn't come.
I think it's about time we got started.
Where did you hear that story?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
That's what you've always wanted.
I got an A on my essay.
You may choose whichever book you like.
My hair is as long as Tom's.
The terrible scene sent shivers down his spine.
I'd rather not eat this.
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
He has made me what I am.
She advised him about what to do.
Does he go to school by bus?
Her house is across the river.
I thought it was the perfect time to leave.
I regret doing that.
Please look for it.
He came when I was out.
They revolted against the government.
Is he all right?
I was tired so I went to bed.
It's really embarrassing.
I didn't work yesterday.
He is likely to be late for school.
It's crowded today.
Tom loves you. I know he does.
I appreciate your efforts to help me.
Just give me a little time.
It is not so difficult as you think.
I want to enjoy it.
I just got a job.
I don't have a girlfriend.
This building is about to collapse.
He ran away from home.
I met my teacher on the way to the station.
Tom liked to keep to himself.
The airline sent my suitcase to Boston by mistake.
Call me back.
It's so beautiful.
I didn't mean to surprise you.
Did you speak at all?
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
Please show me this book.
I'm still hungry.
He who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing.
Buy a book and read it.
You're the only person I can trust.
Are you finished with your work?
What is your specialty?
I'm not cooking.
I don't have any objections.
Better bread without butter than cake without freedom.
He is my uncle.
You can't be too careful these days.
She did it again.
Forget I said anything.
It wasn't funny.
I told Mary that I loved her.
If you want that, you can have it.
What do you say to calling it a day?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
You gotta get more organized.
I have to be there at 2:30.
Nothing's been changed.
He wants a watch just like yours.
Can I come in now?
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend.
The twins smiled.
He's a slacker.
I have to work tomorrow.
Tom bought me this book.
The hunter shot a bear.
I don't like being surprised.
Tom worked all day.
It's a lot of fun skiing in fresh snow.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
Lincoln set out to abolish slavery in the United States.
I'll handle it.
He must be homesick.
He smoked a cigar after lunch.
I know a lot about it.
Take a bath.
I'm addicted.
The apartment building is on fire.
Tom is hiding somewhere.
Me, too.
We meant no harm.
The article alludes to an event now forgotten.
I love reading books.
When did Tom arrive?
I missed going out with her and eating at our favorite restaurant.
This is what I wanted.
You didn't say that before.
What can I do for you?
Stop pretending that everything's okay. It's not.
I want to do this at home.
It's just not safe.
Aren't you feeling well?
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a moment.
I've been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
I hear she is going to get married next month.
I thought Tom and Mary were both dead.
You should go now.
It doesn't matter which side you're on.
Have you learned nothing from your mistakes?
Can we make one of those?
She may not come.
We have to pay for everything.
I can't wait any longer.
Where do we get the textbooks?
I really think you should leave.
Tom was fed up with waiting for Mary.
This glass is dirty.
Can I have a bit more milk?
It was raining yesterday.
How much does this book cost?
Don't ask me why.
Do you put sugar in your coffee?
It is probable that she will win the speech contest.
It doesn't go far enough.
Come off it!
That fact can't be denied.
Please don't do anything stupid.
Tom was heartbroken when Mary told him she was leaving him.
I could have done it without your help.
It is not surprising that he was elected mayor.
I will stay home if it rains tomorrow.
Don't tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend.
You may not learn to speak as well as a native speaker, but you should be able to speak well enough that native speakers will understand what you have to say.
Do you want a job?
The first word of an English sentence should be capitalized.
Red wine, please.
It's really cool here.
You can't see me, can you?
I want this suit cleaned.
Don't be fooled by her appearance.
Don't point at others.
We went into the red last year.
I was surprised by his perseverance.
A young person wants to see you.
He felt his heart beating fast.
Are you young?
Please send this by registered mail.
Where's everybody else?
You're starting to sound like your old man.
I thought you were injured.
Are you sure you want to put your life in her hands?
About how much will I have to pay for all the treatments?
Tom, say something.
You're too old for me.
The wind calmed down.
I got fined.
What do you advise me to do?
There are no further details.
You almost died.
What department do you work for?
Have you measured it?
Don't let Tom frighten you.
Call an ambulance.
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Where will your party be?
The sooner, the better.
I know Tom will be supportive.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
He commanded me to leave the bedroom immediately.
What color are they?
Tom ate some spoiled food and became sick.
Wealthy older men often marry younger trophy wives.
I should have brought a lunch.
He ran the risk of having an accident.
What is it you want most?
I want to hear from you.

I want a boyfriend.
They relaxed on the beach.
You understand French, right?
I need a new broom. This one's shot.

They've suffered enough.
This might not be such a good idea.
I rushed out of my house.
The rumor is true to some extent.
The cat is sleeping.
The police have arrested someone.
I'm unhappy.
Do you believe me now?
I didn't realize you were awake.
Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
He doesn't like to eat fish.
Whose bicycle is this?
Tom forgot to tell us not to drink the tap water.
I'm glad to see you back.
They have a dream.
When did you build your house?
That's why I brought this.
I borrowed the dictionary from my friend.
Harajuku is one of the hottest places in Tokyo.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
We were all alone.
Tom doesn't want to wait that long.
Do you want to go?
The day will surely come when your dreams will come true.
Where can we talk privately?
She has never gone on a date with him.
I hated school.
Just do your job.

That's what Tom told me.
We're all friends.
I think I've forgotten something.
He lives in a posh apartment near Central Park.
He went out of the room.
I grew up in the country.
It's getting hard.
Tom seems so nice.
Are you dating anybody?
It's a personal matter.
Why are you yelling?
It'll break.
What would you do in my place?
We have a new student joining our class today.
How did you come up with that answer?
He keeps all his savings in the bank.

I didn't understand anything, either.
Do you have dinner plans?
I knew it would be an adventure.
I know that I do not know.
I'm not hitting on you.
These are not words.
He has a fear that his brother will fail.
It would be a pity to let all our hard work go to waste.
Why can't you do it?
I couldn't find anybody.
I'm so tired!
He is at the office.
What should I look for?
How do you feel about the war?
She gave a vague answer.
We must continue to study as long as we live.
My father failed in business.
Spring is coming.
I wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression about me.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
Don't be sad.
That will not change.
Do you have a menu in English?
I'm definitely impressed.
Be punctual.
What do I get in return?
All the songs I sang for you today were written by me.
Tell me what you have in your hand.
Everyone was invited, except for me.
I'll be back in an hour.
How deep are the cuts?
Could I see you tonight?

This is all a conspiracy.

He's not all there.
I think nobody's home.
His reply was negative.
We have no complaints.
Nobody knows it but me.
We remained silent.
It's not supposed to happen.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
I'm not at all tired.
Everyone knows what happened next.
She didn't even try to do the right thing.
Look at her putting on airs over there.

She has never been asked out on a date.
Everybody was silent.
It's better than doing nothing.
Tell me your impression of this book.
I totally agree with you.
My car, which broke down yesterday, has not been repaired yet.
My son can't count yet.
I'd be happy to discuss it.
Tom buttoned his coat.
Will you go, too?
What a pleasant surprise!
It was really just a misunderstanding.
What's the problem anyway?
Shut the door, please.
Why are you bleeding?
What have you done with your car?
What's his name?
The ice is too thin to bear your weight.
It's going to get quite hot today.
I'm in fair shape.

The man charged me with being irresponsible.
Are you a morning person?
Is somebody there?
Please have a seat and wait until your name is called.
I missed the last train, so I had to walk all the way home.
You're a star.
Everyone seems to agree.
I'd really rather be alone right now.
Has Tom calmed down?
I read five different magazines each month.
I've always considered you a close friend.
You said you wanted the truth.
I had no idea you felt that way.
Take as much time as you want.
Are you going to sit with me?

Let bygones be bygones.
I don't need it now.
Phew! That was close!
I don't have time to help now.
Stay close.

That sounds like a great idea.
I read it in some book.
He carried out his plan.
You're very stylish.

Light the candles.
Have a nice day.

That might help.
What I say is true.
This park is famous for its roses.
Who broke the cup?
He took the wrong train by mistake.

It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.

How could you do that?

Where's the nearest supermarket?

Tom took the job.
Don't make abrupt moves.
How lucky you are!
I don't want you to quit because of me.
Come alone.
I'm the one who should be doing that.

I'm able to run.
It used to be nearly impossible.
I think we should talk.
Do you recognize them?
Keep away from me.
Is that all we need?
Don't believe everything you hear.
I kid you not.
Here's what I think.
I'm still single.
It was Saturday night.
Shut your filthy mouth.
What should I bring?
I am very surprised that she became a Diet member.
His car was stuck in knee-deep snow.
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
I don't know whether the story is true or not.
Tom doesn't know anything about it.
I'll be right behind you.
She knows what to do now.
I just want to be prepared.
He was very kind to them.
She was the first one to help him.
Try to get a good night's sleep.
I'll tell you.
I'll leave that up to you.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
Let's ask a travel agent.
Is that why they died?
She's neither rich nor famous.
There is no other way.
If I could be that guy instead of me.
You look happy.
We're not your enemy.
I used to live near a park.
Will you sell me your house?
Books are for people who wish they were somewhere else.
The papers didn't print this story.
Show us what you've got.
He's got lung cancer.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
I must go alone.
Have a drink with me.
Where's your drink?
You shouldn't read people's private letters without permission.
What're you drinking?
I'm a bit drunk.
It must weigh about thirty kilograms.
We're ready for this.
Won't you have some tea?
I'm not talking to you, Tom.
You don't have to hurry.
Let's not stay here long.
The police continued their investigation.
This is the place I told Tom about.
We expect rain today.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
Bring me my glasses.
Does it hurt when you chew?
I gave him what money I had.
Tom got lost on his way here.
He has the least money of us all.
Do you understand or not?
The girl did not say anything.
Please wait here for a while.
Tom is here, right?
He raised his arm.
I fear for the future of mankind.
Don't tell me to relax.
What's the fare to Liverpool?
Are you over your cold yet?
I don't feel comfortable posing in the nude.
I think there's been a mistake.
You can trust us.
The station is a ten minute drive from here.
Could you take our picture?
Walk ahead of me.
I'll buy this desk for him.
I think you should swim.
I'm already in trouble.
I thought Tom and Mary were married to each other.
He fell in love with a younger woman.
I wish you had come with us.
She couldn't come because he was sick.
Many people have made the same mistake.
They have already finished the work.
I don't do that as often as I'd like to.
It needs washing.
I have the feeling that my French is improving.
Speak quietly.
We do this every Monday.
We can't do this without you.
She tried to persuade him not to decline the offer.
This dictionary is expensive.
I used to go ice fishing when I was younger.
Do you like robots?
Did you watch the game?
This is a very nice house.
This kind of specialized knowledge has very little to do with daily life.
Have you even heard a word I've said?
Is it a disgrace to be divorced with children?
They set fire to their neighbour's house in revenge.
I'm shy.
I felt like my life was over.
Going to this school requires a lot of money.
Who forced you to do that?
I thought you wanted to wait.
Tom has a bright career as a medical doctor.
She's not prettier than her mother.
They'll tell you the truth.
She will return within an hour.
He remains sick in bed.
I hurried so I wouldn't miss the train.
I'm reformed.
The contract expires next year.
Why don't you give me a break?
Just a few days ago, we were so happy.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
My best friend is in Rome now.
He went ballistic.
I guess I should be going.
Look, I want you to do me a favor.
It's a pretty smart decision.
Who's taking responsibility for this problem?
The parents succeeded in calming him down.
What have you done with my bag?
I don't feel comfortable posing in the nude.
I have to go soon because I left the engine running.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
I have never met a person like him.
I meant you no harm.
Can you give me an example?
You've always got to be ready for an emergency.
Do you have any light beer?
Tom raised his son on his own.
She got married when she was twenty-five.
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
She is beginning to play the piano.
Stop showing off!
If that's true, then she's better than me.
While I was waiting for the bus, I saw a traffic accident.
Can you tell me who they are?
Do you like my new haircut?
How was the weather yesterday?
Don't sit on that bench.
Tom is a Boston native.
We welcome you to our club.
Your idea sounds like a good one.
A new team was formed in order to take part in the boat race.
I never thought about it before.
Tom will do that for free.
He stole a kiss from her.
Why are these photos so important?
I can't figure out what's causing the problem.
Some men don’t know that.
You can make your own.
How do you know which one is yours?
But I was careful.
Which book do you need?
Tom tried to push Mary into the water.
I'm kind of happy.
Due to the worsening weather, the departure was delayed.
We love our customers.
I called her office, but no one answered.
She explained to him why she was late.
I'll give you a lift home.
I dreamed I was in Boston again.
Which one's the new one?
Mary is Tom's cousin.
It used to be that people thought it was necessary to eat three square meals a day.
It's conceivable.
I'm not worried about them.
You almost convinced me to do that.
I couldn't let you do that.
I've already said no.
I'm calling to report a lost wallet.
His brave action is worthy of a medal.
It's possible that he came here when he was young.
The girl caught a small fish.
I saw Tom kissing John's wife.
Murder is against the law.
Do you have earrings on?
Tom is going to have to verify this.
He said that he had met her on the previous day.
I dislike all of them.
Tom is scared of ghosts.
My lawyer is on his way.
Everybody is alive.
I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
I have no idea how long I was unconscious.
Thirteen Americans were killed.
I had to get away from here.
I know you must be afraid.
You've been selected.
I'm glad you came over.
Tom is trying to learn French.
She was advised by him to go abroad while she was still young.
What are you up to?
Put your hat back on.
I planted some potatoes this week.
The cabin smelled musty.
It's a rough neighborhood.
How can you be so sure?
She put on socks.
Can I write it like that?
I don't know how we did it.
I think this belongs to you.
Do you want to stay here all night?
Let's walk to the bookstore.
I wonder what that means.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his keys.
He hurried on to make up for lost time.
Don't push me.
The motor stopped.
I thought it would be fun.
How was your night?
Some people like red wine and some people like white wine.
What do you say to taking a rest?
The world is full of fools.
If you see Tom, please tell him for me.
Does anyone have a match?
This is expensive.
Tom doesn't have any money on him.
Fishing is fun.
I'm never gonna let her live that down.
He was the first man to cross the Pacific.
Open the door.
I always have room for dessert.
He succeeded to his uncle's fortune.
I thought I'd lost you.
This is ugly.
Tom and Mary usually speak to each other in French.
Let go of my arm!
I didn't mean to pry.
Hurry up, girls.
Tom had every right to be angry.
You're the best singer I know.
Let's go outside and eat.
How come I've never seen you here before?
It's important that you tell the truth.
And then, what did you do?
That's a lot of cash.
I just wanted to be popular.
If I were the boss, I'd fire you.
Do you want me to call back?
I can't say I'm sorry.
Your sister cannot swim well, can she?
Are you sure you did everything you were supposed to do?
That was my goal.
I eat there every night.
Just as the Americans like baseball, the British like cricket.
Let's rest a little bit.
Was the victim male or female?
He doesn't look himself this morning.
The police are looking into it.
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
I want to ask you a question.
How are you going?
We can't compromise on this.
This text isn't easy to translate.
I don't have a curfew.
Why did you kill the snake?
I don't want to rest.
This mine will close down next month.
Do you like your hot chocolate?
Nothing could stop him.
I can't wait to leave.
Tom wanted Mary to sing his favorite song.
I came to wish you good luck.
You make it sound very simple.
I love men with beards.
You don't want to tell me why, do you?
She was ill for a long time.
I tried to protect you.
Aren't you sick of eating here?
She is often mistaken for her sister.
I wouldn't want to miss your concert.
We found Tom drunk sleeping on a park bench.
I'm a changed man.
It's still too early to get up.
Tom has a rabbit.
Are you listening to the radio?
He wondered how many times the sun would rise before his salary would.
I built this for you.
What kind of mistakes did you make?
She is about as tall as me.
Does anyone have an antidote?
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
I'm parked around the corner.
I'm not going to sell it.
I'm saving money for a car.
I'll study your report.
There's a book about dancing on the desk.
The proof is in the pudding.
How do you pronounce this?
The negotiations have ended.
I know you're not serious.
I know his address, but it's a secret.
I love you the best of all.
Tom has finished reading the book that Mary gave him yesterday.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I want to see what I'm up against.
He robbed me blind.
It's 8:30.
I need to know if you are planning to come.
Why should I tell the truth if you won't?
My hands and legs are swollen.
Tom remembered everything.
Tom patted me on the back and congratulated me.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
Tom felt ill at ease.
I am going to bed.
None of the rooms is ready.
Make your move.
Don't open this box.
You people are amazing.
I thought your dad took away your credit card.
I think I've made a big mistake.
We ate the pizza.
He didn't protest.
Are you alone?
I don't get much mail.
There's a movie I want to watch on TV tomorrow night.
I'm at work now.
When does the plane leave?
Why wouldn't we do that?
All your problems have been solved.
It was a big explosion.
The meeting was held here.
What does this machine do?
I think it's time for me to admit that I never cared about you.
Don't tell anyone about this.
I like music.
Can we at least sit down?
I'm glad no one got hurt.
That's the absolute truth.
I don't feel very confident.
I don't think they heard us.
I've heard that song before.
Let me treat you next time, then.
I'll call the chef.
He kept his word.
They all looked happy.
Why does Tom want a horse?
My uncle isn't young, but he's healthy.
I saw the file.
I was unable to stand any longer.
I thought it'd be fun to surprise Tom.
Time flies like an arrow.
My parents made me go there.
I know you must be afraid.
Hold the door.
We began on a new project.
You're unusually quiet today.
Oceans do not so much divide the world as unite it.
Is this true?
Tom doesn't hear very well.
What a funny man!
You owe me big time.
Are you honest?
Rinse with warm water.
Everyone fell asleep.
New blankets were distributed to the poor.
You're the one who decided to do this job, right?
Cut that out!
I went there yesterday.
Please let me know if it hurts.
I feel normal.
I know Tom is a scoundrel.
He has a sense of humor.
I agree with you one hundred percent.
You hurt my feelings.
What do you usually eat for lunch?
This tape isn't sticky.
Can I use your pencil?
You guys are awesome.
They don't have to go to school today.
I'm turning the light off.
You'd better start now.
You've got to be bold!
That's the stupidest thing you've ever done.
This book has many pictures.
Don't be naive.
I can't win.
Thank you. We'll do our best.
Can you give me another example?
I had to catch the first train this morning in order to get here in time.
I'm learning so much from you.
I wasn't joking.
Children often try to imitate their elders.
I can open the window.
He doesn't have a family.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I hope that this isn't a mistake.
Were you conscientious?
Does this look familiar to you?
Please tell me about it.
Were you happy?
Nothing has been heard from him since he left for America.
I'm waiting for my mother.
He greeted his parents.
No matter what he does, he does it well.
Tom is now in jail.
Will you glance through this report?
Do you want a massage?
We depend on each other.
There were two cakes.
Does she have a hobby?
Her nails are red.
She regretted that she had not followed his advice.
I don't date.
Your o's look like a's.
Keep out of my way.
You're not a loser.
We ought to win.
A good lawyer would leave no stone unturned in his efforts to defend his client.
They stated their objections.
No matter where I go, I get lost.
I can touch the ceiling.
I had to do my duty.
I'm waiting for a phone call.
He is inclined to argue at great length.
We caught you.
He finally bent to my wishes.
I had no place else to go.
We complained that the room was cold.
You shouldn't talk about people behind their backs.
You've got a vivid imagination!
I just don't want to overdo it.
Tom started yelling.
I'm all for that.
Where did you go?
I'll finish it in two or three minutes.
We know you're interested.
They will tear down the old building in two days.
The train was ten minutes behind time.
I'd like your permission to use it.
Can we forget that this just happened?
Don't exceed the speed limit.
Are you closer to your mother or to your father?
You could at least try to be a bit more polite, even though it's not like you.
I feel like celebrating.
I could probably convince Tom not to do that.
Tom parked his car behind the building.
What do you like about her?
I do not mind what people say.
I'm still sleepy.
Tom was dressed in black.
He wears pajamas.
They are very cheerful.
Her vanity knows no bounds.
Have you solved all the problems yet?
They weren't invited.
Can you lend me your bicycle?
We have enough data.
Today you can get two for the price of one.
I asked what was wrong.
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
I bowed politely.
Tom has a lot of pictures of Mary.
He showed me a lot of beautiful photos.
His long speech bored everyone.
You're going to have to call Tom.
What time do you usually get up?
I had a busy afternoon.
She will get well soon.
Could I have another glass of beer?
Tom should be ready by now.
You're the only Canadian I know.
Are there kids?
How's your wife?
Tom and Mary aren't coming.
Look at that!
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
I like long stories with surprise endings.
We danced all night long.
He’s shivering because of the cold.
She showed me his album.
They were cousins.
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
He was a bit embarrassed.
You have so much potential.
I think Tom will be OK.
Work on the assignment in small groups.
Everybody knew she could speak English well.
Did you lie to your parents?
I saw you there.
I don't believe he is a lawyer.
Please put on your shoes.
I've been thinking about it.
He was charged with conspiracy.
I suggest you not talk so loud.
It's not pretty.
I can do it with one hand.
Music is the universal language.
A rainbow is a natural phenomenon.
Ten years have passed since he died.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
I didn't expect you so soon.
I know how you must be feeling.
How much did they give you for your old car?
If only I hadn't been in such a hurry!
This is my I.D. card.
Don't judge people by appearance.
Don't miss the bus.
Could you please kiss a little bit more slowly?
You are no longer welcome here.
I used to dream about being able to breathe underwater.
Did you finish your paper?
Tom's leg is bleeding.
Would you like to have some tea?
There are some things money can't buy.
If someone who doesn't know your background says that you sound like a native speaker, it means they probably noticed something about your speaking that made them realize you weren't a native speaker. In other words, you don't really sound like a native speaker.
I'm really bad with names, but I never forget a face.
This is the culmination of years of work.
I don't know why you didn't tell the truth.
Don't use his real name.
And then something amazing happened.
We're on our own.
You should try to live within your means.
You never cease to amaze me.
A fund was launched to set up a monument in memory of the dead man.
I have a friend who lives in Tokyo.
My house is five blocks away.
Tom isn't wearing his new coat.
I'll call you in the morning.
You didn't tell me everything.
You may sit.
Where was this picture taken?
What's our plan?
We're very busy.
I thought I told you not to do that in here.
That's a waste of time and money.
Tom is too young to drink beer.
You've never been happy.
I didn't really think it would happen.
I really owe you an apology.
I'm taking a walk in a park.
You did a good thing.
She went to see him in the hospital every day.
They are making a salad.
Does it offend you?
I know that's not what you want.
I tried not to cry in front of him.
Don't be upset.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
I can't find my luggage.
She's going to have a baby.
The property was divided equally among the heirs.
The Coliseum was the former arena in ancient Rome.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
Tom told me he wanted to cry.
I think you're jealous.
The cops are gone.
I have to get home before it gets dark.
You have only to give him a little help.
Keep going straight.
We could all be dead tomorrow.
The poem's rhyme scheme is highly complex.
I'll go see if Tom is here.
I feel bad about that.
I don't feel very good.
He and I are cousins.
Can you just give me a minute?
The day started off very well.
I kept him company while his wife was in surgery.
I assume your mission was a success.
I want to know what you know.
He seems satisfied with my explanation.
We are in a difficult situation.
I was young and innocent.
I want you back today.
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
I don't believe this is true.
I'm not so tired.
They don't care.
Don't tell me you can't read.
I think you did it.
I know you feel sad.
Are you comfortable?
You won't die today.
I owe what I am today to my uncle.
Is this love?
Try to make the most of every opportunity.
Do you want a ticket?
Now give me the list.
The meeting broke up at nine o'clock.
Why are you so arrogant?
I'm buying a puppy.
I know Tom is a coal miner.
She is out now.
My father often falls asleep while watching television.
You're the teacher.
It's settled then.
Don't hide under the bed.
My nose is bleeding.
How long will the flight time be?
He affirmed that he saw the crash.
Do you have someplace to stay?
Are you ready for the trip?
I'm still hungry.
Don't act like a know-it-all.
Tom finished his meal first.
Could you please talk a bit louder? I can't hear very well.
It's better to walk back than to get lost.
We were all happy.
Tom is my brother's friend.
What you're doing is unforgivable.
As far as I know, he has never been overseas.
I just want to be a little happier.
Don't step on my toes.
He had to leave the village.
Wait here until I come back.
What do you need?
What would get their attention?
This dictionary has been of great use to me.
Have you ever cheated on an exam?
You're going too fast.
Last night, we heard sounds of gunshots and screaming on the street outside our window.
Tom speaks French fluently.
He is studying at his desk.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand.
The clouds are getting darker.
Don't close the door.
It's already time to leave.
Can I speak to you?
Tom found the hat Mary was looking for in the basement.
He is very eager to go there.
Did you tell Tom why you're here?
Could you give me some advice?
Will you show me the way to the bank?
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
I think you might be overreacting.
I don't feel like watching TV.
How did you get Tom to help you?
Do you have any cash?
The day we arrived was a holiday.
I'd like to know how you got my phone number.
You're not late.
We need to add some statistics to the PowerPoint.
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
Your services are no longer required.
We count on you.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
The rumor was not based on facts.
The guitar is so expensive that I can't afford it.
Did the phone wake you?
You go first.
Turn the knob and open the door.
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
I'm not as old as you, of course.
When did you get back from Boston?
I can't believe this is happening.
He is very clever for a boy of ten.
Tom isn't a good dog trainer.
I like Japanese food.
Today I don't feel like doing anything.
He sometimes is absent from work without good cause.
He will be in time for the train.
There were no consequences.
I think you should take vitamins.
How do you do this?
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
Try to remain calm.
Tom wants another slice of watermelon.
Does this skirt suit me?
I let you down.
What song is this?
You have to go.
I'm hardworking.
I haven't seen much of him recently.
I wonder what Tom sees in Mary.
Bring me some water.
I always knew you'd be back.
Tom was the first boy to hug Mary.
I don't like to eat fish with many bones.
We've all got ears.
How did you get these?
I'm thankful for vacations.
She is hard on them.
I'm enjoying this warm weather.
He likes money.
I like hanging out here.
Calm down.
I ought to have made a hotel reservation earlier.
He is lying on the sofa.
The pond is very deep.
Go slow.
Do you love your mother?
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
Add the vanilla extract.
Over one hundred people came here.
I don't watch a lot of movies, but I can't resist a good documentary.
He was beaten too easily.
I lost that argument.
Tom doesn't like cheese.
It's in times like these that the character of a person becomes apparent.
Tom doesn't know how computers work.
I was very, very lucky.
I'm not in the mood for jokes.
If you want to, we'll go.
Why didn't you come?
He has a very good sense of humor.
We are sorry we can't help you.
I need to know.
He made reference to my book.
They spent the night on the beach.
You're silly.
How was your trip to Boston?
She's a glamorous girl.
Can I count on you?
Contact me if you have any questions.
He wants to be a tennis player.
Do you want in or not?
I've already filed my report.
I'm sure I turned off the gas.
Actually, I'm not quite sure.
You're one of them, aren't you?
Cut it out.
People should wash themselves.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
This didn't cost anything.
Tom is exactly like us.
Tom is no longer doing that.
I have a little money with me.
Tom fell in love with Mary.
It was disgusting.
Playing tennis is fun.
I'll allow you to go.
Tom couldn't stop laughing.
Why are you picking a fight with me?
Tom is a little nervous.
We ran down the hill.
How much time did you spend doing research before you started writing?
I am yours and you are mine.
Why are you scared of me?
Can I be excused?
Tom could help you.
Which one do you prefer, the red one or the blue one?
I want life to be the way it was before.
You won't have to take charge of that.
As a result of a traffic jam, he wasn't able to see her off at the station.
We started to walk.
I forgot something.
He worked far into the night.
I see how you did that.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
Is it OK if I hug you?
Were you conscientious?
Don't ask me to explain it.
I made a fortune.
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
I asked Tom for some help.
What I really want to do is sleep.
She made a bet with him.
Do you think in French?
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We're getting a new car next month.
I ran the risk of losing my job to help her.
Are you still upset about what happened?
He has fallen in love with me.
She divorced him after many years of unhappiness.
They sat on a bench in the park.
Would you like something to drink?
Please don't do it.
It is going to be rather cool.
We exchanged greetings.
Let's go to a store with lower prices.
I love baking.
I'm delighted to be here.
I told you I hated that shirt.
I always wondered what was in your attic.
Tom didn't look offended.
I love how you think of other people's needs before your own.
He forgot that he bought her a present.
I was last.
My room is very small.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go there.
The long trip aggravated her injury.
Thank you for your advice.
This word comes from Greek.
Let me take that.
I found this bottle when I was walking on the beach this morning.
I can survive.
I'm letting you go.
Tom and Mary studied together.
We are prone to judge every one by ourselves.
I just want to die.
Find Tom before he tells someone.
What's this really about?
It's not your fault.
I'm just a poor student.
Finally she gave in to temptation and ate the whole cake.
Tom searched the room.
I think you did that intentionally.
Has Tom ever done your homework for you?
Give me your keys.
That hurts.
That's a clever idea.
The rest will be easy.
I love him, but he loves someone else.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
Tom gave Mary a box of assorted chocolates.
It glows in the dark.
I just got a raise.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
Isn't that what you're trying to tell me?
How many words should you write?
It's incredible!
The Olympic Games are held every four years.
Tom is fishing for trout about a hundred meters downstream from here.
It is no use arguing with him.
You need to focus on your strengths.
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

I don't need anyone anymore.
I really want to thank you.
He did not listen.
Tom must do it now.
Do you have any kind of alibi?
I overslept again.
Don't believe anything they say.
Tell Tom that I need his help.
I understand your feelings.

Here he is!
Her name slipped my mind.
He speaks English better than me.

I can't believe I listened to you.
The plane crashed.
Living conditions were hard.
I don't like Christmas anymore.
I think that Tom told you the truth.
I didn't sign up for this.
Thanks for singing the song I requested.
You're cantankerous.
This ticket entitles you to a free meal.
Raise up your left hand.

I was detained.
Tom hid behind a bush.
Can you believe this is already happening?
I appreciate all you've done for me.
I thought you'd ask that.
What's your area of specialization?
I'm much younger than you.

Our negotiations broke off.
Tom is only five, but he already knows how to read.
She watched him continue to fight as hard as he could.
What have you come up with?
Tom turned down the heat.
How much money does he have?
To tell the truth, I don't agree with you.
You work too much.
Do you think you can help Tom?
Would you mind going over that again?
Tom is a wonderful dancer.
What are you doing here?
My brother loves taking pictures of mountains.
It is a lot of fun to drive a car.
They're waiting for us.
How much did it cost?
I know Tom is a pharmacist.
He dumped me.
I wonder what's wrong with the car.
It's on the sofa.
Are you ready to leave?
I think they did it on purpose.
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
Twelve people have walked on the moon.
I know who did it.
What Tom said made you angry, didn't it?
There are times when I'd like to be more like you.
I'll give that a try.
Don't hurt anyone.
We're so glad to have you here.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
What did Tom do wrong?
Have you ever been to Africa?
Do you have professional experience?
I didn't graduate.
One of her three cars is blue and the others are white.
I'd like to have you on our team.

I don't want to deal with this problem now.
You're very attractive.
The players on this team are all giants.
I'm too tired to think.
He wondered why she did that.
Did Tom drown?
Take anything you want.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I want to start over.
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
He went out the window.
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
I'd like to see you again.
Are you sure you know what to do?
I watch the news every evening.
The pain has mostly gone away.
Those pens are mine.
Let's take a picture.
I had my ears checked.
He hurt his hand when he fell.
Is this a date?
You've got to be kidding me!
How old are you now?
It often snows here.
He hasn't written the letter yet.
Where is it? I've been searching for hours.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
You need to be more aggressive.
Tell me how to do this.
It was a judgment call.
Can I go now?
Tom told Mary not to worry.
I don't think Tom is listening to me.
His overcoat is worn out.
She finally managed to get a hold of her old friend.
It's hot today, isn't it?
Some people are still worried.
You should probably go, Tom.
I did that in school.
Old people need something to live for.
Did that hotel meet your expectations?
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
They don't listen to me.
Since he had a bad cold, he was absent from school today.
Tom can't see us.
Where were you yesterday?
They need to change their mindset.
How many people were killed in the accident?
Do I really have to give a speech?

Wait a sec.
There's nothing more I can do.
You're working hard.
Watch your language.
I should've never walked so much in a new pair of shoes.
We're reading.
He isn't back from the mountain.
We make great money.
I'll get you some brandy.
She has long hair.
I'm still undecided.
I'm too old for Tom.
He attended the meeting as our company representative.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
I fixed myself something to eat.
You cooked the steak just the way I like it.
We work to earn money.
I need a keyboard.
She and I have been married 30 years.
I did what I wanted to do.
Something bit me.
Does this not please you?
Please sign here.
You can read this book.
It's not right.
He did it in front of the staff.
You're assertive.
I hated that movie.
He was curious about how it would taste, so he took a small bite.
Which is the most difficult language in the world?
His way of thinking is very childish.
I'm going to run a couple of errands. Wanna tag along?
I could use a little sympathy.
I guess I'm going to have to learn French.
Respect your elders.
We're not really asking for money.
Do we have a deal here?
You need to get some rest.
I assumed that she was there.
Tom doesn't still do that.
Every time I read the Bible, I am deeply moved.
The income from this source is tax-free.
The architecture in this part of the city is ugly.
You'd be perfect for that.
He keeps his youth by jogging.
I persuaded him to go to the party.
I've already told Tom I won't help him.
An investigation is ongoing.
She's putting the children to bed.
I don't think you should eat that.
He owns a dishwasher.
You're the master.
I just thought that you wouldn't want to go.
I don't know her address.
The food is horrible.
If Cleopatra's nose had been shorter, the whole face of the world would have been changed.
I went to the hospital.
I'll always love you, no matter what happens.
I will look it up in the dictionary.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
Tom doesn't even live in Boston.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
The situation is worse than we believed.
Mother is in bed. She caught a cold.
Where did all the bread go?
It's your duty to finish the job.
I'd like to know the truth.
A few glasses of wine can loosen the tongue.
I want to study abroad.
Boxers need quick reflexes.
Don't blame me for this.
We don't have a reservation.
So, how does it feel to be a father?
He couldn't hold his temper any longer.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't like Mary.
The well ran dry.
He thinks he is somebody, but really he is nobody.
What was it that he was looking for?
The box is made of wood.
Don't take it to heart.
You're not my type.
The orange left a strange taste in my mouth.
Do you need a ride?
All of us were excited with the result of the experiment.
I could help.
I can't tell you what I think.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
Please choose a stronger password.
The girls won.
Where are you hurt?
A child needs love.
He's in danger of being evicted.
Take care and have a nice day.
He gathered up his things and left.
It's the house specialty.
An uncle of mine is a doctor.
That's not fair and you know it.
I called earlier.
Good afternoon. You are our new neighbor, if I'm not mistaken?
I lit the candle.
You should be real proud of yourself.
Are you for or against the proposal?
Sorry about the mess.
Where did you go last Sunday?
We elected him mayor.
I'm thorough.
We wasted a lot of time looking for Tom.
They'll take care of Tom.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
He lives within his means.
I have a request.
The elevator seems to be out of order.
I guess you didn't quite understand me.
She is more of an acquaintance than a friend.
She sleeps with two pillows.
You know what might happen, don't you?
They kept their love a secret.
Get into the car.
I lost a bunch of keys.
I can't give up now.
How do I open the hood?
I spilled the milk.
I'll call him.
You're on the wrong road.
Everybody already knew that.
He's leaning on a cane.
Few people have typewriters.
How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital?
What a beautiful baby!
Did you know him well?
It is hardly raining.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
You look pale.
Have you been abroad?
I appreciate your patience.
It's not always like that.
This armchair is comfortable to sit in.
We must not complain.
Who are your parents?
Hang on a bit until I'm ready.
I've done the best I could to help you. The rest is up to you.
Never tell anyone.
It's redundant.
That dress is perfect for you.
He'll become a good husband.
We have to put off the game till next Sunday.
What makes you happy?
Don't look so shocked.
I tried on the shoes.
I'm near the station.
Give that back to me.
I would like to see Tom once more.
Why were you absent yesterday?
I suppose you've got a point.
How far is it from here to the sea?
That's true.
Stop!
She set a new world record.
If anything happens here, can I depend on you?
I want you to have my land after I die.
I heard yelling.
What do you like?
I didn't know there was a pond here.
Why didn't you come to the party?
It is doubtful whether this method will work.
I didn't buy the car.
Here, catch!
This lake is very deep.
Did you enjoy yourself?
I knew then that I was right.
Mary's hair is naturally curly.
He told me that he would visit Nara next month.
Tom comes from a small town.
I couldn't have said it better.
They all burst out laughing.
This job pays pretty well.
The girl who works at the bakery is pretty.
Cocaine is a drug.
I would like a tourist visa.
Tom is still alive.
I brought wine.
Why are you protesting against the government?
Please be quiet, everybody.
I sat down next to him.
Would you care for more coffee?
I intended to go straight back home, but I sort of wandered inside a bookstore.
Will you please put the baby to bed?
I want an MP3 player!
I'll look after your child while you are away.
Do you know all these people?
I've already rescheduled my appointment twice.
I'll kill it.
He caught me by the hand.
This is nonsense.
You're a jolly good feller.
Is this seat reserved?
Tom has been absent from school for three days.
I don't even have one.
I don't have all night.
Recreational drug use inspires many urban legends.
I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully.
I lit the match.
It was made to look like an accident.
I'm assuming you have a plan.
My computer stopped working a few days ago.
Tom has written many magazine articles on whales.
I hope you agree.
Tom was going to help us.
Tom offered Mary a slice of cake.
Could you give me a discount?
I'll buy the tickets.
I don't hear barking.
Is that so terrible?
I was completely devastated.
I was caught in a shower and got drenched to the skin.
Yesterday, I read a really interesting story.
I can't wait any more.
He complained to her about the food.
Don't tell anyone we've done this.
He is lost in thought.
You seem very nervous this morning.
I think you did the right thing.
You're wasting your time.
I had to keep my secret.
This isn't so difficult.
You should take an umbrella with you this morning.
How many were there altogether?
They handled it well.
I'm well.
He did it again.
There's an emergency situation.
You should've gotten up earlier.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
We're getting tired.
They all laughed at their error.
You're not as young as you used to be.
I can do it by myself!
Happy is a man who marries a good wife.
Hey, what was that all about?
He turned pale when he heard that news.
May I try it on?
This coat is nice, but too expensive.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I was meaning to call you.
Tom should pay what he owes.
Who's taking responsibility for the loss?
Do you have laundry service?
The boats collided head on.
He was exhausted when he got home.
I admit I was surprised.
I spilled my drink.
I'm too busy to help her.
Tom always keeps a set of jumper cables in the trunk of his car.
It's what you deserve.
He lost his eyesight in an accident.
I used to be the same age as you.
Come back in a day.
Many men died at sea.
Tom was a crusader.
How much longer do you think it'll be until it starts raining?
She demanded to see the manager.
You're scared of being hurt, aren't you?
Should we worry?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
What can you say?
Who else knows I'm here?
I didn't know Tom could play the trombone so well.
The mail train lost most of its mail in the fire.
He did the reverse of what I asked.
He is handsome and clever.
Tom is really acting strange.
He is a rude person.
I'm sure that Tom is honest.
I've had enough of this.
Would you like me to go there with you?
I got up early, so that I could catch the first train.
We were crowded into the small room.
Who doesn't care about money?
Tom has some homework to do.
I want to go over a few things with you.
Why doesn't he tell them?
This company uses cheap labor to increase its profit margins.
Tom's jokes are hilarious and get even better after he's had a few beers.
Do you have change for a dollar?
I always take some exercise before breakfast.
Everyone here knows everyone else.
I can't believe I'm still alive.
Stop talking like that.
I know this house used to be yours.
Could you please tell me who you are?
Can you stay for a while?
I've hired an attorney.
Do you think it'll fit?
We'll do it together.
I'm glad you liked my friends.
How come you're not the boss?
I watch TV off and on.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
Everybody was disguised, so I couldn't tell who was who.
Tom gave me money.
Tom can't help us anymore.
Tom has to go back to Australia.
Everyone has a right to live.
That's absolute nonsense!
If you want to sell your old sofa, why not put an advertisement in the local paper?
Is he your teacher?
Don't confuse astrology with astronomy.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
Do you remember seeing me before?
The leaders were out of touch with the people.
A true friendship is more valuable than money.
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
My friend is bilingual.
He comes into contact with all kinds of people.
The novel ends with the heroine's death.
Where would you like to live?
Have you heard the news yet?
Have you ever heard such a story?
How can I get my toddler to eat vegetables?
I love summer rain.
It's not that long a flight.
She drives me mad.
That was a close call.
A GPS device can pinpoint your location anywhere in the world.
It's my turn.
I love her and she loves me.
I don't need a haircut.
We don't want to give too much away.
I got arrested.
When did you say that?
How did you know that Tom's passport was in the bottom drawer?
Policemen aren't permitted to drink on duty.
How long did you stay in Boston?
She stood as close to him as she could.
I just want to be a good person.
It's very easy to sound natural in your own native language, and very easy to sound unnatural in your non-native language.
He studied the way birds fly.
Tom cursed.
I get up at six every morning.
Nobody can replace Tom.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm afraid I have work to do.
I've decided to go a little further.
She tied him up.
There's no stopping now.
You don't know how much I wanted to do that.
I'm on your side.
It's pretty new.
Don't you want to have another child?
The desk is covered with dust.
I want to see for myself.
Will you join our club?
I thought I heard you.
I know your roommate.
She was killed in an automobile accident.
Put your pants on.
I asked for my father's help.
My eyes feel gritty.
She's worried about your safety.
The food didn't look very appetizing.
It was just a passing infatuation.
She blamed him for all her problems.
That's much more important.
She is not quite content.
I can't help but feel like I've forgotten something.
We want further information.
I forgot to tell you my phone number.
Do you mean you're giving up?
I'm eating a pear.
What are your plans for tonight?
The dove is a symbol of peace.
His birthday is May 5th.
Are you still playing golf?
Tom is the man of my dreams.
What time is dinner served?
There's a good chance that he'll be chosen.
I finally have time to reply to the mail that I have received these past three weeks.
It's supposed to snow tomorrow.
I made a decision.
He's obsessed with cleanliness.
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
Their marriage broke up last year.
A prolonged silence followed.
It's for the children.
He hurried in order to get the bus.
You ought not to miss it.
He made me a cake.
I'll permit you to go.
Give me a bottle of wine.
The cliff is almost vertical.
Is Tom working?
I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I think that what you need now is a kiss.
I can't believe how beautiful you are.
They do it faster than me.
Tom's bedroom door was closed.
There were ten eggs in all.
I don't want to hear that word.
Can you solve this problem?
They hid in the cellar.
Have you given any thought to having dinner with me?
If you are a parent, don't allow yourself to set your heart on any particular line of work for your children.
She committed a crime.
We've only been together three months.
What's all that racket?
Everyone is silent.
We'll pay for this later.
Can anyone answer my question?
What's got into you?
Tom is likely to be early.
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
I need a good pair of sunglasses.
We went to Boston, where we stayed a week.
I just don't want your dog in my house.
I want to write this down.
You're shy.
I'm feeling fine now.
I'm about the same age as you.
Words hurt more than fists.
Why do you want to know what we are thinking about?
She bought a toy for the kid.
There is an urgent need for good legal advice.
She tends to be late for school.
That has happened to me several times.
I've gotten better.
May I go with you?
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
Are we alone in the universe?
You played hooky yesterday?
I threw up.
You heard your mother.
Are you picking on me?
Please come this way.
I'm a coward.
It's as cold as ice.
He refused to take the bribe.
Don't get mad, promise.
Economy cars save you money.
The conference went according to plan.
What should I do?
IMF stands for International Monetary Fund.
Whoever stole the money should be punished.
You'd be perfect for that.
I see something moving.
The contest ends tomorrow.
Tom asked me to marry him.
You're so paranoid.
We'll have to postpone the meeting.
Tom knows who I am.
Tell me where you went.
My father loves doing some tinkering in the garage.
We're in trouble.
I'd like to make myself useful.
Do you need anything?
I can't do it without somebody's help.
We spent hours trying to solve the problem.
As is often the case with him, he was late again.
We didn't know which car we should get in.
It was very disappointing.
Tell me your story. I am all ears.
Tom wasn't too sure what to think.
There is no need for him to work.
I can't afford this one either.
They're cousins.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
Thanks for your report.
Without you, I would've died.
I like your legs.
Are there still some empty seats?
I'm back in business.
It's an interesting argument.
I like your glasses.
I just changed my mind. That's all.
I love spending time with you.
He runs a supermarket in the town.
Forget it!
This is the house where I lived when I was a child.
There's no need for you to prepare a formal speech.
You're in big trouble now.
How do I eat this?
Your behavior was disgraceful.
What were you doing in that cave?
I can't give up my dream.
Do you feel sick?
I like wearing old clothes.
I think Tom is unlucky.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
It's all wrong.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
We thought you could do it.
He has a huge ego.
Today is Independence Day.
They want you dead.
Tom is making a video.
There isn't any problem at all.
There is no advantage in doing that.
I had a lot of fun last weekend.
That is an absolute lie.
They lied.
Her house is very modern.
Nothing I did helped.
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
Don't be fooled by his good looks.
The girl had a large red hat on.
Turn on the fan.
She always takes care of her children.
I used to weigh seventy kilos.
I didn't see you.
The line is busy now.
I'm a happy man.
This is the best restaurant I know.
We left home early in the morning.
He lives somewhere around here.
Tom can't be over thirty. He looks like he's about eighteen.
I love Arabic.
It seems to me that he is honest.
Try to make the most of your time.
What do you do for a living?
He writes to me once in a while.
I found him lying on the bed.
His lecture started on time.
What exactly don't you get?
Help yourself.
I believe in him.
I shouldn't have to do that again.
Let me see it.
Don't lose sight of what you're here for.
We should all work together.
Any further discussion is pointless.
Who knew about this?
That's only my personal opinion.
Tom quickly realized that something was wrong.
That boy is intelligent.
Tom and Mary weren't impressed.
He came back home a while ago.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
I thought we were best friends.
She has to change clothes before tonight's party.
You don't look like a doctor.
I am looking for a present for my mother.
I said not now.
What's his name?
I'm going to miss you, too.
I wish I had a room of my own.
Tom is already sleeping.
I'm glad you asked that question.
This book is better than that one.
Tom was sitting on the couch alone.
That's the point I'm trying to make.
I got up early in order to catch the first train.
Please pass me the butter.
You're not normal.
It's me that went there yesterday.
Can I go to work?
Declawing cats is forbidden in the European Union.
I was the only one at the meeting who didn't think that was a good idea.
My youngest brother is still asleep.
It was fun while it lasted.
I don't want any problems.
Do you know the man that's staring at you?
All these books are mine.
Your glasses fell on the floor.
It would seem that you know something that I don't.
Are you responsible for this?
You're not the only Canadian here.
Tom is now taller than his father.
I must remind you about your promise.
I live three blocks away.
I don't recall saying that.
You're too young to remember the nineties.
What difference does it make?
I've been looking forward to this.
He's waiting for you at home.
He gets a haircut once a month.
Tom denied having stolen the money.
My new car is red.
Let us know if you're available next week.
Did you study yesterday?
We loaded our baggage into the car.
Let me get you some ice.
I ran upstairs two steps at a time.
We need to reinforce the roof.
Some people are difficult to please.
I feel like throwing up.
She answered in tears.
I've been in prison for three years.
They worked through the night.
Do you feel up for a game of chess?
She put on her hat to go out.
We're not ready for this.
Tom was afraid that no one would show up for the party.
I don't want you to get the wrong impression.
Who are you going with?
I just keep finding excuses.
I wanted to go.
That's what you deserve.
I think my girlfriend is kind of cute.
Tom made himself something to eat.
Let's have some fun.
He finally found out how to make it.
He succeeded in swimming across the river.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
I think it's time for me to start cooking dinner.
I know you must have a lot of questions.
Were you spying on me?
Let's face reality.
I can't count on Tom.
That's how I would've done it.
You were sleeping, weren't you?
Let's not do the work.
As soon as she met him, she burst into tears.
We adopted a child.
The train was on time.
He asked his friend for advice.
I can't depend on you anymore.
Absolutely nothing is permanent in life.
Will you try to play the trumpet?
Did you sleep all right?
No one really cares.
I took the elevator to the third floor.
The Statue of Liberty is located in New York.
I know Tom is a mechanic.
All apples are red.
We watched a movie.
He's deep in debt.
Could Tom have done this?
Tom refused to talk to me.
Did you have a good weekend?
We drove across the city.
I don't think I'm going to do that.
I really enjoyed it.
I don't care what people think about the way I dress.
We communicate with one another by means of language.
When I grow up, I want to be an English teacher.
Stop acting like a spoiled child.
We all have our orders.
I am the chosen one.
He speaks English and French.
This blue backpack is heavy.
All three were killed.
You're unethical.
Is it to go?
They're enjoying themselves.
I'm traveling light.
He attributes his poverty to bad luck.
Elephants live in Asia and Africa.
I can't remember how to go there.
I read a book as I walked.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
The more I think about it, the less I understand it.
Are you ready for the trip?
I grew up in a small town.
I'm assuming you have a plan.
The parking lot is free of charge.
Were you able to do everything you wanted to get done?
It's easy money.
They were even more interested in his beautiful wife.
I've never seen a real cow.
I can't do that either.
What right do you have to order us around?
He will excuse me.
I'd like to visit England someday.
I can't stop myself.
The work is not finished yet.
I should've gotten that promotion.
I know that would make you happy.
I feel way more comfortable now.
Go take a walk.
I think you haven't understood the question.
I don't think I've ever eaten anything that you would consider disgusting.
People are protesting against nuclear weapons.
Tom ate my lunch.
Tom goes to school by bicycle.
The climate is moist and warm.
He served his king faithfully.
Can you play the organ?
I was just wondering how you guys ever got talking about this topic.
Japan is full of surprises!
The mechanic fixed my car without charging me a dime.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Is that a bottle opener?
There are no customers.
We all want to be desired.
He teaches in a girls' high school.
Tom wanted to go home early.
It makes sense now.
I'm going to see him tomorrow.
It's nothing I can't handle.
It seems that the rainy season is finally over.
I'll do everything that I can.
Why did you let me sleep so late?
I am the laziest person I know.
Most of the suspects have been arrested.
He repairs his own car.
Please sum up your idea.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
That cut on your arm looks pretty serious.
I'm not good at negotiating.
He was the first person to arrive.
That seems clear.
Her father never let her go to town with her friends.
He flatly refused to let me in.
Give us a little space.
Why were you so slow?
Is there anything you'd like to share?
I understood what you meant.
I think that you are twenty years old.
All of a sudden the sky became overcast.
I'm afraid there is very little I can do.
I was wondering if you could help me.
I can manage that on my own.
How many men named Tom do you know?
Who's winning?
I kept an eye on her suitcase.
Tom hasn't actually ever been to Boston.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
The storm didn't cause any damage.
Tom has a migraine headache.
My mother put thirteen candles on my birthday cake.
We all live on planet Earth.
So how mad are you?
Come on, you can do it.
Perhaps it will snow tomorrow.
I've made my decision.
Tom didn't look very well.
Let's improvise.
I heard a funny noise.
I didn't ask you that.
You are early.
Please tell me the truth.
Do you have to work tonight?
The coffee is very hot.
I was unable to save Tom.
Where's the restroom?
I often stay up all night.
Is something happening?
You can't use this washing machine.
What time will you have to go to bed?
Have you finished reading that book?
You're preaching to the choir.
I escaped death.
Why should I give you that?
Does that seem strange to you?
Tom bought a house in Boston.
I'm out of breath.
I'll drop if I don't sit down.
He's dating my daughter.
Are you listening to me?
That actually sounds like a lot of fun.
That's just not enough.
Man is the only animal that talks.
I don't think we should drink this water.
I'm sure Tom had his reasons.
Can you determine what happened?
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
He gets a good salary.
Have they spotted you?
We have a warrant.
She has a boyfriend she's been going out with since high school, but she feels their relationship has stagnated, so she's become dissatisfied.
This elevator's capacity is ten people.
Were you hurt?
My uncle gave me a book.
What are some foods you usually eat with your children?
Do I look busy to you?
Do you want to take that risk?
I have many coins in this box.
Why are you so hard-headed?
I'm ready to start working whenever you are.
Tom needs help.
I rested in the shade of a tree.
How did you wind up doing this kind of work?
Bulgarian is very similar to Russian.
Have you ever been married?
I tricked you.
I was a witness.
His advice didn't help at all.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
I'm not delusional.
I won't divorce you unless you give me a good reason.
I'm forgetful.
It's all OK.
I wouldn't spend my life here.
I don't want to respect a man like him.
How much did you pay the electrician?
Is everything OK?
Your problems are similar to mine.
He was very puzzled.
It's not healthy for you.
That has to be a misprint.
She gave birth to her first child at twenty years old.
The driver sustained multiple injuries.
Take a deep breath and then relax.
You're the oldest.
He would give an arm and a leg for that.
I'm doing this for you.
I won't tell you why I did that.
She treated his broken leg.
I heard everything.
I think Tom wanted my help.
Are you a high school student?
I remember saying that.
This movie is so terrible it's hilarious.
Call me at six tomorrow morning.
We must check.
I've read all about you.
The boy made a paper plane.
I'm not like you.
They were responsible for the accident.
This is the reason I disagree with you.

He's not going.
How romantic!

I nearly choked on a fishbone.
No one said anything like that.
I'm not ready to fight.
She stopped to smoke a cigarette.
Do you think the road is wide enough for cars?
If you need anything, just call.
I'm not who you think I am.
She greeted us with a smile.
Mary is prettier than her sister.
I'm here to help you.
Everyone at the party was named Tom.
I advise you to change clothes.
We've achieved a lot in the past three years.
This is required.
Because of your advice, I was able to succeed.
He came back at about nine last night.
You're so mean.
Do you have any pencils?
I can't stand it anymore.
That was supposed to be our little secret.
It's useless to try and resist.
You talk too much, he said.
France was at war with Russia.
He left the room without saying a word.
I've been waiting for hours.
Tom washed his hair.
I don't play the clarinet very well, but I'm pretty good at playing the flute.
You must do it quickly.
I wonder where she has gone.
I can pick out only two or three constellations in the night sky.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
The ice has melted.
I've got nowhere to go.
Tom is in the waiting area.
You cannot take pictures in the theater without permission.
Let me explain what's happened.
We'll convince Tom.
I looked him in the eyes.
Tom spent three months in the hospital.
The answer's no.
There's been a misunderstanding.
I want to see him at all costs.
We closed the restaurant.
Excuse me, I have to get off at the next stop.
Stay in the car.
Have they responded?
I don't have a snowmobile.
Maybe you did that wrong.
I will stay at home.
They got to be good friends.
Look back!
He plays the guitar well.
With your approval, I would like to offer him the job.
He brought his lunch today.
Schedules are difficult to coordinate.
Don't forget your bag.
Is this some kind of joke?
Don't let children play in the road.
I'll show you how to catch fish.
That's just false.
He had no choice but to run away.
What does this mean for Tom?
You could've said something.
In 1939, as in 1914, the world was on the brink of war.
I need a room.
I do not like him either.
I'm not photogenic.
It's for you.
We did not evolve from monkeys. We share a common ancestor.
You didn't make it clear.
It is just half past seven.
I would never question his honesty.
Drop it!
One of the children is studying, but the others are playing.
He employs a maid.
It's rather unique.
Tom says he knows you.
Tom is a lazy person.
He remained silent the whole time.
He went out of his way to find the house for me.
Take off your clothes.
My father can speak French, but my mother can't.
All that has changed.
He doesn't have enough experience.
I wasn't allowed to enter.
Don't you think we deserve Tom's respect?
Are they all the same?
We'd be very interested in what you think.
Is it something you can get rid of?
I feel like I know you.
This sounds fishy.
We made a deal.
There's no need to apologize.
Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.
Stop flirting with my sister.
I haven't told anybody else.
You don't seem very concerned.
I was mentally and physically tired.
I don't dare tell him such a thing.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I was sitting behind Tom.
Tom asked Mary who had been the first to arrive.
Let me talk.
I don't want Tom's death on my conscience.
She asked him to stay, but he had to go to work.
The cottage was clean and tidy.
I want what's mine.
We're all impressed.
I forgot how beautiful it was here.
It was too long.
I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
I thought you'd be grateful.
I hate being alone on Valentine's Day.
She was quite eager in her studies.
It's clear that you're wrong.
The kite got caught in the tree.
I study English.
No one can get in or out.
No one knows the fact.
He inherited the house.
We can't back out now.
Do you need help with that?
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Tom is still confident.
That's not what we want.
He has just left home.
How do you know all these things?
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
Do you remember?
Your sister's as beautiful as ever.
His word is law.
Don't talk to anyone.
I assemble car engines.
I'm a man.
A cargo vessel, bound for Athens, sank in the Mediterranean without a trace.
It's really infuriating.
His speech lasted three hours.
Is there any life on Mars?
Sharpen these knives.
They're waiting for you.
Most of the participants are from Australia.
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
I had a great time here.
I thought you had more sense than that.
I know it's unrealistic to expect Tom to do that.
Turn your papers in.
My university has dormitories.
She gets herself worked up over every little thing.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
It's incredibly easy to cheat the system.
We sometimes go out for a drive.
He gave me a ride home.
Tom has gone somewhere.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
You're double-parked.
Are you sure that's safe?
She announced her engagement to him.
He had fun with her.
Do you understand what I mean?
When it comes to my supervisor, he's very inconsistent, so we never get any work done.
The world has five oceans.
Tom says that he's tired.
I outrank you.
I did try to warn you.
I'm not quitting now.
May I see your passport?
Tom hasn't had anything to eat since breakfast.
I'll take the next bus.
I’d like to stay for three nights.
Take a bite.
Tell us what's going on.
Where did you put the keys?
This job is killing me.
I'm glad I could be of some assistance.
Tom can't do this alone.
You will soon cease to think of her.
Do you like to live in the country?
To my surprise, he had a beautiful voice.
I taught him how to swim.
How did you find us?
It's never too early to start learning.
He ran away as soon as he saw me.
Tom's mother would've been very proud of him.
They are talking about what they will sing.
Sorry, I couldn't help it.
Tom and I both speak French.
Tom can't do the job.
We're a family.
The news made her happy.
No wonder they turned down her offer.
If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car.
Is that so bad?
I watched the game from beginning to end.
I need you to fix this.
I didn't know you had a cat.
She smokes a lot.
We're not kidding.
They kidnapped me.
I don't think I can do it.
It might sound far-fetched, but this is a real problem.
I'm sure Tom won't be here this afternoon.
I'm the only one planning on doing that.
Are you lonely?
Trains come more often than buses.
I felt embarrassed at first.
I'm your biggest fan.
You should do it.
Are you still in the job?
He likes ham and eggs.
Tom really likes traveling.
The money we offered them was obviously not enough.
I have the feeling there's something you haven't told me yet.
If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life.
Why don't you give me what I want?
I had a doctor's appointment yesterday morning.
I think it's obvious, don't you?
I am proud to work with you.
They were never to return to their country.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.
Tom went to church with Mary.
Do you know why he wasn't at school?
That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
I'm sure your intentions were good.
Do you have to work today?
You could've just told me.
I have four sisters and one brother.
I think you did a good job.
I don't like to swim in the pool.
You're taller than me.
She is very kind to us.
How do you know they're looking for us?
Tell me what I have to do.
I can do it faster on my own.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Four percent inflation is forecast for this year.
What would you take for the lot?
I have no more than one thousand yen.
She's rather good.
Do you spend much time writing email?
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
How do you know which one is yours?
I finally escaped.
Hurry up, or you will miss the bus.
He doesn't know where he should be.
Are you coming?
It's so bad, it's hilarious.
How soon are you going shopping?
They found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.
Is it possible to help Tom?
I usually got to bed about eleven.
Can you crank up the heat?
She and I usually agree.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
Let's visit my grandpa this weekend.
She lived a happy life.
Nothing succeeds like success.
I'm a management consultant.
Some of them are healthy, but others are not healthy.
I'm the one who painted this picture.
The police think the burglar entered through a basement window.
I'm beginning to feel guilty about it.
Are you free tomorrow evening?
The whole country was covered with snow.
Here we go.
I think Tom has made a mistake.
What exactly is it that you want me to say?
Don't blame me for this.
Her feelings are easily hurt.
Let's leave tonight.
You've got to be bold!
After eating dinner, I washed the dishes.
He felt it was his duty to go.
It's no use pleading because they'll never give in.
Stop Tom.
Are you sure that's safe?
I made a couple calls.
Christmas drew near.
I thought Tom was in Australia.
We'll have to wait a couple of hours.
She's waiting for you at home.
We're adults.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
I promise I won't bite.
It wasn't me.
I'm selfish.
I finally understand what you're saying.
It's all nonsense.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
In this case, let's go.
We've got to talk.
Science has discovered that there are five types of human beings.
I have your schedule here.
I've never been abroad before.
She did it for the good of the community.
I'm doing this for them.
Many young people go abroad during summer vacation.
I think you should listen to me.
Tom does love you.
They don't listen to me.
Don't be so pessimistic.
I didn't even notice you.
Take a deep breath.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner.
As soon as it gets dark, the fireworks will start.
Don't forget to stir the stew.
Do you mind if I sleep here?
I made a promise.
It looks fascinating.
Don't be afraid to experiment.
I bought flowers because my grandmother is coming today for a visit.
I can't wait for school to start.
You were terrified, weren't you?
We stood at the door and waited.
He's had some very good results lately.
It's difficult to answer this question.
Nothing was to be seen but water.
I hope the weather will be good.
He made his parents happy.
I want to see your mother.
How do you come up with such interesting plots for your novels?
I want to do some bass fishing, but I don't know what to use for bait.
I don't want my son to be like you.
I forgot my bag.
There were no clouds today.
Do you mind if I park here?
He came back from China.
A group of children were playing in the park.
That's what you do, isn't it?
I found it while I was cleaning up.
You know what might happen, don't you?
Don't leave the bicycle out in the rain.
We're going hunting.
These books are all mine.
She wrote to him to tell him how wonderful he was.
I don't need more information.
I'm afraid that's no longer possible.
The girl caught a small fish.
Do you want me to help you with your homework?
Wow, it's pretty cold today.
I met the principal himself.
I have the keys.
She was there in the morning.
May I visit an art gallery?
Nothing is impossible for God.
He turned down my application.
You should not go alone.
My sister washes her shoes every Sunday.
How did you know all that?
I swim in the sea every day.
I made a paper plane.
I'm not tired.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
You know what you have to do.
You'll get used to it.
You're good.
You never told me you were married.
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
We never got the chance.
I can't eat any more.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
He was afraid that he might hurt her feelings.
I still owe my brother the ten dollars that he lent me last week.
How's your family?
I don't want to say goodbye.
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.
Come on, guys. This is not funny anymore.
He doesn't have his feet on the ground.
They're gone.
You don't understand.
My brother-in-law is a cop.
She speaks a little Arabic.
He's old enough to be her father.
Please serve him his meal first.
I read the letter to him.
Everybody knows Tom was in Boston.
They saw us yesterday.
Please leave your message on my answering machine.
I now know what I told you was wrong.
You gotta get more organized.
Can you still remember when we first met?
Please say hello to your wife for me.
Are there any books under the desk?
They're having a break at the moment.
Give me something cold to drink.
I have to finish what I started.
We must never do this again.
I need some sugar.
If you're tired, rest.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Those who know him like him.
I'm by your side.
I only have one sister.
I want them all shot.
I hear it's buried under all that snow.
What beautiful weather!
You're the oldest.
What is my room number?
My children were taken away from me.
It's gotten better.
Are you coming with us?
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
I was welcomed whenever I visited him.
My bag was stolen.
Take care not to catch a cold.
I'm sure we can work this out.
It needs washing.
Though he is rich, he is not happy.
I'm worried about you.
Don't let anyone enter the room.
It's awesome.
I wish I could remember her name.
Do you have psychic powers?
Let's go by taxi, OK?
Why are you guys so angry?
Is it always cold like this?
I finally caught up with my friends.
Please save my place.
We'll see what they want.
He will succeed without fail.
Perhaps he could solve this problem.
I trust you.
You're in no position to bargain.
I have heard nothing from him for five years.
He kept reading a book.
Tom had never seen Mary that angry.
You should listen to his advice.
Why don't you try this one?
He is a man of wealth.
We didn't know the whole story at that time.
Can you handle it?
You're wearing my pajamas.
That leaves no room for doubt.
I don't think you would do that.
We don't have time to debate.
Bad habits die hard.
You can dance, can't you?
The storm raged for a few days.
My strength is all gone.
This dog is shaggy.
Bite your tongue.
I couldn't keep from snickering.
If the phone rings again, I plan to ignore it.
Children imitate their friends rather than their parents.
Are you falling for me?
You see that tall building over there, don't you?
I don't know who that youngster is.
He lied to me.
How much are the pears?
She's painting her room white.
That's just what I need.
Go home now.
You don't have to do it now.
The towel was quite useless.
I told you I wasn't going to call Tom.
Never drive faster than your guardian angel can fly.
You are my hero.
He is employed in a bank.
I'll give it a try.
What's your full name?
Don't patronize me.
I fall asleep easily while watching television.
They're very fond of him.
He had been ill for a week when they sent for a doctor.
You should keep your mouth shut.
I enjoyed it very much.
It wasn't Tom's idea. It was mine.
You're the one who trained me.
He is worthy to be captain of our team.
After a slow summer season, business began to pick up.
Tom didn't know what to believe.
He's three years older than I am.
You're very wise.
It's not pertinent.
A true gentleman would not betray his friends.
Do you believe him?
I'll never be as good as you.
His negotiators had disobeyed his orders.
Was that weird for you?
Who is that pretty girl?
Everyone looks the same, except the one standing on his head.
A mile is equal to about 1600 meters.
After a hectic few days at work, Tom is looking forward to a change of pace.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
The problem is you're not patient enough.
I think it's time for me to walk away from this mess.
How do you like my new suit?
Drinking warm milk will help you get to sleep.
Why did you get up so early?
Tom broke my heart.
I know that Tom isn't a Canadian.
What's it called?
She is capable of teaching both English and French.
How did he ever get so lucky?
They hid in the cellar.
We need a medic.
I have a weird neighbor.
They live in a mansion.
I am going to work out the problem by myself.
If you've got something to say, say it.
I thought so.
Apples are sold by the dozen.
May I come again?
They missed the deadline.
I'm happy and satisfied.
I then began to understand.
I need envelopes.
You must not make noises in the classroom.
I think the police should enforce the laws that are on the books.
I'm not interested in politics at all.
Tom is his brother.
His youngest son is five years old.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened.
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
I'm sore all over.
Aren't you embarrassed?
They want us to come in right away.
I'd like to visit Australia.
I received an email from Tom this morning.
Do you know me?
There is a bank in front of the hotel.
I have three dogs. One is male and the other two are female.
Tom raised his right hand.
Don't try this at home.
The mafia boss was killed in a hail of machine gun fire.
I reviewed the file.
Do you have dinner plans?
You're the only one who can help me.
I'm glad to meet you.
How many were wounded?
It is windy today.
I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.
There are way too many people in this room.
From the position of the wounds on the body, the police could tell that the attacker was left-handed.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
Do you think there's a hope?
I live in Boston.
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
She is good at making up interesting stories.
Tom accused Mary of being a liar.
I feel very comfortable with you.
The two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
She is getting prettier and prettier.
I really appreciate all your help.
Instead of taking notes, I spent the whole class doodling.
Please knock before entering.
He tried writing a short story.
His wife doesn't seem ugly to me.
He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't.
I know what it's like to be alone.
I still need some help here.
Tom lost his car key.
Tom's confused.
They don't have a car.
Does it hurt anywhere?
Tom certainly got the message.
We have guests.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
Do I look OK?
Make me happy.
Many of the students were tired.
How long will this rain go on?
I'd like to reserve a seat.
I always feel sleepy.
It's an experiment.
I was at home all day yesterday.
When I try to walk, I get an awful pain here.
Ronald Reagan was born in 1911, in the little town of Tampico, Illinois.
I wasn't making fun of you.
I crossed the river by boat.
I don't know how I did it.
Do I have to dial the area code, too?
Where's your mother?
When will you get through with work?
I've run out of ideas.
I think it's a wonderful thing.
Put your valuables in the safe.
He is no longer in business.
What did they say to you?
I have no idea how many people will be at the picnic.
She is kind to old people.
I want to keep that.
Nobody's going to hire you.
He caught a large trout.
Tom doesn't like baseball very much.
We were amazed at the excellence of the boy's drawings.
Everyone looks confused.
Tom has become a father.
You are hilarious.
I need to ask you a few more questions.
Dinner was excellent.
Tom advised us not to do that.
I've given this quite a lot of thought.
Tell me more about this.
I want you to read this letter.
He denied the accusation.
I know you want to help him.
Don't burst my bubble.
I'd be devastated.
Tom didn't know Mary.
Tell us what you want and we'll try to get it for you.
Am I early?
I don't recognize this shirt. Whose is it?
Tom thinks Mary will be upset.
I want to catch the 11:45.
Are you sure you can do this?
Why are you being mean to me?
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
Tom will always love Mary.
We would often talk about our future.
I ought to know, shouldn't I?
Are you jealous?
I have nothing to report so far.
He will come after all.
That's where I was born.
We can't turn back now.
She advised him to take better care of himself.
Show me the way, will you?
May I use your phone?
Who will play the role of the princess?
Lend him as much money as he needs.
Quite a few people came to the meeting yesterday.
Is there anything to drink in the fridge?
I'm sorry about last night.
Have you confirmed it?
Who broke the vase?
I'm not strong.
I appreciate your conviction.
You don't seem very concerned.
They deceived us.
I was just looking around.
I like all of them.
Clearly you are mistaken.
Asians eat a lot of rice.
Guess what I'm holding in my hand.
How do we stop Tom?
It was an amazing experience.
I want you to help me die.
The door is open.
He had the last laugh.
They live in a mansion.
I won't be going with you.
He urged his government not to sign it.
We went to high school together.
Do you have an extra key?
Is she Japanese?
I don't really know.
War may break out at any moment.
Give Tom some room.
We avoid talking about politics.
There are a lot of parks in London.
Ironic, isn't it?
We're being watched.
You have no right to be here.
Your dog is very fat.
He finally fulfilled my request.
I was aching from the injury.
The crops have withered.
Give me a beer.
I'd like something to eat.
Feed the hamster.
It will soon be September.
Today is tomorrow's yesterday.
The door will be painted tomorrow.
I expected a little privacy.
You can't prove a thing.
Something happened.
The offer is too good to be turned down.
I think it'd be great if you could come.
I can't find it.
I wanted to say something, but I was too scared.
Nothing can save them now.
Tom almost never speaks French.
I wouldn't be too surprised if this song became a hit.
Let the pigs eat that.
I love to cook.
I gave orders I was to be left alone.
I'm kind of surprised.
A few days later, he came.
This is different from what I thought.
You could've ruined everything.
Your composition is the best yet.
Tom wants to buy a new car.
How did you come by this painting?
Do you think Tom can find it?
Why are you dressed like that?
Look! There goes a shooting star.
I was feeling nostalgic.
I took your name off the list.
We were all shocked.
He walked away.
Where was your daughter?
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
I enjoy your company.
She bought him some candy.
Do you remember us?
DNA tests showed he was innocent.
In the end, they approved the proposal.
I outrank you.
We didn't think of that.
We know where you were.
I got nauseous.
We're in pain.
Your room is ready now.
He wasn't there last week.
It is difficult to understand his theory.
They're brothers.
It's the best-kept secret in town.
I can't take another step.
I can't do what you want.
I will warn him.
Tom went skiing alone.
Whatever you say.
I want to make something clear.
Is anyone looking?
Tom headed toward the door.
How will you manage without a job?
It's kind of you to drive me home.
He said he would not come in, but he came in after all.
She is about my age.
I'll be inside.
It feels like I've known you forever.
We can't go there.
Tom denied having said such a thing.
I went out by bicycle.
What do you know about him?
You don't care about me.
This is a spotted dog.
That gave me a rough idea.
Was anybody else there?
I don't know if I can do this job.
I feel good here.
I've already been shot twice.
Better to be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion.
Tom found your cap.
Tom ordered a glass of wine.
She is sewing a dress.
Tell me your life story.
I thought I'd never see you again.
People throughout the north were angry.
Be nice.
Your face is always dirty.
Tom's parents were asleep when he got home.
Don't talk about work. We're on vacation.
She is curt.
I don't understand why this keeps coming loose.
We are sorry to say that we can not give you that information.
Our class consists of 40 boys.
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
I'm not one to gossip.
I no longer want to live in Boston.
I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
Why don't you come visit us?
I need you right now.
I've tried to explain it to Tom.
She hated him.
You're talkative.
I can hear the wind.
It's outdated.
I want you to have a job that you love.
I have a serious problem.
I don't like being inside.
Give the book to whomever wants it.
I know you like coffee.
Do you care about your privacy?
He differs from his brother.
I admit I did that.
I don't think I could live without you.
We spoke briefly.
Where can I leave my bicycle?
I don't know how far.
The population of this city is on the increase.
You can do that.
Thank you for your encouragement.
You must ask for permission.
She married him.
I'm supporting you.
I really enjoyed last night.
I made no promises.
I've been drinking a lot of coffee.
You're the oldest.
Are you telling this story or am I?
You've told me that joke before.
I found what I was looking for in the drawers.
I'm well aware of the risks.
They gave us their word.
Tom has been hoarding food.
She was almost late for school.
Why are you depressed?
You need to take care of the dog.
He cleared his throat before starting the lecture.
Some believed his story, and others did not.
I appreciate your telling me this face-to-face.
Do you know what color she likes?
We don't have a cat.
Tom put a flea collar on his dog.
I refuse to answer the question.
I prefer to go by bicycle.
Happiness isn't merely having many possessions.
Where did you go fishing?
I just don't want to let you down.
The bad weather prevented me from going to work.
I arrived yesterday.
You can't park your car here.
I can't go back there and neither can you.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
Looters stole ancient artifacts from the tomb.
We became best friends.
He OD'd on cocaine.
I helped them yesterday.
Is this what you want?
Cats like boxes.
This makes me curious.
He went upstairs to her room.
What Tom likes most is whiskey on the rocks.
He was given up for dead.
I had a good job.
That may not be possible.
You don't have the nerve.
Why did you quit?
May I use your eraser? I seem to have lost mine.
I could see that.
Did it ever occur to you that I might be busy this afternoon?
Did you do yesterday's homework?
What is he running after?
She advised him to be punctual.
I must obey.
He went for a swim in the lake every morning.
The situation is very bad.
I make it a rule to study math every day.
What bugged me most was having been deceived.
She can't suppress her emotions.
I'm willing to attend the meeting.
Wear warm clothes or you could get sick.
May we accompany you on your walk?
I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
I hope you will succeed in winning the prize.
The length of this ship is 30 meters.
They want more.
Do you have a match?
I prefer a lighter color.
I was hungry and angry.
Why don't you go take a nap?
Tom and Mary built a sand castle on the beach.
I think it's dangerous.
Try not to disappoint me.
I wish you did not have so many problems.
We never do that.
I'm just kidding.
I like the way this flower smells.
You don't want to be an editor?
You always were a good dancer.
We have no more in stock.
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
You can't put off doing that any longer.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
It was hot last night.
I must decide what to do.
It is easy for me to answer the question.
I didn't want you to miss your bus.
Tom won first prize.
Only time will tell you if you're right.
You're so wrong.
I'm glad you could make it.
I will write to you soon.
I'd rather do this by myself.
It cost me 50 dollars to have my watch fixed.
We feel frustrated.
What would you like to do?
One man was injured.
There's no wind here.
I'm not married to Tom anymore.
I can neither confirm nor deny the rumors.
Are we prepared?
Her shyness makes me like her even more.
I finally found out what happened.
I wanted you to see that I'm not all that bad.
Are they actually friends?
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
There are almost no books.
Do you think I'm to blame?
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
She likes talking best of all.
It began to rain before I got home.
Excuse me, but do you mind if ask your name?
He worked through the night.
This shouldn't take too long.
I finished my math homework.
It is going to be rather cold.
We need to call someone.
There were fifty passengers on the plane.
Did you order the book?
They won't make it.
Did you write this?
Why are you all sad?
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
Let go of my hand.
I have no idea where we are.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
I regret a lot of things.
Don't judge a man by his appearance.
I have lots of time.
I have an ear infection.
I'll never be able to sleep.
He had decided on a new policy.
I like my coffee without sugar.
We all had hope.
The fugitive made a run for the border.
He's not paying any attention to me.
Don't talk!
I figured that you'd be impressed.
I'm interested in the history of Australia.
Take it all.
He is going to be a doctor when he grows up.
This apple is bad.
She grabbed a shower.
It's none of your business.
He has a lot of things to do.
He works the night shift.
I want to live in a castle.
She declined to say more about it.
I was born in Tokyo on the eighth of January in 1950.
Am I that transparent?
Do you have any kids?
What happened to the others?
I hardly ever remember dreams.
I don't know who you are and I don't care.
Tom and Mary know John lied.
You're the one that went crazy.
How long are you planning to stay here?
You have a tendency to talk too fast.
Living in a cluttered home is very stressful.
Everybody got off the bus.
Tom likes to drink beer.
Are they taking care of you?
When can I see you again?
You have to promise not to tell anyone.
She advised him not to believe everything the teacher says.
I have known her since she was a child.
I was barefoot.
I thought that Tom was in Australia.
Why do you have to go?
I suppose that's OK.
We'll have to deal with it.
I succeeded thanks to his advice.
I knit every day.
I will bring it right away.
I have news.
Nobody answered my question.
How long will this nice weather last?
That's close enough.
Why is there so much violence in the world?

I think these are genuine.
Do you enjoy talking?

I am lost. Can you help me, please?
I think we should do that again.
He said it as a joke.
Stay a while.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
Tom needs something to eat.
I had to defend myself.
I had business to take care of.
Ask anybody.
This is what happens when you don't pay attention to what you're doing.
Tom looked at the ground.
I want to leave today.
Tom doesn't want to read that book.
Come closer and have a good look at this picture.
You're a very gifted artist.
You do that and I'll fire you.
The police are looking for you.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I asked Tom who his French teacher was.
Tom has allergies.
Why were they scared?
You promised me that you would make something for us to eat.
I thought I saw something.
Please say hello to your parents.
I'd like to know what it is.
Do you like your coworkers?
The hunter put ammunition in the gun.
I'm sure we can figure out a way to get this done.
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
I had no idea you could speak French so well.
We caught you.
Close the gate.
I needed to meet you.
He survived the plane crash.
I don't know if we're going to make it on time.

Tom allowed Mary to leave early.
He is not running in the coming election.
He is blind in one eye.

I'll stay here until ten.
We put up the flags on national holidays.
Am I bothering you?
Madeira is the name of a wine.
The car wouldn't start.
Stay in your car.
The most important thing to do now is for us to remain calm.

Several children are playing on the beach.
One of my hobbies is making artificial flowers.
The boy takes after his father.
That's not what I just heard.
You're creepy.
How long do you study English every day?
I am worried about him.
If you continue doing that, you'll probably get injured.
I can't stand this pain any more.
Do you understand that?
He has the same camera as I have.
This is so dumb.
I just assumed everything was going to be OK.
Is this really happening?
Tom couldn't help but notice all the beautiful women on the beach.
School bores me.
Who sent you here?
They kept their relationship a secret.
Nobody wants you to do this.
You've said enough.
I'll ask Tom to teach me how to drive.
No one could solve the puzzle.
Don't you get it?
Tom helped his mother decorate the Christmas tree.
I was unlucky.
Anything you say may be used against you.
I accused him of cheating.
It has been raining on and off since the day before yesterday.
Would you like to be famous?
He's somewhere in the park.
This is also important.
Would you excuse me?
Tom was extremely impolite.
Don't cry. Everything will be OK.
Nobody believed what I said.
Did you shut the door?
Are you sure they can do this?
She used to date him.
I have a bad sunburn.
Everybody falls in love at least once in their lives.
I'd rather stay home if it's all the same to you.
How long will you be here?
Did you know this was coming down?
She was busy.
I think I can beat Tom's record.
This tree does not bear fruit.
I was the only one at the meeting who didn't think that was a good idea.
No one lives here.
Earth is a planet.
I studied hard when I was in school.
He resigned from his office.
Some factories pollute the environment.
I never thought that would happen.
You don't know where it is, do you?
Strictly speaking, you're wrong.
You're a nervous wreck.
The goods arrived yesterday.
It was dark and I couldn't see anything.
Maybe she is coming.
Owls have big eyes.
I'll call you on Monday.

Let's look at what the report says.
The old couple gave him up for lost.
Am I supposed to answer that question now?
I hear you're moving out.

I'd be much obliged if you could give me a lift into town.
I belong to the sailing club.
I just keep finding excuses.
He is an angry drunk.
He can't do that.
Where did you get all those keys?
Don't say anything.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
I was sleepy.
Let's not get that carried away.
I don't know how to explain it.
That's a big one.
Unfortunately, I'll have to pass.
I want to know where they hid the money.
The two brothers are still alive.

She served the family for twenty years.
The knight swore an oath of allegiance to the king.
The old dog barked.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I had to see you.
That fact can't be denied.
I fully agree with all of you.
It is inconceivable to me that he would do such a thing.
I'm very tired.
They kidnapped me.
I'm afraid Tom will get lost.
He described exactly what happened.
Why are you angry? "I'm not angry!"
I need a few more days.
I need colored pencils.
I touched the bottom.
How many songs have you written?
It is ten minutes before eleven.
What a horrible man!
He's a talented writer.
I got no answer.
Tom stayed.
Come sit with us.
I can't get back to sleep.
Do you know how much a kilo of rice costs?
I want to take a closer look.
It was excessive.
You must not yield to temptation.
We'll all be there.
I have to solve the problem myself.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
I was dizzy.
It's incredibly easy to cheat the system.
Don't stand next to the window.
Did you find a job?
Did you find everything you want?

This has shaken my faith in the institutions of government.
Did you get my gift?
Whose car is that?
I don't like swimming in salt water.
It's hard to get a taxi outside the station.
He came at about four o'clock.
English is not easy for us.
I have one thousand dollars in travelers' checks and five hundred in cash.
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
I went skiing in Canada last winter.
Are you doing all right?
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
This stays between you and me.
What is my room number?
I'll write to you soon.
It's been a very difficult year.
They're not going to give you this job.
That's exactly what I was doing.
Don't talk about business while we're dining.
She claimed to be the owner of the land.
You'd better check that.
We've all seen it.
I want to get out of here as fast as possible.
Crows all but destroyed the farmer's field of corn.
We're slowing down.
I have to leave you.
I'm sorry about this.
You've brightened my day.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
I think everybody's tired.
May I take pictures here?
I can barely pay my rent.
She is a very kind girl.
You're so mean.
I need more time to make up my mind.
I love what you're wearing.
Do I have to do it over again?
You'll have to discuss that with Tom.
I consider you one of my closest friends.
I'll fix it now.
Having finished all her housework, she sat down on the sofa to watch television.
I've decided to study kanji.
I guess I need a little sleep.
You don't have a choice.
Tell Tom that I won't be there.
Stop being so nice to me.
It's nice to be appreciated.
Are your parents in now?
The apples which he sent to me were delicious.
I arrived at the stadium at 4:00 p.m., but the game had already started.
Please refer to page ten.

What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
What's new with you?
Did you see the news?
I'm pretty uncomfortable right now.
They let her marry him.
Believe it or not, I went skydiving.
Speak into the microphone.
Tom is close to thirty.
I wasn't talking to you.
We all make mistakes, right?
Tom sat between us.
What do you think about it? It'd be great!
I can't help thinking my father is still alive.
I want you to stay here longer.
Don't forget to mail this letter on your way to school.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
I ordered fries, too.
He writes scripts for TV shows.
This isn't an easy task.
There are no easy answers.

What kind of work will you do?
That's what everyone's saying.

Welcome back.
Is she a doctor?
Put on your pajamas.
Aren't you a psychologist?
They'll be here tonight.
Do you need some water?
Do you really think it's bad?
Is it accessible?
This dictionary is mine.
It is not a real mansion.
Nobody is laughing now.
You're very curious.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
Does anyone have a picture of this?
He took part in the race.
It's better to be crazy than to be boring.
It looked funny.
Are you sure of your answer?
No one followed me.
Do you like robots?
You should go see a dentist.
I'm not good at French.
The enemy is weak.
It was your idea.
That's really all I know.
Should I start?
Let's go by train.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Are you in a lot of pain?
Are you busy?
I want to ask you a question.
You've still got all your life in front of you.
I have no idea how long I was unconscious.
This is an unexpected surprise.
History is repeating itself again.
You don't have to hurry.
Please tell me.
You've got a vivid imagination!
He is watching TV.
I can't believe you're eating what the doctor told you not to eat.
What's in this bag?
She repeated over and over that she was innocent of the crime.
I don't want your job.
He's Swiss.
Feel free to call me if you need anything.
He wants to participate in the contest.
You can never be happy if you feel envious of other people.

The child painted flowers.
I'll leave that to you.
She fell in love with him the first time she met him.

You'll be able to take many pictures with your new camera.
Have you ever sold a car?
I'm not really hungry.
Where's my box of chocolates?
That's not yours.
My cat is hiding under the stove.
This is a little gift for you.
I really don't feel well.
They admired the lovely scenery.
They painted the fence green.
I figured I had enough money.
I'm not scared to die.
Who's going to drive?
Everyone looked relieved.
I sat watching an exciting game on television.
They're lucky to be alive.
I've heard that name somewhere before.
A little rest would do us a lot of good.
There were twice as many university applicants in 1992 as in 1982.
Tom is in Boston now, isn't he?
I knew it would be painful.
We're late because of you.
I feel like I've been reborn.
Tom bought a very good camera.
Have you seen Tom lately?
He was nearly hit by the car while crossing the street.
I thought I was on time.
I've been thinking about it, too.
I have plenty of friends.
I eat here all the time.
I was the last one to start in the race, but I soon caught up with the others.
I thought that book was difficult to read.
I'm not good at fishing.
Where's your family, Tom?
He went to the shop.
It didn't take you long to get here.
I'm only a customer.
I really can't deal with that right now.
Can I have one of these?
What brings you here?
What fun!
Who's your friend?
I had a crush on you when I was twelve.
He expressed himself very well in English.
That doesn't make sense to me.
I already know where Tom works.
Don't forget your water bottle.
You'll never escape that way.
I can't understand the meaning.
Tom broke his nose.
He slipped while crossing the street.
You have to do it today.
There was a strong wind on that day.
Do you like apples?
You nearly broke my jaw.
Tom decided to risk it all.
Tom and I study French together.
Have a good day.
I don't know what the big deal is.
You're the only person I know who is my age.
I didn't believe him at all.
Don't touch this with your dirty hands.
I didn't want that to happen.
How about a cup of coffee?
I didn't like it.
I'm not a psychic.
She sued him.
I guess it's time to go.
The man must be insane.
I didn't eat enough.
I've decided to go with you.
How do you assess your students?
A mouse is running around the room.
I know Tom isn't against it.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
Do you know where she is?
I can't stand to see animals be teased.
It was extremely hot, so I took my coat off.
Is Tom right?
Scientists are slowly piecing together the mechanism of aging.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
My mother has gone shopping.
I'll do everything for you.
Tom had no choice but to quit his job.
Buffalo bones were made into tools.
I feel like going to the movies.
He can't be young.
We should never give up.
Don't they drive you mad?
Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?
I didn't mean to offend Tom.
I can still hear you.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
I'm not supposed to drink.
I've been trying to get a hold of you for the past two hours.
I'm the spokesperson for this organization.
What day is today? "It's Monday."
I was discouraged.
Come on! We're going to be late.
I need you to tell me what to do.
She urged him to study harder.
I may not be completely objective.
I kept the seat warm for you.
Have you been out at all?
She told her children to put away their toys.
Do you eat lunch at your desk?
It was such a boring speech that I fell asleep.
Just mind your own business, please.
I mistook him for his brother.
It wasn't much of a party.
You'd better be careful not to catch cold.
Tell the truth no matter what.
I don't understand why you don't want to go to Boston with us.
I changed my mind.
That was a lie.
Don't you know his name?
His birthday is August 21st.
I'd like to go home.
Mary wore a simple white dress.
I got this one for $300.
If I were you, I'd start immediately.
Why are you questioning me?
I didn't rescue anybody.
I think you might need some help.
Did you drop it?
How's your sister?
I can't remember his name.
I went to Boston to visit Tom.
You'll never want what they want.
I don't know which of you is older.
I cannot do without this dictionary.
Tom should've been home on Monday.
Let's try to be discrete about this.
Do you think that any really smart person is inherently interested in languages?
He's come to make trouble.
I hear from him once a month.
Will you help me?
He has broad shoulders.
Why are you so tired?
What's the most delicious fruit in Japan?
The hardest thing in life is knowing which bridges to cross and which bridges to burn.
I like instrumental music.
Could you lend me the book?
The dog is asleep.
I thought there was somebody in the room.
Show me where it happened.
Hold the box with both hands.
How long have you waited?
Talk to my boss.
I hate carrots even more than I hate onions.
I just wanted you to accept me.
As far as I know, she has not yet married.
I don't even have one.
Do you have jeans in my size?
He gave me a ride home.
No one could find the cave.
Put the broom in the closet.
We are going to have a baby.
The date of the party is still up in the air.
I'm at your disposal.
There is no sense in your worrying about your health so much.
I don't understand it.
You're not satisfied, are you?
I'm on the way home.
Do you need a ride?
The bicycle is mine.
I don't have a very good dictionary.
I'm acquainted with Tom.
It's true that she's dead.
You're probably thirsty.
The more you play, the better you'll get.
He is not much better, and there is a little hope of recovery.
I feel like playing, too.
He did it in front of the staff.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
I feel very sick. I want to throw up.
I didn't think we'd be able to get in.
You were wrong after all.
That's hers.
I'm going to bed.
Instant noodles are a staple among college students.
Go have fun.
I was more than a little disappointed.
Dry your face with a towel.
I am sorry.
The businessman appeared on television this morning.
Tom wanted Mary to sign his yearbook.
Father is anxious about my health.
We didn't stay in Boston.
You were pretending, weren't you?
Tom didn't tell me who he was waiting for.
Mary is moderately attractive.
They found it.
Is there any other way I can pay you?
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
Do you have something to say?
Can I bring a friend?
Tom left his dog at home.
I am thinking of closing my savings account.
We have a new puppy. He is about 12 weeks old.
Hurry up! If you don't, we'll be late.
Look at that dog.
I made you coffee.
We'll have to deal with it.
Tom can't afford to retire.
Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you.
I've always wanted to write a children's book.
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
The official could not deal with the complaint himself.
Don't stand next to the window.
I opened the box, but it was empty.
Please speak more loudly.
Who did that yesterday?
She's dependent on her husband.
She's not as old as Mary.
I can't believe I'm here again.
Tom isn't worried.
Do you have shoes and socks?
The park is open to everybody.
I believe you, but unfortunately Tom doesn't.
I don't particularly want to do it.
I feel feverish.
This lake is deep.
I know Tom will be objective.
My daughter is looking forward to Christmas.
What do I get?
It's up to you.
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
Loving is the essence of life.
I only wish I could see you more often.
I saw you.
I kept my mouth shut.
I went to see my parents.
You were drunk, weren't you?
I had the feeling you were going to ask me that.
It was only a hypothesis.
She, of all people, wouldn't do such a thing.
He came to meet me yesterday afternoon.
You'd better consult the doctor.
Why were you so busy yesterday?
I've already answered this question.
I had to keep my secret.
I've always wanted a daughter.
I'm not saying anything.
They complained of the room being too hot.
He has a racket.
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
We stayed at a hotel by the lake.
It is a pity that he has no sense of humor.
We had a lot of furniture.
Don't get up.
They relaxed in front of the fire.
It was his best time.
Tom will be here by evening.
Tom died three months ago in Australia.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
If you wouldn't mind, I could use a hand.
I'm glad to see you here.
Was there anything else you wanted me to do?
What's your speciality?
My father spends a lot of time on his hobby.
This happens all the time.
Does that mean you won't come?
We should go this way.
I want to be treated with respect.
This music makes me sick.
I informed her of my success.
I'm asking you to stay.
This doesn't make any sense to me.
Tom spoke into the microphone.
I don't have to go right away.
You must come every six months for a check-up.
I didn't know Tom had died.
I don't want to offend you.
I forgot my pen.
You have to do it by yourself.
How did you get to know her?
Have you heard anything about the organization?
Tom stole Mary's bicycle.
I put it here somewhere.
Why would anyone want to kill me?
Our plans are not yet concrete.
Her oldest son is not married.
I'll be direct.
That doesn't help me.
She went with him.
Was I really boring?
His clothes are worn out.
Everything is becoming more and more complicated.
She loves Tom.
Every part of the island has been explored.
Don't let go of the rope.
I admit that I was wrong.
It's foolish for you to swim when it's this cold.
Did you know this at the time?
Is that what you want to do?
I like dogs very much.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I had half a grapefruit for breakfast.
It needs to be perfectly symmetrical.
We have far better things to do with our time.
Is it about ten million yen?
Look at the picture on the wall.
I was caught in a traffic jam.
You'd better come.
I could hardly understand him.
Where's the director?
I hope to build a new house next year.
She was afraid to make a speech.
Doesn't it smell like bacon?
The kids are scared.
Do you have a smaller size?
Tom doesn't want to stop.
He drives me crazy.
He has no eye for women.
Have you done this before?
They didn't so much as hint at it.
I just gave blood.
That's not what he said.
We want jobs.
She wrote to him to tell him how wonderful he was.
I like playing sports.
If he keeps threatening you, then you should go to the police.
I don't think I can help you.
Every word is significant.
The weather was not only cold, but also wet.
I want everyone to bring their children.
I didn't steal it.
She went out to look for a taxi.
I am ashamed of myself.
That made me mad.
Tom certainly couldn't have succeeded without your help.
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
My parents have kicked me out of the house.
I'd like you to meet my sister.
We had no trouble.
Please step inside.
He's addicted to junk food.
You know it's a lie.
That's not very romantic.
Have you ever scolded your daughter?
I came for you.
You have the necessary skills.
The traffic light changed to red.
Wait one moment.
Tom seemed to know the secret.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
I only took a bite of bread.
Goodbye. I'll see you at the time we agreed on.
I hate ironing.
She still loves him.
I left the keys in the ignition.
I know that plenty of guys want to go out with you.
As far as I know, she is a very good person.
What happened to my furniture?
I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never came.
You may not believe it, but it is nonetheless true.
Excuse me just a moment.
It's very likely that he'll be late.
I wonder why tennis is played in mini-skirts.
They're going to find you.
Don't let them see you're afraid.
Why did you lock the door?
What is your ultimate goal in your life?
Tell me what to do here.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I really enjoy spending time with you.
There's no need to hurry.
What a nice family!
I thought you might like to know where we'll be going next weekend.
You're thirty thousand dollars in debt.
What do you think of this plan?
I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
Isn't that just a brush fire?
I can't tell you the answer to that yet.
Have you ever been abroad?
You could well be right.
It's the highest building in this city.
He is working hard in order to pass the entrance examination.
Tom didn't laugh.
First of all, I'm very worried about my daughter's health.
I only want what is rightfully mine.
I eat my breakfast at seven o'clock.
My heart skipped a beat when my wife told me she was pregnant.
You had a week to do this.
Fortunately, no passengers were injured.
He will arrive in Kyoto tomorrow.
I got to the bus stop just after the bus had left.
I know Tom is a strong man.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
Since it will be cold soon, it might be nice to enjoy doing something outdoors the final few warm days we have before winter sets in.
You have a lovely daughter.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
My wife wanted to adopt a child.
There was a car accident yesterday.
I am going to have a great day today.
It'll cost at least five dollars.
I arrived too late to hear his speech.
That's not for Tom.
What do you think I'm thinking about?
I want to show you something.
Let me stop you right there. We don't want to hear about that.
Can we speak in the hall?
That's why I'm here.
This is all your fault.
You must be joking!
He would accept no compromise.
They are five in all.
Did you take part in the discussion yesterday?
Are you still at the office?
I am really pleased with my new car.
The floorboards creak a bit when you walk across them.
What were your impressions of Tom?
I don't think I can do it.
You really expressed yourself quite clearly.
That house is big.
I'm contented.
Why are you asking this?
The two women know each other.
I'm looking for a French penpal.
You're in love.
You must never lose your temper.
I don't want you to think I'm nuts.
We've got a situation here, you know.
He's just a liar.
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
Go ahead, try it now.
I'm going to study French this afternoon.
What's all the hubbub about?
You won't be fired.
Tom seemed a bit disoriented.
I was taken aback by his rudeness.
He got up early so he'd be in time for the train.
I want to see you smile.
I really like this wine a lot.
Don't talk about me.
I ran so I would be on time.
It's no use arguing with him.
Let's start at 2:30.
You don't have to sing.
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn't have done that.
You're in danger, Tom.
He fell asleep right away.
I'll come and see you later.
The green lampshade casts a warm glow in the room.
That needs to be corrected.
Go and help your brother.
Are you referring to me?
Are you still unlucky?
How many sisters do you have?
She advised him to come back at once.
Be careful.
Your children look healthy.
They've had plenty of time.
I want to talk to you alone.
This is so hard.
Tom is on leave.
This oil painting dates from the 17th century.
I have to finish the work by four o'clock.
I want to have a telephone installed.
I have no idea where we are.
Are they Japanese?
They started dancing.
I was unprepared.
Please take more care in the future.
What can you make out?
My father doesn't drink too much sake.
Eat whatever you like.
What did your mom say?
Tom was Mary's late husband's best friend.
I don't know anything about that.
I have an appointment.
I don't want you to go home.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
I'd like to dance with you.
That's a true story.
It's anybody's guess who will win the next race.
I've heard a lot about you.
I felt like I was intruding.
Tom wasn't wearing a belt.
Tom is a guest.
You're not getting any younger.
The conference takes place annually.
She gives him everything he asks for.
I'm shorter than you.
She wanted him to say that he loved her.
I had to do something.
Tom fractured his wrist.
She greets him every morning as he enters the school building.
The only golden rule is that he who has the gold makes the rules.
How do you know how thick it is?
Let go of my hair.
I neither smoke nor drink.
Let us out.
Are you still jealous?
I don't remember where you live.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
He can speak Japanese.
Can you stay for a few days?
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
When was this university founded?
I'm not used to this heat.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
They haven’t slept for forty-eight hours.
There are big differences in broadband speed and quality from country to country.
She sleeps on her stomach.
Wake me up at seven o'clock.
He always looked happy, but never was.
They awarded her a gold metal for her achievement.
Can I see you a second outside?
No one warned us.
He removed his sunglasses.
You did not come to school yesterday.
I can't reach the ceiling.
He's never been abroad in his life.
Wine helps with digestion.
I'll lend you my notebook.
I enjoy salsa dancing.
I despise you.
The new engine must undergo all the necessary tests.
He's a crybaby, just like always.
This car is very expensive.
You should do that while you still can.
I get very angry when you don't answer my questions.
The train arrives at platform number 5.
I felt my heart beating violently.
Once he had written the letter, he sent it.
My German vocabulary list is up to two thousand words now.
Was I polite enough?
If he doesn't come, what will you do then?
I talked to him on the telephone yesterday night.
I took the job.
You can't erase the past.
What was the outcome?
How many combat situations have you been in?
I need to press the button.
Grab a broom and help us clean.
She is almost as tall as you.
We talked about what we could do.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
You don't look that good.
I'm staying over at my friend's place.
It's a misunderstanding.
We're not leaving.
This dog is white.
Tom asked the waitress for the wine list.
I'm not a university student, but I'm brighter than them.
I like her dark eyes.
It's not enough to just say you're going to vote. You need to vote.
Why do you think it happened?
Some people don't believe in any religion.
You're upset.
I can never thank you enough.
What did she mean?
Try to remain calm.
That man stole my purse.
I haven't thought much about it.
I can't believe you chickened out.
What time do you have supper?
I think we can do better.
It would be better to stay home today.
Are you ready for the next problem?
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
Stay away from my daughter.
I had no luck yesterday.
Is there something you want to say?
I need that.
She made it plain that she wanted to marry him.
That's a funny thing about people like you, you don't want to get your hands dirty.
I need sugar.
What do they do with all their leisure time?
I want to visit Cuba before Castro dies.
Your father got a promotion.
How long will we have to wait?
You don't want to do anything rash.
An extremely terrible thing happened to him.
I don't feel like laughing.
I haven't met Tom's parents yet.
I was confident.
You might have heard of me.
He's a jerk.
Your mother and father are dead.
Do you have fire insurance?
She looked all around.
I couldn't look at it any longer.
Why do you have to do it?
They stood up for what was right.
Don't tell anyone we're doing this.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Have you been told where the meeting will be?
I spoke to Tom about what Mary did.
I'd like to remind you that you're under oath.
It's riskier than it looks.
What're your plans for the weekend?
Do I look like I'm having fun?
That was perfectly normal.
He told me to meet him there.
Can you show me how to do this?
I already told you that a hundred times.
You'd better watch what you say.
It is none the less true.
Tom told Mary he had to talk to her.
You're bright.
Don't you want to go?
Did I mention that before?
I didn't sleep much last night.
I want my money returned immediately.
Where did you go last Sunday?
I loved you.
I don't have time to spend with my kids. "You should make time."
Please turn up the sound.
The book you're looking for is on my desk.
Open the windows.
We're meant for each other.
It is kind of you to say so.
Anybody here?
I wish it would stop raining.
I didn't walk for a year.
We didn't tell you that.
She suggested that I write to him at once.
Be friendly.
This medicine has no harmful side effects.
I was never told that I was supposed to be at that meeting.
I held my breath and waited.
I was no match for him.
Four people were in the car when the accident happened.
My mother set the table for dinner.
Take it.
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
Tom is wearing his wedding ring on the wrong hand.
I think Tom doesn't like to ski.
Next time you come, don't forget to give it back to me.
Let's all go.
I want the truth from you.
I still have a lot of questions I want to ask you.
Does Tom like Mary?
They have been good neighbors to this day.
What's in those boxes?
I got used to working overtime.
I have no idea how it works.
She pretended not to hear me.
Have you ever been in love?
The cat loves playing in the garden.
That's the answer.
It was a resounding success.
He narrowly escaped being run over.
He stood behind his mother.
Our school library has many books.
We need your help to do this.
Tom said that he doesn't regret his decision.
I'll be with you as soon as I finish this job.
Tom refused to eat.
He is not interested in art at all.
I want to get my mind off work.
I like this room.
They all stopped.
They're all dead.
She often calls him names.
My whole body is sore.
This hat is mine.
How am I supposed to dress?
They live in a city close to Beijing.
Tom seldom speaks to Mary anymore.
I hid it in my sock drawer.
I never thought about it that way.
What's your son's name?
What was their goal?
You're unusually quiet today.
Your mother has made you what you are.
I'm not scared of anybody.
He is quite a gentleman.
I knocked, but no one opened the door.
Take a look at the FAQ before you call tech support.
He leaned against the wall.
I want to make sure you're going to be all right.
What did you do to get grounded?
If you would like to have further information, please contact me.
I asked him his name.
Tom really likes chocolate.
Tom means what he says.
Tom can't even read.
I feel awful about that.
I'd suggest we don't go down that road.
If I were you, I'd think twice before going down that path.
What is your phone number?
Get in the boat.
I had a feeling you would be late.
I agreed with her.
Many people think that children don't spend enough time playing outside.
They are singers.
What is your name?
I don't think this old car will make it to the top of the hill.
We all knew it.
I've heard nothing.
This movie is for adults, not for children.
Dance with me.
They arrested her.
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
I saw her home.
Did I have a choice?
Is that really you?
I heard from him last month.
You killed my father.
I'm not that drunk.
I know Tom is from Boston.
Come over to my place.
I was here at 10 sharp, but you weren't.
Tom introduced his sister to me.
How are we going to get there?
Birds are singing here and there in the park.
I'm not available.
Don't worry about the past.
I think you're funny.
She's smarter than him.
Be content.
It could take years before this bridge is ready to use.
Is Tom still in the hospital?
You're thirty thousand dollars in debt.
Where can I pick up my baggage?
The chimney is belching black smoke.
I took the liberty of calling her.
Look at that good-looking boy.
She pretended not to hear him yesterday.
You need to wash your hands.
Letting Tom do that wasn't such a good idea.
We should finish this.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
Keep trying.
Have you been here since?
I want my key back.
How can you eat at a time like this?
It's easier than it sounds.
It's an unusual name.
He resembles his father very much.
You look like an imbecile.
You didn't have any choice.
Who was that you were just talking to?
Can't you help us?
We're going back to Boston.
They looked very happy.
That's all I can tell you right now.
She was looking forward to going to a movie with him.
That's why I'm giving it to you.
Sometimes it's hard to be tactful and honest at the same time.
They have few books.
I like neither of the pictures.
His recovery was nothing short of a miracle.
What horrible weather!
We debated on the question of world population.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
It's going to be harder this time.
Tom was screaming at Mary.
His little brother is a famous soccer player.
Tom put down his spoon and picked up a fork.
Tom won the contest.
She was chosen from among many students.
While I was waiting for the bus, I witnessed a traffic accident.
You had better give up smoking at once.
You need to see a doctor.
What do you want me to do?
The light is green.
Banks open at nine o'clock.
I just wanted you to accept me.
Can you help me?
We're about ready.
We need both.
Clean it up.
He became a sailor.
We won't have time to help you today.
You're not the problem.
Tom didn't come to school yesterday.
We were worried about you.
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind.
I know that you're very angry.
I still don't understand the problem.
We know you're not stupid.
The prisoner escaped from prison.
You're starting to scare me.
Since I had met him once before, I recognized him right away.
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
How do you know where I live?
Am I the only one who agrees with you?
I always wondered what that noise was.
He was raised in an artistic family.
He shared in my happiness.
You woke me.
I started crying.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
There's nothing to report.
Did you study yesterday?
It was quite easy for me to carry the plan out.
Give me a reason to stay.
I already told you that a hundred times.
Diamonds are forever.
I saw Tom and Mary talking to each other this morning.
Do we have any more beer?
Here's a knife you can use.
All citizens should respect the law.
I enjoy movies.
Where were you that whole time?
You're depressed, aren't you?
I still live at my dad's place.
I decided to take his side against the others.
The man lost all hope.
At this beer hall, you can order beers up to one liter in size.
I wasn't competitive enough.
That's not what I'm looking for.
It must be nice to have friends in high places.
You're my friend.
The well ran dry.
I don't need you to take care of me.
Would you be friends with me?
Tom certainly knows a lot of French.
They're both beautiful.
Tom managed to escape through a window.
This camera is Tom's favorite.
I've changed my mind again.
She teased him.
I was just wondering if you have any experiences you would like to share with us.
You don't need to hurry.
Why did you come over here?
Should I take this medicine?
You're partially responsible.
I gave you fair warning.
The sculptures are of great value.
I think Tom wants something to eat.
I have to make the best of that small room.
The committee accepted the proposal.
Lie still.
We have a wide choice of books.
I'm not sure that that's possible.
I woke up at sunrise.
If you're tired, go to bed.
Your house is very nice.
I'm pooped.
We are facing a violent crisis.
I don't feel like doing my math homework now.
Tom is a convicted felon.
What causes it?
How would you describe yourself?
She is afraid of cats.
Tom and Mary like the same kind of food.
I've got a meeting at 2:30.
I've been following you.
Everyone hoped that she would win.
I got out of bed and had a good stretch.
That comes in handy.
How often do you play sports?
I feel like another beer.
He traveled on business.
I have to dress up.
I know that Tom is a strong guy.
Don't despair.
Are you blushing?
I was the first to begin speaking.
She felt happy to see him.
She told me an interesting story.
I copied in my notebook whatever he wrote on the blackboard.
Do you have a twin sister?
Are you insured?
I bought a bicycle instead.
You seem very nervous this morning.
According to the newspaper, he committed suicide.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
Tom drank milk.
She suggested that I give it to him right away.
I love the way you talk.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
I've never felt this way about anyone before.
Can I see you tomorrow?
There was a suggestion that the general meeting should take place in October.
Think of your family.
Father always says, "Do your best."
Cross out all the wrong answers.
An old man was resting in the shade of the tree.
Watch how I do it.
I'm doing fine.
If he asks us for help, we'll help him.
Tom goes to high school.
I walked along the river.
Use it or lose it.
He will leave Japan in April.
Did you paint this?
You should go to bed.
Tom needs open heart surgery.
Would you like to have a drink before dinner?
Almost everybody has already gone home.
The sun was shining brightly.
The child is sleeping on his stomach.
I don't know who you're talking about.
I suggest you tell me the truth.
He promised to meet him at the coffee shop.
She urged him to consider the request.
Can I do this later?
He had three sons who became lawyers.
She stayed out in the rain.
Tom didn't go to the lake last summer.
I'd like to try on this dress.
I waited a while.
I never knew his first name.
You will not be able to go through the book so quickly.
I suppose you already know that's my car.
Where are my glasses? "Where you left them."
They arrested him.
He has no house in which to live.
My mother still calls me Tom.
Can you help me carry this?
Children watch adults.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
He told me to leave the window open.
They had several children.
Are there enough chairs for everyone?
I'm afraid we can't rule out the possibility that she may have the disease.
I was lost in the crowd.
The tower is fifteen metres tall.
Tom is as old as Methuselah.
The operation had to be kept secret.
I've asked you not to do that.
That's why I called you.
She is always finding fault with her husband.
They had a heated argument.
Do you know what's in those containers?
Are you going to go or not?
Please try again.
You're sleepy.
Please leave.
Why is the train late?
You didn't tell me that you were a doctor.
I always counted you as a friend.
Houses built with wood burn more easily than houses built out of stone.
We arrived tired and hungry.
We're handling it.
The rumors were false.
That's very considerate of you.
Please come around someday when you aren't busy.
Which way are you going?
How have you been doing lately?
You've got another four day's journey before you reach Moscow.
English cannot be mastered overnight.
She told him where to put the suitcase.
I demand satisfaction.
Let's try doing this again.
We've been here before.
I don't mind if you leave.
He gets really testy when he doesn't get his way.
You continue making the same mistakes time after time.
I'm going to see him tomorrow.
I think I did well.
There's someone with Tom.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
When the last customer leaves, we close the doors.
They're right behind you.
Please make yourself at home.
Do you know why?
That's a stupid name.
They made him work.
It's very likely that he'll be chosen.
Don't follow me.
I just haven't gotten to it yet.
Who do you know here?
Tom is bald.
The dressing room is over there.
Cover the seeds with a little earth.
Tom and Mary were eating in silence.
The boys played cops and robbers.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
His job is to teach English.
Six months is a long time to wait.
I'll always remember you.
He has been studying for two hours.
Mary pretended she was sick to avoid going to school.
That really bothers me.
I promised I wasn't going to do this.
Tom wasn't born in October.
You're putting words in my mouth.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I need a laptop.
We should work faster.
It's time to go to bed.
What did you find out?
Is eating fish good for you?
The last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat vegetables.
Thank you for your understanding.
That's my younger sister's photograph.
Are you allowed to go?
Why do you always have to get involved?
I asked the stranger where he was from.
Getting people to change is extremely difficult.
Tom is in intensive care.
Let's play chess another time.
He is always giving presents to his wife.
Thank you very much for your present.
Tom is managing all right.
Tom wants Mary to meet his mother.
I try not to think about Tom too much.
I must be getting close.
I think that's enough.
He has three times as many books as I have.
Keep your hands off my bicycle.
Tom is kind of worked up about it.
The plane will take off in one hour.
I know Tom did that for us.
I thought that went well.
I told Tom what had to be done.
Don't you have any good news?
I'm not surprised to hear that.
We have checked.
She was approaching thirty when I first met her.
I know I've helped you.
I have to take some photos for my class project.
Do you know what this is all about?
I want you to find out.
Kyoto is famous for its old temples.
Nice weather added to our pleasure.
Don't drink that.
My grandparents died before I was born.
You have lots of phones.
Are you home?
You can't give up.
I don't like Tom at all.
I'll take care of you all.
Love me, love my dog.
You've got a pretty good memory.
Tom didn't say why he wasn't happy with our work.
He intruded on her privacy.
I'm allergic to shellfish.
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
She's at the hotel now.
Please translate this Japanese text into French.
How much does this watch cost?
You don't belong here.
I gave up.
He only speaks one language.
I think they like us.
The main valve is turned off.
I think Tom is right.
It's bad luck to say that.
You should make up your own mind.
I think I've persuaded Tom to donate some money.
The spoken word matters.
I'm thinking of having dinner at 5.
According to the contract you may take three days of bereavement leave for your uncle's funeral, but only one for your nephew's.
Over 300 people were arrested.
We were both in the library.
Is that love?
She put her elbows on her knees.
I could hardly hear him.
I met her on a certain winter day.
You might not find it.
You're not upset, are you?
What should I wear?
Yesterday it rained the entire afternoon.
Tom isn't good-looking.
No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't please him.
I just wanted to have fun tonight.
You'd better come see this.
Is it you?
She refused to accept the post.
I want to know who started it.
Tom had to wait three hours.
You reek of alcohol.
You can't blame me for that.
Are you lying to me?
It's our only show.
So what were we talking about?
I had to stay in bed all day.
I was trying to be supportive.
We could see the flames coming toward us, so we ran in the other direction.
Are you for or against the bill?
I don't want to miss my train.
I can't get my money out of the bank today.
I think you'd better leave.
I don't see anything.
He ran the risk of being caught and imprisoned.
My brother has a good memory.
You didn't get very far.
I want to know if my baggage is going to arrive.
This cell phone is really expensive.
Which floor do you live on?
A is 5 times as long as B.
Even the teacher could not solve the problem.
Are you tired of living?
Having lived in Tokyo, I know the city well.
Don't worry about what others say.
I cannot agree to his proposal.
Forty people were present.
He would rather die than disgrace himself.
Didn't you hear your name called?
You could've died.
Keep your hands up.
Look out for cars when you cross the road.
May I eat a little of it?
Forget it!
Maybe Tom was the one who stole Mary's necklace.
May I come and see you tomorrow?
Tom took some coins out of his pocket.
He anonymously donated a large sum of money to the Red Cross.
How can you be sure of that?
He leaned towards me.
Tom knew who Mary's boyfriend was.
I made no mistakes.
Tom advised Mary not to stay out late at night.
All our children go to school in Boston.
I'm depending on you.
I know Tom was unfair.
I need water.
We talk to each other every day.
Can you walk?
What happens if I press this button?
I can come at three.
Tom's heart suddenly began to beat faster.
Please pass me the salt and pepper.
He bribed that politician with a great deal of money.
What's the saddest movie you've ever seen?
I wish Tom the best.
Do you understand the concept?
You were afraid, weren't you?
Tom doesn't speak French.
I don't like waiting in line.
I've read that book.
The old lady climbed the stairs with difficulty.
Thanks for the compliment.
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
The jury found the man guilty of murder.
He has more books than I do.
Some words are hard to define.
I'm well aware of that.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
I always catch colds in the winter.
What does any of that have to do with me?
I can barely stand his behavior.
He didn't say anything.
A man's worth lies in what he is.
I'm fine. How about you?
After that incident, he never drank again.
Let me show you how we do that.
Tom is going out with a Chinese exchange student.
It doesn't belong to you.
I just want you to remember this feeling.
I just don't know what to say.
He unbuttoned his shirt.
I know the real reason for his absence.
It's been a long time since I've seen Tom this happy.
I have a sharp pain here.
I'd be happy to work with you.
I can't pick this lock.
I'm afraid this key does not fit.
What are you going to do tonight?
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
Nobody wants to look stupid.
He apologized for having offended her.
Women were given the right to vote.
He is too much of a coward to attempt it.
Does Tom speak French fluently?
He gave me an apple.
The lunar month is shorter than the calendar month.
I've given this a great deal of thought.
I think it's time to eat.
This doesn't concern you.
I don't want to be tied to one company.
How do you heat the house?
He explained the plan's main objective.
Tom told me you were afraid.
It's been a long time since I've done anything like that.
He hit a ball with the bat.
Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?
Never mind what he said.
She has never had a bad experience.
I've had enough of your snide remarks.
Don't be afraid of seeing the doctor.
Keep me informed.
She heard someone calling for help.
I'm behind schedule.
Do you have health insurance?
She is on the teaching staff.
That company is managed by my older brother.
According to the contract you may take three days of bereavement leave for your uncle's funeral, but only one for your nephew's.
He is an experienced teacher.
You're fascinating.
I figured that might be the case.
These trousers are too large.
You are doing very well. Keep it up.
The teacher treated all the students fairly.
Tom never breaks promises.
You know this isn't the way we should be doing this.
Don't share this with anyone.
Shut up, he whispered.
Don't shut your eyes.
Mary's closets are full of clothes she hasn't worn in years.
Let's play dodge ball.
You're very observant.
If you want one, you'll have to find your own.
I was very busy yesterday.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
She wrote him a long letter, but he didn't read it.
Call home!
Don't be so childish.
Try to do your best.
You're impressed, aren't you?
Almost all the students believed the rumor.
Tom and Mary are a nice couple.
Copy this program on your computer.
She got out of the car.
She is not so much a singer as a comedian.
Plan for the future because that's where you are going to spend the rest of your life.
I have no one to talk to.
They're so cute together.
The new president was a warm and friendly man.
He complains about one thing or another all the time.
A camel is, so to speak, a ship on the desert.
I've done all that.
Is there a hotel around here?
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
Do they like wine?
Can it wait?
How did you come up with that answer?
I wasn't hired.
I want to see a volcano.
I no longer believe it.
Please take a seat.
We dance together.
You were perfect.
You're poisoning me.
I forgot what his name was.
I found a rare stamp at that store.
I have a ton of work to do today.
Her hair is very short.
I work for a hospital.
Do you want to get drunk?
The store might be closed already.
She is two years older than you.
I wonder if this is wrong.
I don't want to talk anymore.
Her eyes are blue.
Can I use your toilet, please?
Actually, I'm kind of busy.
He looks very good.
The war in Europe ended.
Tom's delighted.
I know someone was here.
We are doctors.
All is quiet.
I guess we were happy.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Is it important?
I went to the bank to take out money.
The bus turned around the corner.
I think he's coming, but I'm not quite sure.
That's what I'm saying.
I felt winded after running up the stairs.
I cover twenty miles a day.
It's a matter of vital importance.
Yesterday, I read a really interesting story.
Don't talk like that.
The classroom is full of teenagers. A couple of them are asleep.
I wrote her a letter every day.
Do you have something to say to me?
I think I need to go.
This problem may be solved in a variety of ways.
They say love is blind.
I plan to study this afternoon after I get home.
He died ten years ago.
They have company.
It's business as usual.
We found Tom's umbrella.
I'm touched.
We rested on some stones.
She died in a plane crash.
The baby is fast asleep.
Are you through with the paper?
She didn't go far.
He's attracted to Asian women.
Hi, guys.
I started sailing last year.
I think Tom probably knows about it already.
I had such high hopes for you.
Can I tell you something very personal?
It is very cold today.
Who gave you this envelope?
I just had a talk with your doctor.
I am going to buy a new car.
I'd rather stay home than go fishing.
I will think of something.
He is very eager to go there.
Call up Tom right away.
Change was in the air.
Tom bought himself a microscope.
My bike has a flat tire.
Hold fire.
Do you have an appointment?
You want this?
What a remarkable performance!
Further testing is required.
The month is drawing to an end.
Guess who's coming for dinner tonight.
I help my mother with the housework every day.
The same holds true for Germany.
My father is a businessman.
Do you mind much?
I am a Muslim.
Tom ought to stop doing that.
I'd really like to know.
My sister usually walks to school.
What's your real name?
I brush my teeth after eating.
It was at that very moment that the bomb went off.
We took turns cleaning the room.
We have a majority interest in the company.
Do you want to come with us?
Where do you swim?
Are you going to come back?
You could've been hurt.
Thanks for stopping by.
Tom can count on Mary.
I can't feel it.
They're looking for a scapegoat.
I don't see the connection.
I have to think this over carefully.
We're very close.
When would it be convenient for you?
I decided to go out and explore the town.
Do you have health insurance?
We're all going home.
He lives on this street.
She wants a new hat.
He got very proficient in English in a few years.
I don't know what this word means.
Tom went to the park with Mary.
Follow his example.
The fire started immediately.
I've got a ton of homework.
Tom won't mind.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom is the only person who can help me.
I'm reliable.
Let him in.
How well can you dance?
I have no money to buy the book with.
Tom found your cap.
Save me some ice cream.
Do you know who wrote this book?
He went from Tokyo to Osaka by plane.
She is engaged to him.
I only did what was necessary.
Tom married a Canadian girl.
Nice timing.
Either you or your friend is wrong.
We went for a walk on the beach.
Tom told me that he hated Christmas.
These are my sister's magazines.
I can't let him alone.
I have very good eyesight.
Do you remember who I am?
I'll stand by you in time of need.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
We needed your help.
She as well as her friends is fond of music.
She closely resembles her mother.
Kabuki is an old Japanese art.
Take out the trash.
Have him come.
I'm giving it back.
Many fish died.
Are you happy with that?
He can't stay long.
Some people think that gambling's a sin.
This mountain is difficult to climb.
You just have to ask for it.
I can't figure out how to operate this machine.
Why are you asking?
Tom knows what you did.
What I really want is something hot to eat.
You're charming.
Let me explain this.
The ship sank with all her crew on board.
There are several ways to measure speed.
He was taken care of by a young doctor.
Personally, I think you're right.
I have to button my jacket.
Can I use your pen?
That one's all yours.
It was your idea.
Where can I reach you?
Let go of my arm.
Tom and Mary sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
He looks to his uncle for advice whenever he is in trouble.
That's a good start.
You will have to apologize when you see him.
Can I take my jacket off?
How long were you at the party?
Let's leave it up to him.
Could we get a bottle of your best champagne?
Can I get a minute with you?
Get off at the next stop and take a bus headed to the airport.
I'll help you look for Tom.
Control yourself.
I’ve made a few corrections.
It's hard to imagine a life without pets.
He had called the rebels traitors.
You have no right to do this.
If you can't come, please let me know ahead of time.
Tom looks exceptionally bored.
I'm fascinated by cats.
To make matters worse, it began to rain.
I usually wake up at six.
Young men such as you are needed for this work.
Give me a coffee, please.
What'll it cost?
We did that.
We were very busy last week.
I climbed in through the window.
What is he aiming at?
I'm busy getting ready for tomorrow.
Tom won't leave until he's talked to Mary.
Don't make me go back there.
You really should try this cake.
They danced all night long.
How did you know I was going to say yes?
Do you feel sick?
I read the letter again and again.
I don't want to talk about it now.
Make way, please.
I realize that you guys wouldn't be here if you didn't have to be.
I can't believe he kissed you.
What's 5,814 rounded to the nearest thousand?
I used my imagination.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
It was very disappointing.
This is worrisome.
It's not true.
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.
I did not play tennis yesterday.
That cost him his job.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Is he afraid of death?
Tom has a wonderful voice.
She tells him to give her all of his salary and he does.
What're you drinking?
I bought every book on Japan I could find.
He was covered with mud.
I studied French in college.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music for the bassoon.
She showed me her room.
I will fight to the death.
He got me a watch.
Are you envious?
He probably won't become famous.
He looked as if he knew all about it.
The decision has not yet been made.
That'll be seven dollars, please.
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
This is the same watch that I lost a week ago.
The garbage collector comes three times a week.
Tom will write to his sister.
I should've listened to Tom.
Tell Tom that I'm in Australia.
I'm sympathetic.
He is regarded as the best doctor in the village.
He makes good use of his time.
He thinks his job is pointless.
I can't remember his explanation.
Turn it off.
His brave deed earned him respect.
The man must be insane.
What a great idea!
I'll have what he's having.
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
I believe what is written in her letter.
It looks like we're almost out of the woods.
Tell Tom the truth.
Who did you meet there?
If you're tired, go to bed.
That sounds awesome.
Be careful!
She's always grumbling.
We can try it.
We get together once a year.
I don't know exactly where.
The surgeon took out his patient's appendix.
I don't speak Japanese.
How can I do that?
Can you briefly sum up what was said at the meeting?
I'd rather be hanged than shot.
We're investigating the deaths of Tom and Mary.
She went on speaking.
Meeting girls is hard.
I know very little about him.
I never wanted to have children.
All of my relatives are taller than me.
Will this satisfy you?
I think I could get used to living here.
There are no more bullets in my gun.
I hate when other people make me wait a long time.
It would be crazy to do that again.
I'll invite whoever wants to come.
No one saw anything.
He is not religious.
If I don't do it now, I never will.
Please come back at once.
Do you need a bag?
What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
Tom caught a fish.
I haven't seen Tom since Monday.
I need to be alone for a while.
Have you been to Boston?
I'm not at all afraid.
Let's compromise.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I saw a plane.
He got more than he bargained for.
What do you think you'll do with your life?
Cold weather and insects destroyed their crops.
Please put it back in its place.
He got hooked on drugs at a young age.
He may have missed his usual bus.
This doesn't change anything.
How can you be so cruel?
Did you do all this?
He was absent from school because he was sick.
Is it complicated?
The biggest concern is cost.
You're not dead.
It doesn't sound too bad to me.
Please have my baggage brought to the station.
I'll be free.
I don't understand women.
Tom would like to be reincarnated as a woman.
I want you to have this.
I've just returned from a trip.
I don't know what to say to Tom.
I am too short.
You've been very kind to me.
I want to find true love.
Do you take American Express?
Let's do this later.
I expected you home an hour ago.
Is it a joke?
A flight attendant was rescued from the wreckage of the passenger plane.
We were delayed by the heavy traffic.
If you put more tea leaves into the pot, the tea will taste better.
Let me think this over.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Tom was having a bad day.
I want you to want me.
If I'd known it, I'd have told you.
We must not be late.
Tom's girlfriend is a lot younger than he is.
She began to sing.
We ran around the park.
She promised to marry him.
You'll go far.
The boss spoke in a condescending tone when addressing the female staff members.
I've been really lonely these past two weeks.
You ruined my life.
You shouldn't go to school.
Let me write down the address.
Which film did you see?
He got caught.
I can't go to work today.
I love the beaches in Australia.
He failed, due to lack of money.
Tom called back.
Tom is an optometrist.
It's a bit cold, but it probably isn't worth putting the heater on yet.
I know people.
I didn't know you had a brother.
She has a cold and is absent from school.
I was disappointed by the news.
Tom wants desperately to believe that what Mary said is true.
I hate Sundays.
I'm going to tell you what I think.
A one-way ticket to Birmingham, please.
Anybody can read it.
Do you like Moscow?
We're so proud of you!
It's against my religion.
I was really anxious.
At times, I can't trust him.
What keeps you up at night?
He's cleaning out his closet.
You're a filthy liar!
It can't be done.
I put it in your room.
Is there something you're not telling us?
I like your place.
I'm confused now.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't help Tom.
I'll show you the way to the station.
Do you have some wine?
He did not turn up after all.
She kissed him on the cheek.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
You don't look comfortable.
You're not missing much.
Let's hurry so we can catch the bus.
We saw a funny movie last Sunday.
I love doing this.
Let's do it!
The only thing I have now are memories.
They went to the zoo by bus yesterday.
Everybody at school hates me.
What hotel will you be staying at?
I feel there is just no way out.
Introducing foreign plants, such as palm trees can damage ecosystems.
She is used to traveling.
I invited her to a movie.
I can't go back without you.
I really am very busy, Tom.
Do you have anything to say to us?
I understand your reasons.
You've got to wait.
I'm miserable.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
I just thought of something really interesting.
You have to believe in yourself.
I knew this was too good to be true.
This table is expensive.
I don't have time to do it.
I chose to wait.
I saw him with my own eyes.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Who else helped you?
He'll run out of luck sooner or later.
I'll go wherever you want me to go.
Give this book to Tom.
Who broke the window?
Tom is a lot older than us.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
I was sure of it.
The first step is always the hardest.
I just don't feel like it.
I know what you are thinking.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
Steel traps are illegal.
That was quick.
The men are wearing short sleeve shirts.
Be merciful.
I realized I couldn't win.
Cookie's mother died of cancer.
They were very hungry.
If we leave now, we should make it.
All of a sudden, it became cloudy.
This makes me curious.
Tom soon fell asleep and started snoring.
It just doesn't make sense anymore.
You cannot read this novel without crying.
The story is full of holes.
Frankly speaking, I don't like you.
I've had a lot of work to do lately.
The cage is empty.
Nobody is too old to learn.
Sorry about earlier.
Are you giving me another chance?
That's what we're aiming for.
He has to stay in bed.
Which one of us do you like best?
I had been reading for an hour when he came in.
Did Tom eat?
Did you see it?
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.
I didn't do that for Tom.
This suitcase is too heavy for you.
All the players did their best.
Can you do it faster?
It's too far away.
That depends on you.
He told me to be kind to others.
I found it in the attic.
I'll get there before you will.
May I use this?
From now on, let's eat lunch in the kitchen.
I think that's enough for now.
That was one of the biggest mistakes in my life.
Everything is back to normal.
I'd like the bill, please.
Most of the students already understand this.
I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.
I asked Tom why he had never gotten married.
I am older than him.
I'm afraid we have a problem.
She talks as if she knew everything.
They had a heated argument.
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
Don't talk in a loud voice here.
I love lasagna.
I'm still waiting for your answer.
The history of China is older than that of Japan.
How can I make a telephone call to Japan?
The petals floated on the surface of the water.
You can't deny that.
He was wet all over.
This tea is really sweet.
My husband is away for the weekend.
It isn't just for show.
I'm going to join a demonstration.
Don't keep me waiting here like this.
Could you please tell me your height and weight?
Wait until tomorrow morning.
I was too stunned to talk.
I want a scooter.
What happens when an unstoppable force hits an unmovable object?
Visitors are usually asked to remove their shoes before they enter a Japanese house.
That's really awesome.
They can't hurt me.
I want to talk to you about tomorrow.
That sounds familiar.
I don't need your permission to do this.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
She has known better days.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
I do not trust him any longer.
We had a little problem.
Let's go swimming with Tom.
Tom likes being the center of attention.
I don't like the way he looks at you.
There are five fish in my aquarium.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I know what you mean.
We had an oral exam.
What am I being accused of?
Why were you absent yesterday?
You're through.
I usually drink a lot of milk.
I saw the match on television.
Have you told me everything?
Why can't I go to the party?
He was very patient.
The news is too good to be true.
That patient may die at any time.
He continued walking for a while.
The question was rhetorical.
Is there something in particular that you want to hear?
When it was stretched, the material tore.
Isn't there anyone you know?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
He often comes late.
The music stopped.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
The road is blocked.
I have doubts about the success of their plan.
Why should I give you this?
You probably don't want to talk to me.
Shall I cut it in half?
We are not amused.
He is crazy about skiing.
Who should we believe?
They despise you.
I just think we need to be extra careful.
My idea is different from yours.
He is amusing himself by playing video games.
She advised him to come back at once.
My dog was sound asleep.
That's only a toy.
I figured I could count on you.
Tom will be here every day.
I accept your terms.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
I thought it was an important decision.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
I put it here somewhere.
I spoke to him in English, but I couldn't make myself understood.
Are you free tonight?
I stayed in bed all day instead of going to work.
It is a book.
I'll grab it.
How are you holding up?
I have a car.
I want a job.
I wasn't able to believe him at first.
Real men go to the gym to pump iron, not to do aerobics.
That's all true.
Do we have milk in the fridge?
You told me you'd come.
Are you with someone?
Tell me where the wine is.
I didn't say it was easy.
I've heard everything.
Let's work.
You're not fat.
He became world famous.
It often rains here.
Whose is this bicycle?
Do you want popcorn?
If Tom hadn't invited me, I wouldn't have come.
I'll be singing a song at Tom and Mary's wedding.
I blew on my hands to warm them.
Are you with the FBI?
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
I said that I was confused.
I want to go to school in Australia.
If you have a good garden, it will enhance the value of your house.
Did you fall in love with her at first sight?
They know what happened.
Please put on these slippers.
You're very astute.
Do you know why Tom killed himself?
Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
You are very brave.
I didn't feel well.
You'll come to like her.
How can you be so sure?
We were actually pretty lucky.
We go fishing once in a while.
Nobody came.
I felt somebody pat me on the shoulder.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Do you think I should write to Tom?
Tom is extremely busy now.
Is that you?
Don't touch anything without asking.
Have you always lived here?
Tom is standing on the table to change a lightbulb.
First of all, you should talk it over with your parents.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
There's not a big difference.
How about this one?
She quietly entered the room.
I can't pay the rent.
Is it a direct flight?
I'm not ready yet.
It's one of the oldest buildings in Boston.
Get them out of my sight.
I think Tom has gone away.
He asked for more money.
Our debt is more than we can pay.
I didn't realize you were awake.
When's dinner served?
You are not Japanese.
You didn't tell me everything.
Tom always thinks he's right.
You're not my friend.
She inferred from his silence that he was angry.
I think you're cute.
I just wanted to be sure.
They lived a happy life.
We spoke briefly.
We're realistic.
Do you have to do that now?
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
He is thinking it over.
She hates him.
You're going to be very proud of me.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
They are here.
I know that you're guilty.
Do you believe him?
I've been making too many mistakes.
Have you ever milked a cow?
I'm afraid of dogs.
She knit him a sweater.
Do you want to dance?
Nobody knew what to do.
I booked a seat.
I shouldn't have gone there by myself.
I'm not sure what I was thinking.
This room is air-conditioned.
Tom told us to be quiet.
You look just like your father.
The party ended at midnight.
I don't feel like doing it today.
Give me a glass of water, please.
What are we going to do next?
I'd be happy to discuss that with you.
We can't trust anyone now.
I had a terrible dream.
You may change your mind.
As always, you have understood poorly!
You look fabulous.
You need to see this.
That's too much.
You're not finished.
It's entirely up to you.
My bike is not anything like yours.
They accused him of telling a lie.
I am sorry if I disturbed you.
You must not stay in bed.
Who's their mother?
I stayed up till late at night.
I can't stand ignorant people.
He will be waiting for you about two o'clock.
I wasn't talking about you.
Learning French is useful.
We're not fussy.
Are you sure he can do this?
You don't have to come see me.
You don't have to go.
I want to see that movie again.
You nearly broke my jaw.
I'm still not buying it.
Why is Tom quitting?
There are a lot of parks in London.
The woman gave birth to a baby girl.
Be polite to everyone.
I can't go with you.
She likes to go walking by herself.
Come alone.
No one cares.
Have another.
They left.
Tom decided to call the police.
I'm finished with you.
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.
Tom knows how to tell a good story.
It's not your style.
There he is.
How much is this hat?
In all probability, we'll arrive before they do.
He always troubles himself about minor things.
I'm a serious person.
I caught them by surprise.
We need it.
I may die tomorrow.
Mom is now in heaven.
She wouldn't go for a walk with him.
He is blinded by love.
I demand punctuality.
I take a shower every morning.
Do you remember what Tom was wearing yesterday?
That student runs fast, doesn't he?
Do you remember your father's birthday?
How about going to the movie?
Control yourself!
This isn't everyone's cup of tea.
We skied down the slope.
You're staying with Tom, right?
I was lucky that I was able to find a good babysitter.
Could you come back a little later?
I wonder why he is so angry.
He is not much of an artist.
He went out in the rain.
Tom is still outside.
My father is tall.
It's obvious.
Tom has accepted another offer.
That picture brought back a lot of memories.
The young woman's face became even redder.
This book is easy enough for children to read.
I was careful.
We'll make an exception of your case.
Tom isn't a Japanese citizen.
I want to take a shower.
She is always free in the afternoon.
Would you like some more iced tea?
Get away from there.
All is still.
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
You said you were happy.
She has a lot of friends here.
Shut up!
This river is very dangerous to swim in.
I think it's time for me to abandon that idea.
He speaks English well.
I want to leave this box here.
Tom and Mary were only thirteen when they first met.
My father has gone to China.
Tom's arm brushed against mine.
I wasn't expecting you to do that.
You have one hour.
You're shy, aren't you?
I'd like to find somebody to talk to.
Can anybody stop them?
I'm sorry, but I don't have any small change.
I tried to call him up, but the line was busy.
Can I give you a ride?
Tom is afraid of Mary, isn't he?
Tom was genuinely worried about Mary.
Tom was awfully bored.
He went upstairs to her room.
I owe what I am to my father.
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
Who can do this work?
I think it's time for me to come clean.
I have a few things I want to make clear.
Please knock before you come in.
Taste it.
How many days does a leap year have?
I appreciate your work.
The higher you go, the lower the temperature.
His incompetence began to irritate everyone.
I'll take it all.
I know his real name isn't Tom.
I sat behind a very tall person at the theater.
How could you not notice?
The sky is getting brighter.
Tom is not as fat as I am.
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right away.
I'm not very happy, either.
I never should've broken up with Mary.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
It's no easy task to keep up with him.
The title of the document needs to be centered.
He will never give in even when he is wrong.
I like English very much.
He expressed his feelings in the form of a painting.
I had business to take care of.
This is not good at all.

He's what they call a walking encyclopedia.
He keeps making the same mistake.
Are we leaving soon?
Do you do this every day?
He pretended not to know me.
The book is easy.
I thought I told you not to make trouble.
Leave it there.
Start reading where you left off.
Where do the airport buses leave from?
You don't know the system.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
I ate too much yesterday.
I need to find out who he was.
Does Tom know you like him?
You're very attractive.
He had the right idea.
She helped me out countless times.
I'm stunned.
My work is almost finished.
Sorry, but it all came about so suddenly that I haven't got a handle on the situation yet.
I have terrible pains.
Someone has to pay the bill.
I'm deaf.
I appreciate all you've done.
Let's pretend we didn't hear that.
She asked him where he lived.
How old were you when your father was killed?
How lovely!
Could you give me a leg up here?
I forgot, she said.
He has been gaining weight.
I motivated you.
I brought you some lunch.
What are you laughing at?
How do we find it?
We're here to finish the job.
They supported his right to speak freely.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
Stop correcting me.
I don't know how to handle children.
Everyone was looking at me.
Who is going to play tennis?
She was busy knitting. In the meantime, he was taking a nap by the fire.
Why are you asking so many questions?
Seen from a distance, it looks like a ball.
Tom is looking for a wife.
Are you still there?
He tried to soothe the angry man.
I don't consider that adequate.
I was stunned.
There is a man waiting for you at the door.
Don't make fun of children.
That's nonsense. Nobody but a fool would believe it.
You can't attend? Why not?
I'm fussy.
I can't understand this sign's meaning.
They know what's going on.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
I owe you a lunch.
I'm not narrow-minded.
All good things come to an end.
What have they done to you?
This makes no sense to me.

Few students are interested in reading this novel.
There is a photo of Tom on Mary's desk.
Where are your credit cards?
I left my umbrella on the bus.
That's not exactly what I meant to say.
Young people love adventure.
This is your last opportunity.
I don't know how to do this.
I thought you were a man.
Please write down your name.
I'm sorry for what I said. I was out of line.
You shouldn't eat that.
If you have any doubts, let me know without any hesitation.
It's kind of disgusting.
At night, parents tuck their children into bed.
I'll make some calls.
The mere thought of it is enough to make me happy.

His son has what it takes to be a good doctor.
The thief ran quickly.

I did as I was told.
What a great view!
I like you a great deal.
His son is sick.
The only thing that matters is that you are safe.

I'm sure that Tom will come tomorrow.
She runs fastest in our class.
There's a problem with that.
There is an urgent need for money.
I don't think that she will come.
Leave it.
I love being around him.
The size of the universe is unimaginable.
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
He stopped drinking.
Your pronunciation is excellent.
We'll be back after the break.
Cut the power off.
Tom put his glass down.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
She's loved by her friends.
I was hoping I was wrong.
Who are those women?
I'll admit I'm wrong.
Is that seriously what you think?
I'd like to go swimming this afternoon.
They followed you here.
I like to think so.
I don't have the time or the money.
My father drives a very old car.
She's a bit naive.
I prefer plain materials.
Don't wait for me for dinner.
Don't leave your things behind.
Let me take your suitcase.
Why did you quit?
Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
That's it. I've done all I can do.
How much time and energy do you spend on projects that don't make you any money?
Your mother has made you what you are.
Be a good boy.
You're such a liar.
Do you like going to work?
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Listen.
Do you know that boy who's crying?
I think they like you.
Their way of thinking is behind the times.
The dogs barked all night.
I don't want to offend you.
I want to please you.
They made me do it.
Speak clearly.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Tom sat on the couch.
He wants to go to the United States.
Do you know anything?
You never stop, do you?
When did you hear the sound?
Your watch is on the desk.
She gave it her personal attention.
I just wanted to make sure I was right.
Tom could be a big help to you, I think.
I'll begin by asking a question.
You have a lot of nerve!
Some animals eat their young.
The Sahara is the largest desert in the world.

This was not supposed to happen.
Could you kill someone?
Nobody was able to suggest a solution.
Are you on the list?
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
I've tried everything I know of.
Tom can't swim.
I'm glad Tom was able to see you while you were in Boston.
He tried solving the problem.
I have many French-speaking friends.
There were many things that we needed to do to prepare for our trip.
Would you like tea or coffee?
You must certainly be very hungry now.
I don't know how to make you happy.
His story must be true.
There's so much I want to tell you.
Hold on a minute.
How about a cup of coffee? "I'd like to, but I have a previous engagement."
Tom was quiet all day.
I was on patrol.
You can't trust anything he says.
He came all the way to talk over a problem with me.
Would you like something smaller?
It has a flaw.

We're past that.
You are rich.
You don't have to apologize.
I don't want to see you here again.

You're very nice.
How dangerous is the situation?
He is at home today.
I work in the morning.
God bless you!
What have you come here for?
I'm stuck here.
It's no use thinking about one's lost youth.

I need you for a second.

That's not my opinion.
You're back again.
I beg your pardon.
This is what you've been waiting for.

I remember that speech.
I'm just worried about my weight.
I'm getting tired of this.
I have two brothers.
We're in need of help.
Why are you so busy all the time?
The view from this room is wonderful.
What if it's too late?
I would not go skating today.
Do you think anyone can see me?
He pulled my shirt.
The situation is under control.
You're welcome to stay with us as long as you want.

Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
You should get married again.
How could you know?
He told me about it.
It is cloudy today.
Tom didn't give me what I needed.
I don't like the polluted atmosphere of big cities.
Don't you care what happens?
If blaming me makes you feel better, go right ahead.
Can you do this problem?
Do you disagree?
There were about one thousand people.
I'm worried about them.

I remember when I first saw you.
Tom has achieved his goals.
It's no use asking me for money.

Did you pay for those shoes?
I'm totally confused.
I hope you have insurance.
I am looking forward to your letter.

Looking into the room, I found nobody there.
No one saw that.
They were on vacation last October.
Yesterday, my wheelbarrow was stolen.
Are you doing what you think is right?
I didn't even know that my car had been stolen.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
I'm trustworthy.

I think this medicine will do you good.
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind yet.
Who is that old woman?
I love to see you laugh.
I can't read your mind.
Don't make a decision right now.
It will be very, very hot.
He majored in drama at college.

I'm confused.
I don't ordinarily do this.

Tom is never alone.

Clean it up.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
Everyone was tense.
She came very near to being run over by a car.
I left my keys on the table. Could you bring them to me?
She held him by the sleeve.
The accident happened in this manner.
Don't get discouraged.
I'll give you a piece of advice.
Be merciful.
I need caffeine.
I asked Tom to lend me some money, but he refused.
Tom is trying to earn enough money to buy a new trumpet.
Both of my parents are not strict with me.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
I'd rather do this alone.
To tell you the truth, I'm completely bored.
Your paintings are beautiful.
Tom is doing a very good job.
I thanked Tom for his help.
It was raining last night.
We waited up for him until two o'clock and then finally went to bed.
I'm heartbroken.
This gun is reportedly very powerful.
You'll come back, won't you?
You shouldn't break promises.
I may not get another chance.
You're lucky you didn't die.

The answer is anything but simple.
Did you understand any of that?
We're not being sued.
Sorry, I can't help you.

His behavior disappointed many of his friends.
I just don't want to catch your cold.
You do that and I'll fire you.
Don't make me shoot you.
Would you like to take part in this risky experiment?
Follow my advice.
I couldn't get rid of my doubt about it.
That's what I was told three hours ago.
Tom promised never to do that again.
He hit me on the head.
Let's hope you're mistaken.
How long have you lived in Japan?
The worst thing you can do is to only do something half seriously.
Where did you find the key?
How is life treating you?
I'm determined to carry out this plan.
Nobody wants it.
Tom showed his room to me.
Tom is about as tall as Mary.
I suggest you listen carefully.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?
He always keeps his word.
She ran as fast as she could.
I told you that was just a joke.
I'm not sure that that's all true.
I had a good coach.
My grandfather was an archaeologist.
Bird watching is a nice hobby.
Please give me a cup of coffee.
Are you being followed?
I know you're busy, too.
The village is connected with our town by a bridge.
He did it willingly.
Wine is made from grape juice.
You will soon get used to speaking in public.
Tom is climbing a tree.
I never realized how hard it must be to be a woman.
We're both telling the truth.
They took a big risk.
How about sleeping at home?
I've always considered you a friend.
Three years have gone by since we got married.
I read some books.
How do I eat without a spoon?
I know that Tom is downstairs.
There is an urgent need for food and water.
I did not know this.
There's hardly any water in the bucket.
I was unlucky.
I'm looking into getting one.
Tom's fast.
What did they do to you?
You look nervous.
I think it's safe to assume Tom won't be here tomorrow.
The washer doesn't fit through the door.
Come and see me tomorrow.
Do you remember your grandfather?
Don't be deceived by appearances.
It's a questionable policy.
Is sugar a poison?
Everybody knows that he is honest.
Dinner is almost ready.
She looks very happy.
Write me.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
Don't ask.
I feel old.
I've always considered you a close friend.
What you are saying does not make sense.
You're on to something.
You still haven't told me who he is.
The important thing is that we're together.
They met on a blind date.
He is by far the wisest of the three.
How are things at school?
It's yours.
I considered that.
I'm offering you a job.
Do you come here often?
My life is such a mess.
Tilt your head to the side.
Why don't you go help Tom?
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
She saw him driving his new car.
It was her fate to die young.
Such incidents are quite common.
This is my favorite movie.
Stand up straight.
She has lived alone for ages.
Tom bought a box of candy to give to Mary.
You could hear a pin drop.
We're fighting.
Thank you very much for coming all the way to see me.
I feel really confident.
How would you like your coffee, black or with cream?
It's raining here.
A fallen tree obstructed the road.
I'm not taking my eyes off you.
She fell unconscious to the floor.
He has much more money than I have.
The event made him famous.
Do you want to go?
I don't want you to be hurt.
I don't think that's appropriate.
He's at church right now.
Even though he was tired, he went on with his work.
Spell your name, please.
We're going south.
What time did you wake up this morning?
I'm going to bed.
The high-profile kidnapping has captivated the nation.
That's not important for you to know.
Do you eat rice in your country?
You can't just come here without an appointment.
Can you excuse me a second?
Apparently I'm adopted.
That's one of mine.
You're very stylish.
Tom isn't so gullible.
I'm not sure anything happened.
Whose is this bag?
First, you must protect yourself.
The US is trying to extradite a drug lord from Mexico.
I'm not a gambler.
I'm tough.
You must take your parents advice seriously.
One language is not enough.
The place was packed.
He is accustomed to speaking in public.
I'd study harder if I were you.
That's pretty much all you need to know.
We were outnumbered.
I didn't know that you used to work here.
Which team will win the game?
Wow! It's been a long time.
I'll never leave you.
Rules are made to be broken.
We don't have anything to eat.
My grandmother has a green thumb.
She finished her errand and returned home.
Everybody in the village knew him.
I haven't seen you for a long time. Come and see me once in a while.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
I don't know that word.
Let's start with the easy questions, shall we?
London is among the world's largest cities.
How does it help us?
I wish you would do as you're told.
What was your relationship with your father like when you were a kid?
I showed the postcard I got from Mary to Tom.
It's all your fault.
I guess it shouldn't really matter.
I wasn't done.
Winter vacation is just around the corner.
That's all I need to hear.
I don't know why you don't like Tom.
The government has been reconsidering its firearms exportation.
They have access to the library.
How did you get acquainted with her?
I'll meet you at the usual place.
Did the police arrest Tom?
We've seen her.
The rent is paid for six months.
It was the best party ever.
They walked down the street singing a song.
They made him work.
We have no means of transportation.
This stone is too heavy to lift.
Tom borrowed my bike.
Tom didn't understand the joke Mary told.
Teachers should deal fairly with their students.
He's a foreign exchange student.
I think Tom needs something.
I want the truth from you.
I want answers.
I know where the money is.
You learn quickly.
I just want to get some sleep.
He's ready to go.
My association with him did not last long.
I'll attend the next meeting.
Nuclear weapons are a threat to all humanity.
I know that most people here can't speak French.
The readers cannot ascertain whether the news is true or not.
How did you get out of your room?
For that reason, he lost his job.
Sit here.
You're the last person I expected to see here.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
You're not allowed to go into that room.
There's no way I'm going to do that.
We're all impressed.
I hope you're all having a good time.
The doctor's on his way.
I think that maybe you're right.
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
You control your destiny.
I hate work.
He's waiting for you at home.
You're very talented.
Many runners passed out in the heat.
To improve your fluency, you should try speaking with native speakers as often as you can.
She had nothing to say about it.
I knocked on the door, but nobody answered.
Push the red button if something strange happens.
Visiting hours are almost over.
Maybe you don't know this, but nobody could ever take your place.
I don't like your going out alone.
Let's see if Tom can help.
Tom likes most of his teachers.
That's my final offer.
Do you guys want to read what I wrote?
She burst into tears.
I'll tell you what I know.
She answered my letter right away.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
You seem busy.
I love to see you smile.
She made me a cake.
I'll stay close.
Tom doesn't deserve this.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
Are you home?
Can they see me?
Tom doesn't want to give up his dream of becoming an astronaut.
Go away!
They're not going to give you this job.
The two teams fought very hard.
I was hoping you'd be there.
Life is too short.
The problem is that my son doesn't want to go to school.
Would you like to visit the city?
They have a large house.
The actress said that she was engaged to a banker.
That's peculiar.
Suddenly, it started to rain very hard.
Tom climbed into his truck.
Do you feel it, too?
It's time we went home.
Could you draw a map for me?
Be nice.
He doesn't remember anything.
I hope you'll soon get well.
She didn't like her husband.
The public bought it hook, line and sinker, didn't they?
We need to get you to a hospital.
I just got up.
Tom said he thought Mary was nervous.
How does it feel to be back?
Don't panic!
Go away!
Is that what you think I want to hear?
You're too slow.
I didn't think you were home.
I'm your best friend.
Tom fainted at the sight of the needle.
He fought against racial discrimination.
You can't handle this alone.
It's a no-brainer.
You can't go yet.
You know I have no choice, don't you?
What caused the crash?
It's a matter of time.
They won't find it.
We should use the fireplace tonight.
I'm busy, too.
Do you want your old job back?
Tom has nothing to lose.
He likes soccer.
The dress in the window caught my eye.
Thank you ever so much.
Take an umbrella. It's likely to rain.
This book contains forty photographs.
Did anybody see what happened?
They called them scalawags.
How's your old lady doing?
You should tell him the truth.
I don't talk like that.
Don't expect others to help you.
It is you who are to blame for the failure.
Excuse me, but I feel sick.
You're the only person I know besides me who likes medieval music.
I've had a tough day.
You can't prove a thing.
She gave me a present.
You must do it at once.
Your bicycle is better than mine.
I just needed some water.
I went for help.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
You don't sound convinced.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
He wishes he had gone to the theater last night.
I'd say you did well.
I have a dentist appointment.
I think there's something here you should see.
I don't hate you.
It's routine procedure.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
This house is far too small.
Cuff him.
On Sunday we were on the beach flying a kite.
Where on earth did you get it?
He declined their invitation.
I can't focus on two things at the same time.
It's dark in here. Do you have a flashlight?
Take care not to catch a cold.
I contributed.
Can I take a picture of you?
You are a prude.
When did you get married?
How did it go last night?
You're so sweet.
I looked, but I didn't see anything.
Tom is still driving a diesel.
The government must make fundamental changes.
Children should be taught to share.
I had a good teacher.
I don't need your protection.
Our teacher speaks French as well as English.
Can you jump over a chair from a standing position?
Is the world more mad than usual this morning?
Tom told me that he doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
I realize that this may sound crazy, but I think I've fallen in love with your younger sister.
Drastic times call for drastic measures.
Are you alone?
Your father's friends aren't his only supporters.
She took care of the child.
This clock seems to be broken.
You might not want to mention that.
They live downstairs.
Tom told me about Mary.
I really hope you can come.
I have to be careful.
What else did you eat?
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it.
Is that the new guy?
Tom should have been eating more vegetables and not as much meat.
It looks like you're trying to grow a beard.
How many of the words on this list do you know?
I refuse to discuss the question.
They're going to hang Tom.
All I know is that she left last week.
I played trumpet in our high school band.
I like that song.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
I have to do it again.
She is a real beauty.
How do you know all these things?
Are you seriously thinking about divorce?
I'm going to ask you to leave now.
Tom didn't do that very much.
Help us, please.
I don't know how to play mahjong.
Mary wants both a career and a family.
I promised I'd tell you the truth.
It was a secret.
I'll be seventeen next year.
Did you go out last night?
Please don't ask.
I'm always very nervous.
He has been living here these ten years.
I feel as if I were dreaming.
You always want to control everything.
Let us do the work.
I'm looking forward to that.
The door was difficult to open.
You don't have a lot to say, do you?
You will soon get to like her.
I guess I should've known Tom wasn't going to help.
You'd be perfect for that.
When did this come about?
I am going to the post office to buy stamps.
This building has five elevators.
I run every morning.
Give it to me.
The doctor advised me to take up some sport to stay in shape.
All those books are mine.
You may go in now.
I said I was busy.
What is his name?
The express arrives at 6:30 p.m.
Leave that box where it is.
I don't know your name.
We're all witnesses.
Don't look in my closet.
What don't you have?
It looks like something's going to happen.
It is getting darker. It may rain soon.
Could I get you to update this data for me?
Don't cheat.
You're kidding!
Are ghosts real?
This sounds like French.
The holidays came to an end at last.
We're proud of that.
She is Canadian.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
I gave a speech at the wedding yesterday.
The student made an irrelevant remark.
I haven't even told my secretary.
I am familiar with his music.
This is the most interesting book I've ever read.
I am not concerned with this affair.
The class went wild.
The weather is getting worse.
I'll be staying here for a week.
It smells bad.
Try another door.
You're a good guitarist. "I'd like to think I am."
I want my children to have dual citizenship.
I always obey the rules.
The first edition was published ten years ago.
There's a day left.
Are we disturbing you?
Don't go near the dog.
The bill, please.
Nobody is insulting you.
Do you have any idea what that is?
I don't need your money. I just need your time.
Are you the one who saved me?
We heard gunshots from next door.
I live just up the road.
He wants to kiss her.
His health has been getting worse since the accident.
He's too busy.
I bought a cactus.
What was that sound?
Are those explosives?
Mary wanted me to look the other way while she was getting dressed.
I'm going to need some more money.
Please don't make me laugh. I did too many sit-ups yesterday and my stomach muscles hurt.
She looked at him and knew that he was angry.
Lock the door behind me.
Are you coming in or not?
I know it's kind of late, but would you mind if I came over now? I have something I need to discuss with you.
Do you feel any better today?
I won't always be around to help you.
Everybody says that he's an effeminate guy.
Can you read French?
He had an accident at work.
I canceled my hotel reservation.
Can you guess the price?
I wonder if a human will ever be cloned.
Can I see that?
Your paper contains too many mistakes.
This broken vase cannot be repaired.
I feel sorry for you.
You don't seem too sure.
It's not secure.
Think about what you want.
Everyone knows that it wasn't your fault.
I'll set you free.
He is thick as a brick.
Can I take my shirt off? It's so hot in here.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
You are naughty.
She told him that she didn't love him.
I have a proposition for you.
Pink is not just for girls.
I see him in the library now and then.
Is this seat empty?
He wants to be a doctor in the future.
I have no idea why it is so.
I like your shoes.
I feel so cold.
It's a difficult language.
I think this is what you're looking for.
You like that, don't you?
Does he have to run so fast?
He gave me his word.
We'll go.
He cracked up.
What do you think I should pack for my trip?
Is your mother here?
Do you ever sleep?
Why didn't you just leave?
What exactly happened?
Tom made a list of what he needed.
He grabbed me by the collar.
I don't want to go.
Tom will never make it.
Have you ever thought about quitting your job?
Let me show you something really awesome.
Bad weather kept us from going out.
That's quite simple.
I sliced the apple.
Everyone looks the same, except the one standing on his head.
You overestimate him.
He always goes to work at 8:00 a.m.
He turned around.
It's too dangerous!
He lifted her in the air.
He should apologize for being rude to the guests.
We made sacrifices.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
In the north, it's cold in the winter.
Don't point your finger at me.
His project ended in failure.
I am thinking of going abroad.
I think maybe Tom and Mary should go.
It was very beautiful.
You need to wake up.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
We volunteered.
What have I done with my keys?
Are we going somewhere?
I think about them often.
It turned out that he was her father.
Did they hurt you?
I regret having neglected my health.
I need a few minutes alone.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I'll be nice.
You'll need a temporary bridge.
I learned a valuable lesson.
Tom was elected three times.
We have room.
The same goes for Tom.
I met him the day before.
Sometimes I don't get you.
Is she your mother?
I'm dissatisfied.
He finally achieved his goals.
That’s actually the truth.
What do you like about me?
I know Tom is psyched.
Why would you want me?
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
I'm tired of eating fast food.
I know you feel lonely.
She was the last woman that I expected to see at the party.
You should assume that email messages aren't private.
It's weird.
I want to see Boston.
He is going to the concert.
She was close to breaking into tears.
I'm sick.
Can I touch it?
He's not home.
That wasn't too bad.
I expected him to fail the exam.
Has he lived here for two years?
He took off his clothes.
I've never done harm to anyone.
We're looking for somebody who can speak French.
You were useless.
The TV program seemed very interesting.
The people he is living with in London are coming to see me.
I love you the best of all.
We're as good as dead now.
I can't understand anything he said.
In those days, few people went to college.
Do you know the man that's staring at you?
Do you want to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Don't just stand there.
You must be cautious.
I can't place him.
There's nobody home.
I still have mine.
What more do you want?
She can't do that.
I hate fluorescent lights.
One moment, they were arguing and the next they were kissing.
Since I didn't know what to do, I asked him for advice.
Neither one is acceptable.
Aren't you going to open the box?
Don't forget the receipt.
The concert has already started.
I'll look after my parents when they get old.
How's your boy doing?
My car is not running.
Your resume is very impressive.
She achieved remarkable results.
I have no clue what you're talking about.
I managed to acquire the book after a long search.
I'm feeling fine now.
What have you come up with?
It means a lot to me to know that you want me to stay.
She had a daughter by her first husband.
I've heard about it. Your parents disappeared, running out on their debt didn't they?
I told Tom to be home by 2:30.
I was sick, so I couldn't go to the concert.
Do you have a few minutes?
Tom was bleeding heavily.
We associate the name of Einstein with the theory of relativity.
Just as we are talking, there was a loud explosion.
I know Tom better than I know you.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to go.
I checked twice.
Can't you move faster?
Trust me on that.
When were you born?
I hope all your dreams come true.
It's a whole other ball game.
She laid her baby on the bed.
That's a relief.
Why don't you love me?
He sat next to her.
Children should not be spoiled.
I'm not the one who told Tom to leave.
I think we all know the rules.
That's my dog.
I wanted to see you.
Too many sweets make you fat.
You're winning.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
She made me a cake.
I think you should tell Tom you love him.
I have lost my camera.
There is a television in this room.
The man is starving.
I can't imagine myself doing something like that.
Someone opened the window.
I hope we can still be friends.
Are you afraid of it?
You must be cautious.
I'm in love.
I think it's OK.
It is what I would do.
Obviously, it's not working.
He pretended to be a doctor.
You don't need one now.
I can prove it to you.
I was unable to prevent this.
How will he pay his debts?
I think I might have a drinking problem.
You're very religious, aren't you?
You really should do that yourself.
Tom said he didn't even want to think about that.
All the ingredients are fresh.
I gave Tom a chance to work with me.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
When summer is over, the days grow shorter and shorter.
Tom no longer trusts Mary.
Pass the sugar, please.
I don't want to listen to you.
I want your opinion.
Is it you?
I just have to do something.
He gave him a book.
Why are you still here?
Tom lives in a cabin in the woods.
The cat is on the table.
I just did what you asked me to do.
I met your parents yesterday.
Tom isn't a parent.
We were shocked.
I told you it was going to be easy.
What is the latest news?
He keeps on phoning me, and I really don't want to talk to him.
I've been to Boston quite a few times.
He's such a sweetheart.
It costs 2 euros.
I paid.
Have you ever made a pie before?
Who is your favorite composer?
I fired the gun.
We picked the number at random.
I didn't tell Tom everything Mary asked me to tell him.
I like French food very much.
They handled it well.
Try to control yourself.
The murderer is still at large.
It's poison.
Everyone voted for it. No one voted against it.
I'm sorry if my words hurt you.
Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
I'd better call you back.
I go to a driving school.
Tom often goes to the movies with Mary.
Did everybody hear that?
I don't need a break.
He runs a shoe shop.
Did you write this fairy tale by yourself?
We were all on the bus.
Where did you go fishing?
Take it easy!
Who invented the telephone?
You were the one who gave this to me.
They go shopping.
I'm glad I invited you.
I just got there as fast as I could.
Have you already eaten supper?
She loves her children.
Let's unfold the map on the table and discuss it.
I didn't go to school because I was sick.
They accused me of being a liar.
You should listen to his advice.
I remember giving Tom some money.
That's precisely the point.
Why don't you help?
It's up to you.
It reminds me of the good old times.
All our food was rotten.
Who will you give the book to?
I saw Tom take your keys.
We had a fire drill yesterday.
Tom can't help me.
I know that Tom is a doctor now.
Answer Tom.
We had no problems at all.
What do you learn at school?
I'd like to have a cat.
I thought you'd say that.
We'll talk again in the morning.
Tom didn't go to the dance.
Who wants apple pie?
Your hand is as cold as ice.
If I had a dime for every time I heard that, I'd be rich.
Tom was murdered last night.
Both cases were dismissed.
He took a book from the bookshelf.
Let me help you clear the table.
You don't have to tell me this.
I have a prior engagement.
My dog is big.
The fire was extinguished at once.
You need to learn how to be assertive.
It happened so fast.
Do you think this rope is strong enough?
Please close the door when you leave.
I didn't know that Tom hated me.
Without you, I would've died.
I am moving next month.
Look at that big hammer.
Make me happy.
How much do you remember?
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark.
Get dressed quickly.
Tom will never agree to that.
I can't trust anybody.
No matter how hard he tried, my opinion didn't change.
She did pretty well.
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
I jumped for joy when I heard the news.
Humans can't live on Mars.
I really didn't want to play.
I can't believe I was so stupid.
We have achieved all our aims.
Are you getting tired?
How's your morning been?
I know you see it, but are you really looking at it?
I suppose I asked too many questions.
My job is to anticipate problems.
Can you take this call for me?
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
That can be confusing.
Your question has no answer.
I have a poor imagination.
Grab this.
Would you like to swap jobs?
I work at a language school.
What's the emergency?
You don't know what that means to me.
He found my bicycle.
That's icky.
Could we have a table in the non-smoking section?
I may outlive you.
She looks familiar.
I'll show you.
You'll strain your eyes trying to read in this light.
You should've seen the movie.
I don't have a choice. I have to do it.
Where is the difference?
We grew up together.
We lost all of our money.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
It looks like Tom is busy right now.
No one has ever complained about that.
Your mother and father are dead.
French is the language of love.
I need some blue paint.
Good job!
My husband is the jealous type.
Security was increased in the city.
At our high school, French is an elective.
As I was having lunch, the phone rang.
Commit these words to memory.
It's nice to be appreciated.
He was born in the 19th century.
I don't want to spoil the surprise.
Are there enough chairs to go around?
I can't afford to buy this.
We stood on the brink of a cliff.
I was the first to begin speaking.
I bought a new phone.
There are insects everywhere.
I'll keep you posted.
Tom wished Mary good luck.
Don't be so outraged.
The royal jewels are kept under lock and key.
You can't give up now.
Don't take this the wrong way.
That's the man whose wife died.
What's your favorite kind of candy?
Are you sure everything's OK?
He's on his way.
Do you know where the nearest American Express office is?
What do you want to do after you graduate?
How much do you remember?
That's OK.
I know Tom is overweight.
I'm a little rusty.
You have to resign.
I have been a teacher for 15 years.
It was just a dream.
That's pretty much everything you need to know.
How did you get into Harvard?
Tom is an electrical engineer.
My radio is broken.
You like it, don't you?
How often do you go abroad?
That one over there's really cute.
Termites eat wood.
I don't know about that.
When I'm hot, a glass of cool water really refreshes me.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
I am ready to follow you.
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that.
You might be correct.
I walked across the street.
He felt it was his duty to go.
He got a good grade in mathematics.
I remember seeing you last year.
Tom was beginning to feel ignored.
You screwed up.
She turned down my proposal.
I was a shy child.
Tom is the right man for the job.
Be nicer to your brother.
She lost her only son in the traffic accident.
She waited for him to come home.
I don't understand German.
I'm glad that you're here.
I thought a person like you would understand.
She went to see him the other day.
Don't act like that.
She read the poem out loud.
I can't believe you chickened out.
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
You have to ask me for it.
They like ragtime, jazz and music with a swing to it.
Many fantasy novels depict worlds with two moons.
I usually have dessert after dinner.
This is a pencil.
I don't know when it happened, but it happened.
They had fun with us.
I'll send you a picture.
Sometimes a nod is enough to show someone that you're listening attentively.
Don't you like us?
Sooner or later, I'll probably visit Boston.
My French teacher is the same age as me.
How many of the words on this list do you know?
I try to please everyone.
I think I'm right.
I'm not sure anymore.
The film had a great beginning, but the ending wasn't believable.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
He hasn't been doing anything since he graduated from high school.
Can you drive?
It's now a habit.
He began by saying that he would not speak very long.
I'd love to stay.
Can I meet you tomorrow?
I have no idea what to expect.
I can't open the door. Do you have the key?
That's the price of success.
I'll see you later, OK?
Maybe Tom's got something to hide.
Repeat after me.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
There is something you must know.
He couldn't get his ideas across to the students.
The pizza tasted good.
I don't want to listen to you.
You are very brave.
Tom is arguing with his wife.
I suggest you have a native speaker read over your report to make sure there are no errors.
Tom has been friendly to me.
They agreed on a price.
I've already paid you.
Do you eat spaghetti by twirling it around your fork?
What is the ultimate purpose of education?
Are you dressed?
I don't really feel like reading.
Look what I made for Tom.
I only found out about that today.
I had my doubts about you.
I can't walk anymore.
I don't like him coming to my house so often.
Am I boring you?
They'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway.
You're right, I think.
You can't be two places at once.
Please call me at my hotel later.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
The rest doesn't matter.
Tom should've invited Mary.
Is Tom drunk?
I think we should break up.
You need to be more patient.
That's very sweet of you.
Did you know this at the time?
That's a pretty good idea.
Nobody noticed that the picture was hung upside down.
You don't have to explain.
I'd like to reserve a table for two.
Tell Tom I'll be there as soon as I can.
The statue has no head.
Let's do this.
I hear his business is on the verge of ruin.
She helped me out countless times.
A dog bit her leg.
Tom didn't want to leave his dog with me.
He is armed to the teeth.
I'm sorry that happened to you.
She was my first girlfriend.
I remember meeting you before.
Something is wrong with the engine of this car.
Tom sipped some tea.
Please sing.
I wish none of this had ever happened.
I think I understand.
It is not until we lose our health that we realize the value of it.
I want you to teach me French.
Let's dance.
The answer was pretty astonishing.
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
They know what happened.
They handcuffed Tom.
This is a good place to camp.
I'm going to die.
I don't like this anymore.
It was light enough.
Please let me take your picture.
I know Tom is a bright kid.
Tom was awesome.
You're loaded.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
I don't want you to lose.
I don't know what I want to do yet.
I'm about to lose my mind.
The doctor persuaded him to give up smoking.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
We understand that completely.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I use it.
I'm nearsighted.
The more guests there are, the more difficult it is to keep a surprise party secret.
We hit it off right off the bat.
I am glad that you have returned safe.
At least you'll have something to write home about.
I thought about that.
I can't be seen with you.
Just pretend like everything is normal.
He had friends all over the world.
Could you please tell me again why you are late?
I am just going for a walk.
I'll handle the rest.
That won't work!
Don't let them go to waste.
I think we need a doctor.
What language were they speaking?
I hope you don't do that.
I know who asked you here.
She used margarine instead of butter.
Would you work for minimum wage?
That's not a bad start.
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius.
Please be polite.
I need subtitles.
You must have women throwing themselves at you all the time.
Tom seemed really worried about Mary.
We're in sync.
How do I turn this off?
Tom put the first aid kit back where he found it.
What time's your train?
I've drifted apart from my friends.
They are both unmarried.
What if someone sees it?
Tom looked like a weight lifter.
I'm unnecessary here.
That's exactly what I think too.
This house will rent easily.
My grandfather died when I was boy.
Didn't that strike you as odd?
I like you.
We are going to climb that mountain.
I've never been in love before.
I slept well last night.
Tom said you were lonely.
Don't you think it went great?
She gave me a doll.
They told me it was your fault.
Tom is supposed to meet me here.
I didn't understand what was happening.
He never told anyone.
Countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
Where did everybody go?
The flame went out.
I want to know what you're thinking.
Mom didn't mention it.
I reached the village before dark.
You look tired.
The fuel tank in the car is full.
He can hardly speak.
I'm not so old.
We were extremely fortunate.
Who does this dog belong to?
He lays on his back.
Somebody's in trouble.
Never ask a question if you aren't prepared to hear the answer.
Your name's further down the list.
Dad extended his legs on the sofa.
Meet me at the hotel bar.
They're all gone.
I paid 300 dollars for this guitar.
I thought you'd be happy.
That smells nice.
Finding a good place to live isn't easy.
Do you know where the bathroom is?
Tell me the truth.
You're in pain, aren't you?
Shouldn't you be in school?
She became a woman.
Tom folded his shirts.
Tom killed a man.
It was clear what he meant to do.
You're all done.
You had better read a lot of books while you are young.
I give up. No matter what I do, you never seem to be satisfied.
I can imagine how you felt.
The doctor monitored the patient's heartbeat and blood pressure.
Is that your cat?
They're hard to find.
I was always good at math.
Don't open the door for anyone.
I grasped the rope so as not to fall.
Who is this lady?
I read this book when I was in college.
I went straight to bed.
Help yourself to a drink.
There's a party tonight.
Is this your daughter?
Add a little milk.
The fence is painted green.
I need to get something to eat.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing in my apartment?
I forgot to bring the map.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
I miss you already.
I don't really like you.
What's the purpose of your trip?
She advised him of the date for the next meeting.
I took over my father's job.
I used to do that as a kid.
Give me a kiss.
I saw him go out.
Ask Tom where Mary is.
You lucky devil!
How much is the most expensive car?
I made a bad mistake.
I'm not overweight.
No one seems to know what this is used for.
Tom believes Mary is wrong.
I'll make you happy.
Do you have a tattoo?
It's hot down here.
They explored the Antarctic.
He had bruises all over after the fight.
He is very kind to me.
My neighbor is crazy.
Give me your address.
I'm sure she'll leave early.
Lemons contain citric acid.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
A year has twelve months.
What if somebody saw this?
Did you have fun last night?
He went there instead of his father.
We'll come to look for you.
He likes me and I like him too.
Don't look so suspicious.
We did fine.
I'm going to need some more time.
I wish I were wrong.
Let him in.
How did you get in?
I'm so tired.
I appreciate your trying to protect me.
She is holding her baby in her arms.
We have no extra money.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I want you to make a decision.
She's gone on a trip.
Just do the job.
They are all the same.
I lost my key somewhere around here.
I fed the dog.
He is sharp-witted.
Your car has a broken taillight.
The monkey got away.
I'm being harassed.
I don't know where that came from.
He married a pretty girl.
Leave me alone!
He is a good student.
Act like a man.
Should I ask her out?
That's not an option.
We haven't seen you in a while.
I'm tough.
How lucky we are!
She hit me, not him.
Are you feeling OK?
The microphone is dead.
I have a job for you.
Put the rifle down.
See you there.
It's nothing special.
I am ashamed of having been rude to her.
Your mother loves me.
Maybe I deserve this.
I was impressed.
You'll get into trouble.
The cat scratched my hand.
Did it make you angry?
The sea got rough, so that we had to give up fishing.
Where did you have your suit made?
I went to the park this morning.
This camera is the one that Tom bought last Thursday.
Everyone smiled.
Search every room.
You've changed since I saw you last year.
Didn't you feel like going?
I would've drowned if you hadn't saved me.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
Nobody invited me to the party.
I had my room cleaned.
Waiter, I'd like to order.
How big you are!
I like trying new things.
Don't screw it up!
Tom does that a lot better than I do.
She was able to answer whatever was asked.
We told everyone.
The summer is over.
You should make up your own mind.
I could not stand my house being torn down.
I'm committed.
Did you vote yet?
They took a big risk.
I need a miracle.
I need hand lotion.
You're wasting both of our time.
Do you like Moscow?
He is younger than me by three years.
No one can know everything.
He went to Paris at the end of May.
I hate milk.
Tom told me why he didn't want to go.
I could've done better, I think.
A spell of fine weather enabled us to get the harvest in safely.
Don't touch the button.
I had a nice long chat with my girlfriend's father.
Tom and Mary both said no.
Are they satisfied?
Dolphins are curious.
We've discussed this.
We should always obey laws.
All they had was one another.
I was very surprised at the news.
Have you ever been run over?
This is the largest dictionary there is in this library.
Aren't you satisfied?
I want to prove I can do this.
Last night my daughter didn't come home until half past one.
I've had coffee already.
Tom is no longer in our club.
It's rather ironic.
Are you busy right now?
Who would you recommend for the job?
Don't hurt me.
Have you given any thought to having dinner with me?
Why aren't you talking to me?
I could never do anything like that.
I didn't realize you were awake.
Those are Tom's cats.
I don't live with Tom.
He acts quickly.
Hey, it's not so bad.
I'm really looking forward to relaxing this weekend.
Once isn't enough.
I do it because I enjoy it.
Funny, I don't remember that.
What does the sign say?
We should get going.
Just tell me what to do.
I'm very drawn to you.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
He kept on writing stories about animals.
I just can't wait to do that.
Tom wanted me to walk home with him.
They say that he will never return.
Cut the red wire.
Is your father a doctor?
I've been working since six this morning.
Are you for or against the plan?
We are all alike, on the inside.
Don't look surprised.
Not a sound was heard in the room.
Do I have to undress?
Tell me what Tom said.
I want to eat some Korean food that isn't spicy.
Don't you think you have that backwards?
I know it myself.
What exactly is that?
What's your favorite song to dance to?
I know who you were with.
Please let me pick up your sister at the station.
I have a small favor to ask of you.
I don't like the way he talks.
Is the Orient too foreign for you?
Do you have enough blankets?
Are you going to sing with us?
Any teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.
I've done that myself.
My mom likes my brother more than me.
Our best friend is a doctor.
We have enough seats for everyone.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
The job of a driver is not as easy as it looks.
This is a great apartment.
In two days, I'll turn 13.
To the best of my knowledge, the lake is the deepest here.
I don't hold that against you.
I have to leave now.
He looks like his father.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
Is this cage shark-proof?
I want to go back home.
I'd like to thank you all for coming.
We'll have to pull an all-nighter.
Let's go away.
I figured I'd find you here.
How will I pay my debts now?
It is about time we were leaving.
I was terrified.
In general, little girls are fond of dolls.
I'm in bad trouble.
Faith is taking the first step, even when you don't see the whole staircase.
How nice to be in Hawaii again!
He took out a dollar from his wallet.
Will you take me home?
That's not my job.
I don't like people looking at me.
He gave me an example.
Nothing lasts forever.
You are fabulous.
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
The crops need rain.
How do you write your last name?
What is your decision?
He slept in the car.
We plan to go hiking tomorrow.
What should you do if you are bitten by a cobra?
The audience looked bored.
She watched him draw a picture.
I was chosen for that.
Dinosaurs died out a very long time ago.
Bad weather prevented them from sailing.
It was like something out of a nightmare.
I'm pretty sure that's Tom's goal.
I really can't make any promises.
Isn't life just great?
Tom was in trouble financially.
This article is of no value.
Sometimes cows are killed by coyotes.
This couch is not comfortable.
They work too much.
I got up early the next morning to catch the first train.
I will go if you go.
You have many books.
I wear my old coat in weather like this.
I don't know what it is, but it's something very big.
Of course she can speak English.
Tom threw something at me and I ducked.
Thanks for all you've done to make my special day such a memorable one.
We'll meet Tom tomorrow.
This book is of great use.
The tree fell down.
When did you notice that?
Tom isn't a doctor.
She was almost hit by a car.
I don't care about politics.
Could you turn on the light, please?
I have already read today's paper.
He's getting cold feet.
I know Tom was early.
She says she's not dating anyone now, but I don't believe her.
His teeth were white.
He doesn't lie.
I think that helps.
The person responsible has been fired.
My brother is a high school student.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
We long for peace.
I'm sure Tom was involved.
This road is very narrow.
You startled me!
There is an urgent need for blood donations.
Bad news travels fast.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
Are scientists close to cloning a human being? "Not by a long shot."
I am playing it safe.
He always mistakes me for my sister.
He turned pale at the news.
We need your assistance.
You were hurt, weren't you?
It cost me ten thousand yen to have my television set repaired.
Why are you saying that to me?
None of this makes any sense.
Why didn't Tom get on the bus?
Run for it!
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
She speaks English as if she were a native speaker.
It was so dark.
Sometimes it's better to remain silent.
I just don't believe you.
What does he intend to do?
Are you ready to go?
What time did you go to bed last night?
I don't expect you to be my friend.
Why are they so upset?
I like your cookies.
Congratulations!
Leave out this word.
It was very cold.
It's extremely ugly.
That's terrifying.
Why come to me now?
I really liked that.
I have no family.
Knowledge is power.
She spends a pretty good chunk of time just sitting there and looking out the window.
Don't worry. It's a common mistake.
She's inquisitive by nature.
I take it you know Tom pretty well.
I'd have waited for you.
That's his house.
I met him then for the first time.
They set up a new company in London.
Eat your peas.
Tom was worried about his grades.
I've got a big surprise for you.
You have to see it.
Exceptions prove the rule.
Should we tell everybody or not?
Which one will you choose?
I met Tom when I was thirteen.
Tom is in prison for a crime he didn't commit.
Fish live in the sea.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
What do you learn English for?
He changed schools last year.
In all likelihood, it will rain this afternoon.
My mother was crying.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Were you unhappy?
Tom is a gymnast.
Air is a mixture of various gases.
We sat in the front.
She spends over a third of her time doing paperwork.
I want a status report.
You're not allowed to go into that room.
We traveled together.
That's my chair.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
Tom made himself a drink.
A child is missing.
Please get in.
I'm leaving.
A ball is floating down the river.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
A rolling stone gathers no moss is a proverb.
I do not like him either.
I couldn't tell you why.
What else do we need?
Tom didn't mean it.
You're not the first.
Neither of these is mine.
I need a lawyer who can speak French.
I tried to save you.
You've got a lot of nerve bringing me here under false pretenses.
Be careful about what you eat.
We need your assistance.
He has started to write a novel.
I just kept my mouth shut.
Don't worry. I've already taken care of it.
How old are your kids?
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends.
He looks as if he had been ill.
I love you the most.
If you see a mistake, then please correct it.
Everybody knows I hate Tom.
I kind of messed up.
Tom asked Mary if she had to do that.
It's not that complicated.
My roommate complained about the noise.
I'll be glad to come.
I don't know how Tom got my phone number.
Are you listening closely?
Are you a criminal?
I need you.
He held out his hand.
They parted with a firm handshake.
There's no need to rush things.
You look busy.
I've done it before.
He pretended to be my friend.
She obeys him no matter what he tells her to do.
One of my children is sick.
Some day we'll take a trip to India.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
Don't you want to know?
There was no need to talk.
You are the kind of guitarist I like to sing with.
I don't see how that could be possible.
How do you live with that?
You're off the hook.
I've been accused of murder.
You're the leader.
Why do you have to be like that?
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early.
You're very efficient.
The event made him famous.
You are responsible for what you do.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
The meaning of this letter is unclear.
My tight wad husband took me to McDonald's for our anniversary.
I just need a little more time.
No man is wise at all times.
Are you awake?
We want to reach a wider audience.
He usually comes home late.
I love to read.
I have some good news for you.
They are the ones who want to go.
I don't like your name.
I've studied French.
Why are you so jealous?
I'll come by car.
You're not listening, are you?
Do you play in a band?
We're in love.
I met them last week.
I often visited the museum when I lived in Kyoto.
I don't even know how to dance.
I'm sorry about the way I acted last night.
You should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.
Where did you buy that shirt?
It's a piece of cake.
Tell me what you think's inside this box.
I would like to repay him for his kindness.
Tom isn't working.
Can you pass me the potatoes?
He speaks too fast.
I don't want to know what's going to happen.
Go up these stairs.
Tom walks quickly.
Are you going to cut down all these trees?
He died one year ago.
Tom's father left his family.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
I was Mr. Jackson's student.
The box was crushed during transport and the contents flew out.
I am totally confused.
I've never been in love before.
You're the one who planted that tree.
You will need an armed escort.
We'll shoot.
Why were you so slow?
I'll tell him when he comes here.
Would you like to leave a message for him?
Tom can be extremely dangerous.
It seems that you aren't having a good time here.
Have you been smoking?
We don't need you.
I want to read the book.
I don't know if I'm allowed to do that.
I just don't understand you.
He has very bad luck.
Everybody in the village looks up to him.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
It was very ugly.
Tom is at the doctor's office.
I'll give you back the money tomorrow.
Tom saw Mary leave.
The crocodile trapped the gnu as it tried to cross the river.
Didn't your parents teach you manners?
You stick out like a sore thumb.
The boy said that the taxi vanished into the fog.
You can't prove a thing.
Tom said that he was innocent.
I didn't want to tell you that on the phone.
He had the nerve to say that.
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
You must repay your debts.
A blind person's hearing is often very acute.
We'd like to give this to you as a token of our appreciation.
I'll tell you why.
Pizza is my favorite food.
Can you turn on the light?
What advice did Tom give you?
I never had to worry about money.
I'm surprised that Tom can't speak French.
What do you know about all this?
Japan's rice market is closed to imports.
I know I can trust you.
I'm still in love with Mary.
What has become of him since then?
Do you think that eating breakfast every day is important?
Which team is likely to win?
I answered the phone.
The more you explain it, the more I don't understand it.
She had no one to turn to.
Who's that girl?
They couldn't agree on anything.
You're faithful.
Mothers should keep their children from playing in the streets.
As a matter of fact, his lecture was boring.
I feel well today.
I know Tom might do that.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I'll ask my father for money.
Call off your dogs.
Let's hope that we don't have to do this again.
Tom wants to help, but he says he's too busy.
Are you still in love?
Start here.
Why should it be necessary?
We're quite drunk.
We should not have done that. It was wrong.
Don't change your mind.
I am very glad to see you.
Why can't I see you?
I told Tom that I was tired.
I wonder how Tom learned French.
Could you please be quiet?
You must think of your family.
At least try to come on time.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
That's where I work.
I wish to speak to Tom.
I know that you're vegetarians.
What are you doing this afternoon?
He acted foolishly.
He got angry with me.
I failed the exam because I didn't study.
I don't want to be tied to one company.
She made me hurry.
Who will help me?
Tom said he wanted to help us.
I told Tom that Mary was telling the truth.
You're not being rational.
Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
He may have lost his way.
She tried to persuade him to attend the meeting.
Welcome to your new home.
I actually think it's a very good idea.
They're looking for Tom.
Which club do you belong to?
Don't you hate it when that happens?
I wouldn't say that.
She looked at him with a smile on her face.
I know you are rich.
He could not stand being kept waiting so long.
He is more clever than me.
One out of 455 women doesn't realize she's pregnant until the twentieth week of pregnancy.
You're very stylish.
You've been busy, haven't you?
I want you to tell me about your trip.
Do you think he is a good driver?
What did you find?
Do you feel up to it?
Where can I buy coffee?
She appealed to me for help.
Don't you hang up on me.
Are you going to a movie?
It felt pretty good.
Tom doesn't have kids.
Maybe Tom has had an accident.
I'd like to pay by check.
Is there anyone else around?
I want you to be a bridesmaid.
He is our teacher and a person we should respect.
We spent the afternoon cleaning our gear.
She pushed him out the door.
He was in critical condition.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
You're too hard on yourself.
I'll use magic on him and turn him into a frog.
Can I sit with you?
Are you still upset about what happened?
The living room in my new house is very large.
Maybe I should have spoken with Tom.
I can't believe that we've actually done this.
You're losing.
I know the subject well.
I love your dress.
It's going to be great and exciting to be there.
Get your clothes on.
I usually go to bed at nine.
Tom is a single father.
You're the one that went crazy.
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen.
Don't get all high and mighty.
That was a stupid thing to say.
I told them to study more.
He is a man of ability.
It is strange that you should know nothing about the matter.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
This CD belongs to her.
That's really pathetic.
You're very clever.
We're very serious.
Why is it that she looks so sad?
It feels weird.
I'm sure he mistook me for my sister.
I ought to go.
You are the one.
I didn't go.

Do you have one a little smaller?
Are you hurt?
I've never been in trouble with the law.
It is under the chair.

You've got to be bold!
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
What a lovely dress!
My mother called me.
Would you like it washed?
I don't want to go bald when I'm still young.
We're both planning to be at your party.
There's nothing wrong with that, either.
I want you to understand this isn't going to be easy.
Why did you tear the cloth instead of cutting it with scissors?

Are you off your rocker?
Where can we get what we want?

I've already finished reading this book.
That's one of mine.
He showed it to me.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Is it a yes or a no?
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
I hope you have brains enough to see the difference.
He aimed at the bird.
He loved me, but he doesn't love me anymore.
Tom'll understand.
We've all seen it.
What's your friend's name?
I need to be alone.
You don't sound so sure.
Do you think I should write to Tom?

I think you are mistaken.
I recognized her as soon as I saw her.
That problem isn't important.
I made an effort to finish my work.
We're not breaking anything.
That's a risk.
I'm finished.
Why didn't you say that before?

I've never been there myself.
We'll see what the judge has to say about that.
I can't find the right man for me.
You're not a very good liar.
This hut is a very special place.
I wanted to know what happened.
Are you sure you're up for it?
He was the sort of man you could get along with.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
That's a really good painting.
I never thought about it.
Are you sure?
That's what I thought you meant.
I can't believe we won.
I don't like his way of talking.
There was fear in his eyes.
Call me up at seven in the morning.
Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself.
I expected you to be here for lunch.
I can hear you loud and clear.
Tom was late for dinner.
I felt quite relieved after I had said all I wanted to say.
Monday was a busy day.
Give me an example.
Do you drink green tea?
This one is special.
I'd like to spend more time with you.
I have an orange and an apple.
You ran a red light.
I wanted to see what would happen.
I didn't run away from home.
You are too young to travel alone.
Why did you buy a car?
I was late for school yesterday.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice sat around the fire.
I've got to get going.
All the doors of the house were closed.
Luckily, we have a plan.
I have a lot of things to do.
Tom is a nice guy with a big heart.
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
I must run.
How many times have I told you to fold your clothes?
She was too tired to keep on working.
You never know what you can do till you try.
I've got a bad hangover.
One of the apples fell to the ground.
You should have introduced yourself to the girl.
That's a puzzle.
We've been warned.
I promised to help my brother with his homework.
His word is law.
He always relies on other people.
My teacher told me that I should have spent more time preparing my presentation.
Tom bought himself a watch.
Are you courageous?
The fact was of interest to the scientists.
Tom likes swimming.
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
Is that clock working?
I think it's reliable.
I could fire you for that.
You're a pig.
The talks will deal with the problem of pollution.
Tom stopped at a convenience store to buy some milk.
I'm really not supposed to do this.
She asked me how old I was.
I took a taxi to the train station.
I want to share it with you.
I don't take any medication.
When you've finished reading that book, I'd like to read it.
I wonder what Tom thinks.
I hear she is going to get married next month.
I doubt if he will succeed.
Don't make me kill you.
I know you're not coming to my party, but I wish you were.
I want you out of my room.
He asked for some money.
I'll grab it.
That poor family survives on food stamps.
Who were you looking for?
I wonder why Tom won't talk to me anymore.
I only came to say I'm sorry.
I forgot my password.
She is very shy and feels ill at ease at parties.
What do you say we go skiing?
One of the girls was left behind.
The baby smiled at me.
He jumped out of bed.
Stand aside.
Soon nobody will have anything to do with you.
Tom rents rooms to students.
I found the picture you were looking for.
Have you read today's paper?
But don't you think that it's a little big? asked the shopkeeper.
You don't look very good.
When did the accident take place?
We're sneaky.
The girl has no mother.
My father won't allow that.
Go on.
I want your opinion.
Tom always makes it a rule never to ask a woman her age.
I remember playing the original Pac-Man game when I was a kid.
They found no such proof.
Did you hear that a burglar broke into the neighbor's house?
Who gave you permission to do that?
I brought a salad.
Tom slipped and nearly fell.
How many countries are in Africa?
You're very funny.
You're testing my patience.
Getting up at six o'clock is okay for me.
Don't put anything on the box.
How much is it going to cost?
Tom doesn't want Mary to participate.
You look like Tom's wife.
We hope to finish planting the field before the sun sets.
You have two balls.
You're not being rational.
The weather changed suddenly.
He's very upset by this.
That was really difficult.
Stop screaming like a girl.
Tom's eating.
I feel their pain.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
How did you get interested in art?
How do I get a hold of you?
You're not a millionaire.
He has little money with him.
What is it you do for a living?
Move over.
The house was more expensive than I had expected.
This offer is available for five days.
Tom said that he didn't know Mary's address.
I don't have time to talk to you now.
I know all that.
Let's try to make Tom laugh.
What're we looking for?
Tom is swimming in the river.
That sounds outrageous.
You look like you're busy.
I don't remember your name.
Every school kid has played hooky at one time or another.
The three were arrested.
The trip was amazing.
Tom wasn't complaining.
I hear that his father is abroad.
I'm attentive.
There are cookies in the oven.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't have a brother.
Was she able to write a report?
Tom works for me now.
I'm ill.
I glanced through the brochure.
I'm homeschooled.
This is the least expensive method of all.
I study math harder than English.
I always take a bath before going to bed.
The boy lifted the heavy box with one hand.
Stop being so nice to me.
He has many talents.
He looks like a monkey.
She whispered it in my ear.
What do you say to going out for a short walk?
I suggest we all calm down.
They are probably all dead now.
Don't interfere in others' affairs.
Don't you see what that means?
No one escaped alive.
She startled him.
I need someone to hold me and tell me everything will be alright.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice are all Canadians.
It is up to you to decide what to do.
I'm glad I invited you.
You're going to want to see this.
It is difficult to shoot a bird flying in the air.
I am going to Osaka station.
The old castle is in a sad state.
I don't have a girlfriend anymore.
I had a hard day.
She made the same mistake again.
I still love the way you smile at me.
I don't agree with segregation of people by race.
It's all coming back to me.
See you soon!
What happened exactly?
When I was a boy, I always got up early.
I love the sound of rain on the roof.
I didn't want to disappoint my parents.
I must go alone.
We can't let this continue.
We know all about you.
I've got two brothers.
Tom doesn't like to travel.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I don't know whose umbrella this is.
There are no examples.
What'll you be doing over the weekend?
I don't know him.
Her silence surprised me.
I'm not giving you any money.
This isn't mine.
He is the man you met the other day.
She was unkind to him.
I sometimes wish I could live a quiet retired sort of life but I doubt I could stand it for more than a few days.
I go where I'm told to go.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
I have to do this.
It just came out.
Why did you call?
The flowers will brighten up the table.
I'm glad you're OK again.
That was no accident.
I punched his jaw.
You can't carry on like this.
She has a comfortable income.
My girlfriend is a good dancer.
None of them are present.
You've hurt me a lot.
Tom still doesn't know who's going to be there.
You may go.
Her uncle is a famous doctor.
I love libraries.
I take it for granted that you will join.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
You must tell me.
Just remember I dropped everything to be here for you.
Give me a piece of paper.
Could I see you tonight?
So, what else is going on?
Rabbits are extremely social animals.
I'll just have one or two beers.
I think this is mine.
My car is parked outside.
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
I have a laptop.
You're not from around here, are you?
Everybody's got something to hide.
It's slightly windy.
I'm from Romania.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
What do you want to be?
Are you still upset about what happened?
Do this work by tomorrow if at all possible.
Bad weather upset our plans to go on a hike.
You don't look well.
Well? Will you come?
I've made up my mind to come up with a better solution.
Don't be shy.
I wonder what's going to happen to us.
I hear with my ears.
Who will write the report?
Where were you three years ago?
The public is clamoring for more jobs and lower taxes.
Please let me try it again.
Tom lives around here somewhere.
Are you old enough to drive?
Many consumer reviews on Amazon are fake.
He is not what he used to be.
Christmas is just around the corner.
I hope to one day speak German as well as you speak English.
You'd better not eat too much.
I know Tom is frantic.
You have brought shame upon our family.
We play games together.
Are you looking for someone?
Do you have any drinks?
She has a good figure.
Mary's husband abused her.
Can you save this seat for me?
I do sympathize with you.
Tom couldn't finish his dinner.
I study French at home.
Would you like to go on a trip together?
This isn't enough.
Tom dyed his hair the same color as Mary's.
I guess that she is over thirty.
I don't know why you're all so angry.
The check, please.
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
I know that you don't speak French very well.
He began to work to get Congress to reduce taxes.
I'm going to regret this.
Write with your left hand.
Don't ask questions, just come with me.
Do you like this?
Why didn't you listen to me?
They aren't going to help Tom.
Nice to meet you, said the businessman.
Do you need help?
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow.
We're shaken.
I'm not your baby.
Do you teach?
We tried to get him to change his mind, but couldn't.
I study math harder than English.
There was a loud explosion.
I don't blame you for doing that.
He likes all animals except horses.
I come here every Fourth of July.
I leave it up to you.
Tom still lives at home.
Not all change is bad.
He went to see her the other day.
Are all the windows shut?
He loves coffee.
I liked it.
I had a call from her for the first time in a long time.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
He lost his memory.
I go to the barber once a month.
He is fond of this kind of music.
Tom found a place to live.
Stop yelling at me.
I'm going to swim every day.
There was a thick fog.
I was skeptical at first.
You need to have breakfast.
Lock your doors.
I want to play cards.
What answer did you come up with for question three?
I'd be grateful.
This could have unintended consequences.
I'll live on welfare.
Well, have you decided?
I went to the park yesterday.
I liked that song.
Shut the door tight.
We need something to eat.
I don't have all day.
We're sinking.
Do you know how to program?
This store sells old books.
I want to see what happens.
Tom likes rock.
She heard him sing.
Please be polite.
Fortunately, she didn't die.
You're back late. What have you been up to?
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
Tom hesitated.
I thought you'd be older.
I suggest that you go by train.
We all quit.
I bet you're busy.
I have a date on Friday.
I'm adamant that you should go.
Turn the lights out now.
There is a knife missing.
I am willing to help you.
I love the way Tom thinks.
Please accept my sincerest condolences.
He said he would give us his decision for sure by Friday.
Someone must have left it there.
I know that Tom likes basketball.
You knew I was married.
How are things at work?
I often hear her refer to her childhood.
The sun is about to set.
I do hope you understand.
What did I win?
They let me go.
I had a premonition that this would happen.
My sister is younger than me.
We're doomed.
How will I pay my debts now?
He will be busy tomorrow.
Mr. Jackson is a great teacher.
I don't know how to play chess.
Do you believe this is true?
How did you find us?
Is that why you want to kill me?
Tom said that Mary looked skeptical.
This is your lucky day.
I contributed.
Judging from his appearance, he may be a soldier.
I'm the type who likes to think things over very carefully.
We helped them out when we could.
I can't imagine what life would be like without you.
What are you doing in Boston?
I really wish I could do more.
You don't know Tom as well as you think you do.
I thought you'd be grateful.
She pinched him.
She had white shoes on.
I just did what anybody would've done.
It's artificial.
The baby cried.
I thought you were older than me.
I have hardly any English books.
Food is still scarce in the region.
Why were you so busy yesterday?
They were not impressed.
She went on a picnic.
He shouted, "Get out!"
Tom is a famous singer.
It doesn't need to be done right away.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
The leaves fell to the earth.
I don't think children should drink beer.
As far as I know, he's a diligent student.
Our mountains aren't really very high. Yours are much bigger.
My sister has a sweet tooth.
I feel so embarrassed.
Think about what you want.
You haven't washed your hands yet, have you?
The air conditioner seems to be working now.
The princess was beautiful beyond description.
Do your own job.
It's out of the question!
You are late.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
It's kind of embarrassing.
What part of Australia are you from?
He wants to speak.
It was such a hard test that we did not have time to finish.
Where did you go to school?
I'll get there before you.
You're very fortunate.
They're broke.
Why don't you play something for me?
They're not happy.
Leave the door open.
Go to the store and buy us some food.
You have to tell me the truth.
She is drunk with happiness.
I had something else in mind.
How was the flight?
There's no use making excuses.
I feel fine now.
I just want to say I love you.
I thought he was honest.
Tom is calling us a taxi.
Where is the police station?
Read as many books as possible.
I think everything is under control now.
Tom didn't want to sit next to me.
What can be the meaning of this?
I'd like some water.
It was raining last night.
Nobody speaks to me.
This is insulting.
I could smell the alcohol on his breath.
What are you supposed to do?
It's just a formality.
I know that she has been busy.
I really need to sleep.
Didn't they teach you anything at Harvard?
That is the office where he works.
She had a little money.
He's a biologist.
He was watching television all day.
Riding a unicycle is one thing I'm not very good at.
Tom got to the station too late, so he missed the train.
I want to live.
You can go from Washington to New York by train.
How fast can you do it?
This is a mistake.
The roads are slippery, so please be careful.
You are no longer welcome here.
He ripped up all her letters and photos.
They stopped laughing.
If you ever come to town, come to see me.
Could you check this for me?
What does what happened last night have to do with what's happening today?
Whose book is this?
He stopped talking.
I want each of you to tell me exactly what you did last weekend.
It is high time you went to bed.
I don't do this for the money.
Do you play soccer every day?
I have nothing to report so far.
I've thought of it a lot.
I explained the rules of the game to him.
What keeps you going?
I love winning.
The company accepted his application.
Forget it!
A big bomb fell, and a great many people lost their lives.
He is by far the best student.
I hate weddings.
You said you didn't care.
This is from Australia.
Trade between two countries can be complex.
I'll be whatever you want me to be.
I know you helped Tom.
I can't agree with you on this matter.
You're all alone.
She married a sailor.
How's your project coming along?
He is a psychic.
In the early days of American history, blacks lived in slavery.
She cursed him for causing the accident.
I don't remember anything happening.
He doesn't get along with anybody in the office.
We did not expect him to finish the task in so short a time.
I was stupid enough to believe Tom.
They handled it well.
He emphasized the importance of peace.
I was momentarily blinded.
Why did they hire you?
I love listening to you guys sing.
I'm not bragging.
You're a terrible person.
I stopped and gazed at them.
He took his book.
I'm here if you need anything.
Tom and Mary are really good friends.
They jumped through a window into the river.
That's weird.
I don't feel like joking.
You're forgiven.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
What time do you go home?
Thousands of satellites orbit around the earth.
Would you mind if I have a look?
I didn't steal it. You can check my pockets.
I want to understand why this happened.
Rome is an old city.
I suppose that's OK.
Too many sweets make you fat.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
No wonder they have elected him chairman.
I admit I wasn't sure.
It's broken.
A fierce battle was fought by the soldiers.
I brought reinforcements.
Please take good care of yourself.
Let me get my wallet.
I'm being promoted.
We can't afford this.
I want to hear what everyone has to say.
There's no danger.
Do you recognize that man?
The policeman captured the man who was running.
Can you light the way?
We're careful.
I'm going to fly to Australia.
Tom showed Mary how to boil water in a paper cup.
You don't look Japanese.
I know that you still think about me.
The boy looked into the room.
Yesterday I listened to a very beautiful song.
I'm looking for an easy-to-read manga with furigana.
I was disgusted.
She doesn't eat meat, does she?
You can't tickle yourself.
I'm not well.
The president governs for four years.
You know what they say.
You don't seem tired at all.
Is Tom a Christian?
Forgive Tom.
What a great idea!
I don't know what to do about it.
She was always quarreling with her parents.
When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room.
Stop fooling around!
Guess what I did last night.
I can squeeze you in.
This is sabotage.
That boy is very clever.
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake.
They were scolded by the teacher.
You have no alternative.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
I figured you'd be impressed.
It began to rain, so he did not have to water the lawn.
How did you know what I was going to say?
Where is your money?
I was at the party.
Tom knew he'd just made a huge mistake.
Tom wasn't serious, was he?
Each of the three boys won a prize.
It was there yesterday.
They died one after another.
There's a general sense that something should be done about unemployment.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
I think we've done a pretty good job so far.
They strolled along the beach.
I don't want to be your enemy.
Do you know who we are?
It cost $300 to get the car fixed.
We need to cut costs.
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
The violence lasted for two weeks.
All of you look healthy.
May I sit here?
Last night, I read a book.
I think we should make a deal.
Tom filled out the form.
Here is our answer to your fax message dated April 1st.
According to the thermometer, it's thirty degrees.
Are you ready?
I never want to see you again.
What's your plan?
It's like one of those.
Do you know what's in those containers?
English is studied in China, too.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
You shouldn't have done it.
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
You'll have to take his place in case he can't come.
I'm fed up with your constant complaining.
A girl can dream, right?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
The paint was coming off the wall.
That is a very good question.
Who are you texting?
You may not like it.
I think those are the best.
He's my partner.
She returned to Japan.
I don't follow.
I don't have a guitar.
She must have taken the wrong bus.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
I practice the piano every day.
Are you implying something?
I failed chemistry.
He is not scared of snakes at all.
I want to know where they are.
I owe you a beer.
I learned from the best.
Wait, it could be dangerous.
I love the way you talk.
Tom wasn't wearing a helmet.
Tom coughed.
Tom said you wanted to see me.
She isn't fit for the job.
That's a very personal question.
I know whether or not he is an enemy.
I don't want you to worry about anything.
Where did you learn this?
I'm feeling kind of sleepy.
How do you know that you don't need a bodyguard?
Take all the time you want.
My left hand is numb.
You got here on time.
This is the only tie I have.
They apologized for the inconvenience.
When did I say that?
I'm serious about my job.
What's all this stuff?
They've missed the boat.
Fix this.
In order to swim, you have to learn to tread water first.
Sleep tight.
Do you want to stop?
I think it's time for me to split some more firewood.
This is the last time I'm telling you to do that.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
Did you see that car?
Did you learn to swim when you were a child?
You're not dead.
Think of your future.
Do you know what he said?
The dog sniffed her luggage.
Accidents happen all the time.
I don't like scary movies.
Fill out this form.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
This desk is different from the one I ordered.
Are you all set for the trip?
We're not fighting.
It's cheaper to order things by the dozen.
As far as I know, there is no such word.
He was too angry to speak.
Come off it!
I appreciate your support.
How about running?
The meat is tough.
Aren't you satisfied?
You're driving too fast.
They can't hear you.
Don't tell my wife.
Tell Tom to shut up.
Step inside.
She asked me to open the window.
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.
No one will speak with me.
I'm untalented.
We can talk about it later.
Why are you so sad today?
I want one, too.
He left the door open.
I really hate dairy products.
Turn up the volume.
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
Where's the nearest museum?
I just want you to know that I regret it.
She has small feet.
Attack!
I'll keep Thursday open for you.
Do you mind if I open the door?
What kind of shampoo do you use?
Do I look pale to you?
I bought Tom a hot dog.
Give me back my bag.
Time is more precious than anything else.
Mother prepared lunch for me.
You should have seen him.
My father is coming home tomorrow.
The matter is all settled.
His hair has turned white.
Why is alternative energy important?
Why is he asking me that question?
He was persuaded to change his mind.
We can't find a good sewing machine anywhere.
Tom was poor.
Tom got up to help Mary.
He glanced at her and saw she was angry.
She will soon clear away these dishes.
My advice wasn't followed.
Don't act surprised.
I got on the wrong train.
Do you like French wine?
He's about to go.
Ask her when she will come back.
Do they know about us?
I need a raise.
She greets him every morning.
The nation was growing.
You may bring your own lunch to school.
I'm the spokesperson for this organization.
Tom told me later that he wasn't really married.
I'm getting little pimples on my face. I wonder if I've been getting enough sleep lately.
This is my mother.
My sister takes a shower every morning.
The school was established in 1650.
Tom gets angry very easily.
There are too many of us to fit into one taxi.
Do you like the way you look?
I like taking walks.
The ball rolled across the road.
You know very well what I want.
I begin this afternoon.
My answer is enough.
I want to take a walk.
Tom and Mary have only two children.
Did you bring a weapon?
Tom and Mary became lifelong friends.
Why hasn't Tom come back yet?
Turn off the light.
We're from the same neighborhood.
He stopped reading the newspaper.
One mouse is running around in the room.
I no longer love you.
We got a little bored with each other.
He sleeps during the day and works at night.
I finally found a place where we can be alone.
I wasn't busy last week.
Please correct me if I make a mistake.
It seems that everyone's having fun.
Eliminating the deficit will be a very difficult job.
You touched my heart.
I didn't have time to do everything that needed to be done.
I forbid you to go there.
Did you call the plumber?
Shall I close the window?
Employers sometimes exploit their workers.
I thought you told me you didn't know Tom.
The rent is very high.
Can I get a minute with you?
It was easy for him to solve the problem.
I think I'm on the wrong bus.
I know how to fly.
Act your age.
Ask me a question.
I want to hear who won.
You have to begin as soon as possible.
Do you have your keys?
Don't worry, I'm going to help you.
You aren't looking.
We really need to win.
Take your time. We have all afternoon to shop.
You should learn from your mistakes.
Death is often compared to sleep.
I am frying fish.
What other movies did you watch?
You really don't need to do that.
Germany shares a border with France.
You like rain, don't you?
Have a good Christmas.
He is the only child they have.
What's the score?
I want to go.
Here's the bill.
Look, I'm being serious.
I'm glad you see it that way.
I cannot do without this dictionary.
They were swimming.
I have an exam on Monday.
Sulfur is used to make matches.
She bought a shirt for him.
He was aware of my presence but he did not greet me.
I saw you doing that.
I saw you at the flower shop.
They felt sure of success.
I need you to go home.
I was born on October 10, 1972.
The Battle for Belleau Wood lasted three weeks.
I talked to the girl you told me about.
Is it that difficult to understand?
I know Tom is about my age.
I couldn't catch what he said.
Tom didn't scream.
Come over for dinner sometime.
Are you kidding?
Can you help me to learn French?
Don't you remember my name?
He locked himself in the bathroom.
Would you excuse me?
I can't wait to meet him.
You are in part responsible for it.
Your answer is wrong.
In those days, I used to get up at six every morning.
Since there were no taxis, I had to walk.
I never told you to quit.
That's my goal.
Leave that to me.
There's nobody home.
Say which you would like.
Sound the alarm!
She invited me to the ballet.
Do you want to see some magic?
I rented out the guest bedroom.
She took care of his wound.
You guys are dangerous.
I would prefer any alternative to a lawsuit.
I got lost three times.
The newspaper is by your side.
Now it's your turn.
A new model isn't necessarily any better than the older one.
Somebody stepped on his foot.
You mean the world to me, you really do.
This is the key that opened that door.
Police arrested one man.
I think that was Tom.
I've lived a hard life.
You're smarter than me.
I borrowed the screwdriver from a friend of mine.
What kind of mistakes did you make?
One of the teenagers screamed.
She got brushed aside.
Tom said he had more important things to do.
You are early.
Bring me the phone, Tom.
Are you sure that's safe?
My uncle came to see me.
I'm seriously considering moving to Boston.
Why is this light blinking?
Fur coats are on sale.
The new medicine saved his life.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
There is a long wait between trains.
She wore a long, loose coat.
You don't look like a millionaire.
Be careful or you'll strip the gears.
Give me a hint.
I just want to be normal.
He returned home for the first time in ten years.
Don't ask for money.
I have to solve this problem.
I read all kinds of books.
We'll miss Tom.
I wanted to make you feel at home.
Fire is dangerous.
The moon moves around the earth.
You should not wear a fur coat.
Tom has made a decision.
Where is your cap?
You need to redecorate your room.
This made me very sad.
Those two are exactly alike.
This isn't supposed to be happening.
It's somebody else's turn.
It's a cautionary tale.
How can you be so optimistic?
We grow wheat here.
He's hopelessly in love.
Tom got back in the car.
Tom should have followed Mary's advice.
How much were the glasses?
Things are starting to get interesting.
Can you slow down a little?
The hunters aimed at the elephant.
She wants to marry her daughter to a doctor.
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was born in a log cabin in Kentucky.
Tom says he's read this book three times.
Few people are on a first name basis with the president.
When was the last time you saw the cat?
Let him go.
We're completely lost.
I don't know about you, but I feel pretty good today.
It's a parody.
None of this makes any sense.
Tom thought that Mary loved him.
Stay positive.
He denied having said such a thing.
It's so hot outside, you could fry an egg.
I've got a pair of sunglasses.
Tom doesn't want to go out.
It was only a dream.
Tom doesn't know where to begin.
She shouldn't go by herself.
We have things all worked out.
After we walked for a while, we got to the lake.
He told her that she was right.
He's allergic to cats.
Don't forget to answer his letter.
Turn on the TV.
They can't hear me either.
You go first.
Where did you get this list?
She spread a beautiful cloth on a table.
Smoking will do you a lot of harm.
Can anyone vouch for your whereabouts last night?
When Tom died, I wanted to die.
Everyone is angry.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
Is he a hardworking student?
We picked the number at random.
Whose guitar is this?
I think Tom is almost deaf.
He has been in Japan for three years.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Do what you think is best.
I'm stuffed.
Has he gone already?
I became a director.
He was a former university professor and researcher.
Everyone should have a hobby.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
I'm an innocent man.
You deserve a pay raise.
He asked for a pay raise.
He's writing his diary.
At the start of every weekend, I am both tired and happy.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
Tom is the tallest guy I've ever seen.
Winter is coming.
I thought you might need help.
When is Tom arriving?
I hate pretending I'm interested.
I've never been abroad.
You need to save the princess.
Humans are the only living creatures that make use of fire.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
Tom cut down the tree with his chainsaw.
Come soon.
I watch television after supper.
Write to Tom.
My mother has sold everything that is dear to her.
Have you found your contact lenses?
Who invited you guys?
No one wanted to insult these men.
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen.
I'll be discreet.
He is a nice person.
I never for a moment imagined that I would still be doing this kind of thing at my age.
Everything is negotiable.
Do you plan to stay long?
It was a beautiful wedding.
He is a teacher.
I tried in vain to persuade them.
He came after everybody had come.
You're an artist.
I've seen it a million times.
Where are you going with this?
Tom spent three years in prison.
While napping, I had a strange dream.
It used to be nearly impossible.
Are you sure you're all right?
We're all done.
Many people do this.
You need to stay awake.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
That's really nice.
They abandoned the ship.
I'm going drinking with some of my friends tonight.
How lucky you are!
I know Tom is unemployed.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
My favourite game is football.
I'll prove it.
I'd like to stay here a little longer.
All the leaves on the tree turned yellow.
I'm going to see him tomorrow.
Do you have anything to say?
It's a family secret.
We have enough time to catch the train.
I've had enough of your excuses.
I really wasn't expecting that from you.
I just want to get married.
Your request is denied.
I hate it when there are a lot of people.
The British people turned to a new leader, Winston Churchill.
Japan has undergone a drastic change as a result of industrialization.
I'm interested in mountain climbing.
Don't cut that wire.
We need to protect ourselves.
What is your first name?
I recovered.
I would like a glass of water.
I told the children to be quiet, but they just kept on being noisy.
Feel this.
I feel strongly about this.
She decided to have surgery.
You forgot to buy lettuce.
Buy me a drink.
It's not as easy as you think.
I didn't feel like going out this evening.
What's your favorite breakfast food?
They're eating apples.
She watched him swim.
None of us saw it.
Do you live in this dorm?
I guess I haven't made myself clear.
I guess you think you're pretty special, don't you?
Thank you for all you did for me that time.
I like the way you look.
You're not the only Canadian here.
Tom didn't see the stop sign.
I want to talk to you after class.
Tom never learned how to read and write.
You obviously don't live here.
Are you sure they can do this?
America is often referred to as a melting pot.
I think you'll find this interesting.
That's what I did today.
I think that they were all fired.
Be discreet.
He refused my friend request.
They are not enemies, but friends.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
Mary won't listen to her friend's advice.
Why did you take a cab?
I was watching TV when the telephone rang.
You're a bad liar.
How long has she been sick?
His secretary seems to know the truth.
How long have you been a doctor here?
I'm joking.
What if he fails?
You don't need to take your shoes off.
We're all going home.
You're a very attractive woman.
I bought a new television.
I'll show you around the city.
I can't stand it any longer.
I want to stay with you.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
He is afraid of becoming sick.
I thought we had an understanding.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
I dozed on a park bench.
I didn't ask you to come with us.
The table was covered with paper.
It was a good answer.
We need a plan.
Tom shaved off his mustache.
I have no religion.
You should practice playing the violin every day.
How can you be so sure of that?
I remember now.
Who wants you to be the boss?
This car was so cheap that he could afford it.
That is so embarrassing.
Tom may come and visit me any time he wants to.
I don't like to be away too long.
Will it take long to recover?
It was very cool.
At last, you've hit the nail on the head!
It seems that the rainy season has set in.
She told him all about her childhood.
You're not staying here, are you?
It takes time.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
All I think about is you.
It's unlikely Tom will win.
I'm too old for you.
That's what scared me.
Why is she so popular?
When did you get back from Boston?
You should tell Tom what to do.
It stinks.
I had the door repaired.
Would you mind if I came along?
He's an advocate of barefoot running.
I still can't believe we won.
I am an artist.
We shouldn't have tried to help Tom.
Ten people were injured in the accident.
I was impressed with her work.
I forgot to telephone him today.
Wait! I'm coming!
He painted the door blue.
You should look out for potholes when driving.
Have you ever dreamed of me?
Was I supposed to just ignore it?
You don't seem too surprised.
I have a boiled egg for breakfast every day.
Is anyone looking?
I don't know where my socks are.
I don't want to be your friend.
Have you heard from her?
That's hardly the point, is it?
Are you looking for something?
How much does that cost?
I need you to see this.
I planted an apple tree in my yard.
How could you be so cruel?
I think I'd better do that now.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
I see you've made a friend.
Are you a golfer?
She's materialistic and shallow.
What were you waiting for?
Nothing like that will happen again.
Tom looked a little frightened.
Where's my bag?
Smoking harms your health.
The doctor reassured me about my father's condition.
It felt pretty good.
Are you registered?
Anyone home?
What's the worst tattoo you've ever seen?
Please move this stone from here to there.
I was very patient.
Clean your room.
We've got to get you out of here.
I painted the roof light blue.
I hate that book.
You should try it on.
You're not very good.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
Tom had some very unusual experiences.
Am I stupid?
She sat next to me.
The weather is bad today.
I assume that was Tom's idea.
Tom poured milk into a bowl for his cat.
Let's sit down.
Please come into the room.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
Have you gone mad?
Tom worked as a waiter.
Has Tom always been fat?
Tom didn't go to Boston.
Where's the source of this river?
I think it won't rain tomorrow.
Please be sure to take one dose three times a day.
How could you know?
Why's everyone whispering?
Are you looking for your parents?
Let's talk shop for a while.
I feel the same way, too.
Tom barricaded himself in his room.
Did anyone else help you?
I cannot lend this book to you.
I could use some advice.
I don't really want to be all by myself.
I'm kidding.
That was no ordinary storm.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
You can't kick Tom out of the club.
You're out of control.
He says he's innocent, but they put him in jail.
A beautiful sunset, isn't it?
We moved into this house last month, but we still haven't settled down.
Have a great weekend.
Like it or not, you must do it.
Are you here with anyone?
This is not for you.
Your dream may come true at any moment.
This tree is older than I am.
The water was cold.
Do you really want to dance?
Isn't that just a brush fire?
Let's see what you can do.
All the names are listed in alphabetical order.
We could really use another person around here.
What a fiasco!
He talks as if he were rich.
You're the one who trained me.
I've caught a bad cold.
Is there somebody else here?
The police are looking into it.
We can't take the risk.
She has some beautiful antique furniture.
Is the bank open?
He led his men and horses over snowy mountains and down into hot valleys.
I just want to let you know that I can't attend this afternoon's meeting.
I'm mistaken.
They all understood your speech.
Our lives are determined by our environment.
Man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs to.
I don't have time to read.
A screw's missing.
This is for everybody.
If only you'd thought of that before shooting your big mouth off.
Are you talking shop?
Tom must've misunderstood Mary.
My arm is hurting badly.
I can attest to everything she just said.
I saw this movie a very long time ago.
Tom's room was very clean.
It'll take some time to get used to wearing a wig.
Who do you have to do that with?
This one's a little harder.
I was up all night studying.
Are you over your cold yet?
That isn't Tom's car.
You take my breath away.
He likes soccer a lot.
I gave you what you wanted.
Can I have a second?
I hope the rain stops soon.
Do you know his name?
What did you think of him?
He had an operation on his left leg.
Tom closed the door of his bedroom.
How will we pay our debts?
It was surprising that she said that.
Let's get married.
I don't suppose you ever really get over the death of a child.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
Tom is from Australia.
This river is beautiful.
Would you like to switch seats?
Don't talk about yourself like that.
It wasn't me who did that.
She advised him to drink more milk.
Please stop talking. I need to concentrate on my game.
No one doubts her fitness for the post.
You are really very productive today.
I thought you'd want this one.
It's great for families.
Tom is dangerous.
The policemen fired at the car's tires.
Don't trust people who praise you in your presence.
I'd do it again.
He is afraid that he will die.
How was your summer?
I think that's a mistake.
Choose books carefully.
He got the first prize.
She was amazed to hear the news.
Very few fat men have long noses.
I want to buy you a drink.
He can't have told a lie.
I married off my daughter.
He is slowly recovering from his illness.
Tom is washing his car.
Tom may have been in Boston with Mary last week.
I'd like to stand.
I can't do what Tom does.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
I was just trying to help.
We all have our secrets.
You're the only one I trust.
My father is too busy to take a walk.
She slapped him.
It's like one of those.
Tom asked Mary to lend him some money.
No one could tell where she was.
What are we having for supper?
Let me see it.
You'd better back off.
We're unrelated.
I bet you'd make a great father.
Tom bought a gun.
No one really cares.
How do they seem to you?
This is my project.
You leave me no choice.
It's very valuable.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I stayed home for a week.
I don't know this game.
I've never had a traffic accident.
He needs to answer the question.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
She sang better than him.
I need it ASAP.
I don't want to eat lunch now.
Beijing is bigger than Rome.
He stretched out his arm to take the book.
I feel trapped.
Is she your only daughter?
Excuse my clumsiness.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
My uncle drives a Ford.
It is very short.
Why can't you be more like your brother?
My mother has a driver's license, but she doesn't drive.
I don't know exactly.
Tom is not my friend anymore.
Tom turned his headlights off.
Let me take a gander.
Is this Tom's bike?
I love both cats and dogs.
It was awesome.
I can recommend this restaurant.
You don't want to know.
I feel lucky.
I can't buy that now, because I don't have enough money.
That's what's worrying me.
Does Tom want to rest?
He let me go.
I've been searching for my puppy for weeks.
Don't ask me such a hard question.
Have you ever been a witness in a court case?
The boy bowed to me.
When does the game begin?
I think Tom is nervous.
I remember being on a ship when I was only five years old.
He denies having done it.
We train together.
Is that the same guy?
I think Tom is illiterate.
I didn't know you were awake.
My phone has a caller ID that lets me screen my calls.
This carpet is beautiful.
I've only had my driver's license for three months.
It's in my jacket pocket.
I asked him to drive me home.
How may I help you?
Charity begins at home.
Tom eats twice as much as Mary.
I'm very glad to see you again.
You'll get over it.
You have to protect your family.
Maybe Tom is stupid.
Tom could probably tell us why.
That guy is a bandit.
I don't know what more I can say.
Are you old enough to drive?
Stay away from my daughter!
Yesterday he came back late.
He is as smart as any other boy in the class.
They refused.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
He hardly works.
Could you come and see me tomorrow?
He comes from Geneva.
What's standing between us and that happening?
I did it.
Is it always a sin to tell a lie?
We shook hands.
This chair needs to be fixed.
We know it works.
Is the house ready?
My sister is famous.
I was able to knit.
What were you two doing there anyway?
Tom is quite straightforward.
What's this room?
Do you think so?
I don't really have a cold.
That's another matter.
The old man narrowly escaped being run over by a car.
I'm waiting for your assistance.
Come back in an hour.
All four of the boys didn't have alibis.
You'll need this.
I prepared two translations of the text.
Do you want to be a bartender all your life?
I didn't touch anything.
Let the boy go.
I look forward to seeing you at Christmas.
I could never be like that.
The investigation is continuing.
She fell from the tree.
She shaved her head.
I don't need a suitcase that big.
Two times seven is fourteen.
I don't meet too many women.
If you do that, everyone's going to hate you.
Are you a maniac?
She promised not to tell anyone.
They never returned to their country.
He made the most of his opportunity.
Follow us.
I hate talking about politics.
Tom said he didn't know Mary's address.
Is your father rich?
The pain was almost unbearable.
I will give it to you.
Beware of pickpockets.
You're on the right track.
He had a traffic accident on his way to school.
Do you drink alcohol?
His memory amazes me.
Write the address clearly.
I met a lot of nice people.
May I have a bus route map?
Will you please check these figures?
Tom is smoking on the balcony.
This beef is good.
How did you discover that?
Some things can't be forgotten.
Stop acting like such a fool.
I love chocolate.
Possibly the factory will be closed down next week.
I have to talk to you alone.
Let's let the workers go home early today.
It's an abuse of power.
I love sitting on the beach.
I gave you fair warning.
This desk is better than that one.
The movie hasn't started yet.
Tom is the youngest.
That bicycle is too small for you.
Some of the roses in my garden are white, and the others are red.
Everyone wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.
Is it an emergency?
I'm always happy.
Don't let his snide remarks get the best of you.
What do you suppose is in this box?
She was quite nervous about her first flight.
Compasses point north.
Tom has to lose weight.
Have something to drink.
I don't like the atmosphere of that school.
Tom has lied to me again.
I can't figure out anything.
I'm just going across to the flower shop.
Steel traps are illegal.
This really is great weather.
I grew up in a poor family.
Tom began to laugh hysterically.
It's not about the money, is it?
There's no need for her to go there herself.
Tom closed his eyes again.
I haven't finished my lunch.
We considered it.
Apart from on rainy days, I always ride my bike to work.
You're very attractive.
Do you know this place well?
We're not staying.
Why don't we go together?
Try not to make any noise.
His child's life is in danger.
Can you spare me a few minutes? I'd like to have a word with you.
Since my mother was sick, I looked after her.
Are you here to arrest me?
Sometimes I hear things.
I think we need to postpone the meeting.
You're forgetful.
Everybody was stunned.
He squinted.
I didn't think you'd tell me.
She didn't let him touch her baby.
They shouldn't have written that.
She invited him in for a cup of coffee.
How old are your children now?
I've done that myself.
Why don't you take a look at this data?
I didn't laugh.
I want to name the baby after you.
I really like garlic.
Have any letters arrived for me?
How do we have to proceed in this case?
Tom is more intelligent than Mary.
I'm planning to stay at my uncle's place.
Doing that won't be easy.
Is that a trick question?
I've done some stupid things in my life.
Tom's gone.
How come she hung up on you?
I'm not a drug addict.
They may leave tomorrow.
There's nothing fun about that.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
Did you listen to music last night?
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.
I don't like this tie. Show me another one.
It is two miles from here to the park.
I cannot understand what you say.
My brother is still sleeping.
Sorry, I didn't notice that.
I expect your help.
Where is it?
You've been infected.
I go to work.
Your examination results are excellent.
The firm went under due to lack of capital.
He saw that he was wrong.
I've never seen such a beautiful flower.
She cooked the dinner herself.
It's really very good.
Maybe we can find someplace to park further up the street.
The murderer took the weapon with him.
Will you show me the picture?
They wanted to win the war quickly and return to normal life.
He helped me do my homework.
I'm sure they'll be very happy together.
I'll meet you outside.
I wish I had known how to do it.
Where's the shovel?
She is really in good health.
Most whales feed on plankton.
Did you get all that?
I can't live without him.
I'm celebrating.
You're considerate.
Now let's see what happens.
I like to draw pictures.
He postponed leaving for Hokkaido until next month.
Spend your time wisely and you'll always have enough of it.
I'll find you.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
The accident happened two hours ago.
All you need to do is trust each other.
He sat down beside her.
Do you have any Japanese newspapers?
Tom is always lying.
You are trusted by every one of us.
That's not how I remember it.
I don't wanna hear a word from you.
He likes anything sweet.
His hobby is collecting strange butterflies.
Have you heard the good news?
What was the name of the hotel where you stayed in Boston last year?
Are there any cute boys in your class?
Tom knows what you did.
I just met the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You've turned up at the right moment.
A bicycle will rust if you leave it in the rain.
Can you see the picture?
I can speak Chinese, but I can't read it.
They shared the money.
Who gave you these flowers?
According to the Bible, God created the world in six days.
Tom really likes his new job
She had a vague feeling of guilt.
It's safe here.
I'm a detective.
The flame flickered for a moment, then died out.
You're my type.
Be careful, Tom.
I like your new hairstyle.
I went hiking.
She waved both her hands so that he could find her.
I don't really have a gun.
I had to climb over the wall.
I'm alone.
I was ashamed of my behavior.
I'm not surprised you don't know the answer.
I'll meet you there in an hour.
He is likely to win the game.
We've got to get rid of all this trash.
I had to drop out of college and get a job.
I received a letter written in English yesterday.
Your hypothesis is completely unrealistic.
Bears can climb trees.
Speak louder, please.
Can you sell the book to me for 500 yen?
Do you have an extra key?
About how much money do you need?
Everyone's gone home.
He was paroled after having served eleven years of his sentence.
I'm sick of hearing it.
Tom dove into the swimming pool.
You're very upset.
Tell me about your children.
He wants to get a new dictionary.
You aren't going to cry, are you?
You don't seem too worried.
I'm not angry.
They're thirty dollars each.
It's my job.
He has a beautiful tan.
That's one reason why I'll never do it again.
She accompanied him to Japan.
I'm not cleaning that up.
What's in the file?
The ice sheets are melting.
She burned herself while lighting a cigarette.
I'll take care of this dog.
I think that's everything.
I like short hair.
It's never too late to learn.
I was told to leave this alone.
It all depends how you handle it.
She came to see me.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
I know that it is highly unlikely that you'd ever want to go out with me, but I still need to ask at least once.
I'll have to make amends to them for my mistake.
The argument is rigorous and coherent but ultimately unconvincing.
That's a completely unfounded rumor.
She beat him to death with a golf club.
You're absolutely right.
I didn't see a doctor last year.
I know Tom was horrified.
Nobody died.
A century is one hundred years.
Take mine.
I have some cash stashed away.
Our lives changed.
I don't mind that at all.
He's in for a shock.
We need to be prepared.
We moved into a new house.
He is sick.
This is a good textbook.
Please tell me what you saw then.
Tom adopted Mary's three children.
Please book me a room in a first-class hotel.
The meeting was almost over.
She helped him.
I'm Canadian.
I gave Tom a huge hug.
Tom said he'd be willing to try anything once.
Tom caught a whole string of fish.
What I can do for you?
There's something under the bed.
My dream is to make it as an actor in Hollywood.
Tom is a spy.
Nobody's going to rescue you.
She gave him all the money that she had.
Where did you find my umbrella?
Those are your choices.
He felt it was his duty to go.
Look it up.
You can say whatever you want.
Nobody asked me anything.
Tom said that he was going to be late.
If I tell my mother, she'll worry, so I don't think I'll tell her.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
I couldn't find it.
I was eating lunch when the phone rang.
How do you explain all this?
I won't fight you.
I've been debating whether I should mention it or not.
I really like that guy.
He'll never forgive me.
You can't just leave us here with no food and water.
My phone rang again.
We thought it wise not to continue our trip.
What have you done to him?
I want a match. Do you have one?
Tom punched Mary.
You should not despise a man just because he is poorly paid.
I go to bed very early.
Fill the bucket with water.
So what's your problem?
Go home.
I was slightly surprised.
Tom started screaming and yelling.
The room was packed.
I must speak with you alone.
Her genius makes up for her lack of experience.
Medication and alcohol often don't mix.
I promise you I'll look after you.
You're the reason I came.
Tom goes swimming every day.
Does this mean you're not coming to help?
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
I can't be seen with you.
It's good that the horse didn't suffer.
She bought a new car.
This store sells vegetables.
I was eighteen then.
Is your new computer working well?
I appreciate your support.
Awesome!
You don't need to go there.
We need another person to play cards.
Tom's father is in jail.
I have a reservation for six-thirty.
Does anyone want some more pie?
We're not done.
Why do you want me to wait in here?
She earns more than she spends.
We have an advantage.
We need your help.
Tom wore goggles.
I have no desire to hurt you.
She's my classmate.
I kept my mouth shut.
We must work hard to break down social barriers.
Should I repeat that?
She showed me which dress to wear.
Do it when you have time.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Hang the mirror on the wall.
The teacher is busy looking over the examination papers.
We made it.
Tell me what your problem is.
I was meaning to ask you about that.
He is tired from overwork.
The bag is full.
Tom is a very good sculptor.
Go and see who it is.
Do you go to the pool often?
Please note that the price is subject to change.
I don't need advisers.
I had a crush on you when we were in high school.
They always talk about the same things.
There are only three options.
Did you do your homework?
He let us go.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
The noise was deafening.
Please say the alphabet backwards.
Don't give up the fight.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Your fly is open!
Tom and I'll meet again next week.
You had better ask him which way to take.
You will succeed some day.
Will he come to the meeting next week?
May I have your name and telephone number, please?
Why did you ask Tom to do that when you knew he couldn't do it?
Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
I love it when that happens.
Tom is downstairs.
Are you coming or not?
It's not safe here.
You may go if you choose.
She tried to persuade him to go with her.
That ball could've hit me.
You sound like you don't want to be an archaeologist.
She's a jealous woman.
I am going to write a letter.
You've never seen a genuine diamond.
I never thought he was capable of doing something so cruel.
There's a chance that tap water may contain harmful substances like chlorine and lead.
How did you get these?
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?

They lived in Spain for several years.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
We're speechless.
That could be a coincidence.
He stood there with his eyes closed.
Today is Tom's birthday.
Everything looked nice.
It took me two hours to reach Yokohama.
Don't make me suffer.
Don't tell me to shut up.
I knew what you meant.
Look into the matter more carefully.
He requested that I come here again this afternoon.
They are both good.
Tom was stabbed to death by someone on the subway.
He was born rich.
Tom is in critical condition.
How could you know?
Who is in the car? "Tom is."
I would really like to know why he did such a thing.
He was the kind of kid who was always showing off to his classmates.
He got across the river.
How many times a week do you spend time doing fun stuff with your children?
I couldn't accept the job.
I knew Tom was from Boston.
I understand your concern.
The ice in the water melted.
Tom wants to try it.
Where's the toilet?
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
I had to change the rules.
She got the money from him even though he said that he wouldn't give it to her.
I won't be here that long.
He himself did it.
How much money has been spent on building the museum?
You must be sleepy.
I can't believe you eat that stuff.
I should be in charge.
We'll find somewhere else to go.
Call Tom.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
Don't even think of asking me what I think about you right now.
No one disagreed.
He had no house to live in.
I bought it for about twelve dollars.
She is poor, but she looks happy.
Time flies.
I think Tom's idea is a good one.
Will you please shut the door?
What do you do?
Let's paint the town red.
We're still involved.
We're downsizing.
The exchange rates are posted daily outside the cashier's office.
We exchanged phone numbers at the end of the gathering.
If you act like a child, you will be treated as such.
I can read your mind.
I won't put up with this any longer.
You should stay with me.
That's how it started.
It's easy for her to make friends.
All the students attended the party.
I like walking around barefoot.
I can't swim, but my younger brother can.
Tom's famous.
We agreed among ourselves.
Who wants hot chocolate?
I had to be sure.
Stocks hit a new high.
Your idea is similar to mine.
Can I count on you?
It is very kind of you to send me such a nice present.
Tom could've followed us.
You shouldn't take the things Tom says seriously.
I'm not too convinced.
I'll leave the decision to you.
Why don't you start by telling us where you went?
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
I wanted him to go there.
If you can't come, you should let me know ahead of time.
I felt my heart beating rapidly.
Tom says he needs to talk with you.
I can see you're in a good mood.
Tom handed me the letter and left.
He never travels without taking an alarm clock with him.
My brother has no money.
You should do that now.
I'm housesitting.
Can he see us?
I slapped his face.
We agreed we'd give it a shot.
I dropped out of college.
Where did you go for spring break?
Tom showed Mary John's photo.
He was worn out when he got home.
The treaty was signed.
It's not that difficult.
Don't they drive you mad?
He is in need of money.
Learning a foreign language is difficult.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
I'm glad you were able to meet Tom.
The book is mine.
He had heard wonderful stories about cities of gold with silver trees.
Most people consider murder wrong.
Have you figured out the cost?
We're not involved.
She told us an interesting story.
Tom stayed in Boston for three days.
We went on a picnic together.
You don't really expect me to tell you, do you?
That's why I lied.
My sister is my daughter's godmother.
Why did Tom want it?
Stay calm and do your best.
The job of a driver is harder than it looks.
The train left before I arrived at the station.
The army has advanced to the river.
He is respected by everybody.
Without you, life is awful.
It breaks my heart to see you crying.
You have to let me help.
This milk tastes odd.
Are you wondering what we ended up doing?
If you want one, you'll have to find your own.
You knew how to count to ten when you were two years old.
He's got a headache.
I can't let them catch you.
Cash is better.
Where do we go now?
I'm by your side.
What're you getting all excited about?
They went out after they finished lunch.
It's really not as hard to do as you think it is.
I don't care what you do with it.
This will do for a chair.
We didn't see any children at all.
Why are you so scared to talk to him?
I think I could handle that.
The truck made a sharp turn to the right.
I read the article about you in yesterday's newspaper.
I didn't quite catch the name of that designer.
I believe that we found the problem.
Why is it my fault?
You must do this alone.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
You can't keep this a secret.
I apologize for the late reply.
This is your pilot speaking.
Do you play tennis well?
I apologized profusely.
Let's go somewhere tonight, OK?
Some kinds of birds can't fly.
Tom put all his belongings in a small suitcase.
That's unrealistic.
They'll try again.
Would you mind rubbing my feet?
I give you plenty of money each month.
God created the heaven and the earth.
More than twenty boys went there.
I'll leave that up to you.
Wake me up at seven.
It was his fault.
It's not an either-or situation.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I? "No, of course not."
I looked at my watch and noted that it was past five.
I hope that Tom didn't do that.
My leg is still hurting.
I want you to explain it to me in more detail.
At last, they experienced the joy of victory.
I didn't meet anyone.
I never wanted to hurt you.
It scared the daylights out of him.
Do you mind if I smoke here?
I wonder why the dogs are barking.
Turn the hose off.
I know that won't happen again.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
Aren't you surprised to see me?
I really don't want to talk about it.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
I didn't recognize your voice.
Tom says that he hates to study.
He asked me out on a date.
I don't think you're schizophrenic.
They grew closer.
I'd rather ride my bike than walk.
A boat capsized.
I don't have a box.
I've learned a lot about modern authors.
In the summer, it is very hot here.
He said he would see me the next day.
I started a fire right away.
It is time to go to bed.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
The window was open.
You are free to leave any time you wish.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
I'll be brief.
Do you mind if I go back to sleep now?
You're making a huge mistake.
She went to the museum by taxi.
He's got a rap sheet as long as my arm.
I'll take it into consideration.
I caught them in the act.
Tell us what you want to do.
He discovered how to open the box.
You shouldn't drink this water.
I told you it was going to be easy.
That broken vase is my grandfather's.
That pleases me very much.
Which way are you going?
You are no longer welcome here.
Tom is a student.
I told you this was going to be boring.
You're wonderful.
Be watchful.
Which is correct?
Which car is yours?
When you've finished reading that book, I'd like to read it.
Whatever you do, don't open that door.
My money seems to disappear by the end of the month.
Coffee will be served after the meal.
He and I are teachers.
Overtaxed heart, kidneys and liver are inevitable results of too much food.
The early bird gets the worm.
I'm cool.
They don't like you.
I promise you I won't ever leave you.
I just want to talk to them.
Which cup will he choose?
Don't use too much water.
That is a very interesting story.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
I like your country a lot.
Those are your choices.
I intend to do so.
Show me what's in your pocket.
Are you for real?
This novel is boring.
That meant no.
I fell into the water.
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
Let's see what you have there.
When do you play tennis?
This is the house which was designed by a famous architect.
It is necessary for you to stop smoking.
Today, everything went awry from the start.
We make a really good team.
My college has a dorm.
Thank you for the advice.
You can do it, too.
None of these things look tempting.
You were drunk, weren't you?
It is Pochi's food.
He managed to escape through a window.
Forgive me for being late.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
Probably you are allergic to pollen or dust.
I want this room sealed.
I don't know where to go or what to do.
I want to bring my family here.
You may use my dictionary.
I think you did it.
He surprised his opponent.
I thought it was a joke.
Did you want anything else?
I'm living my dream.
He must finish his homework today.
He reads a great deal.
Have you asked if they want one?
I need some sugar. Do you have any?
She was advised by him to be punctual.
It looks like I came at a bad time.
I think you know what has to be done.
I think I'll turn in now.
I think about you all the time.
Who fell?
I started it.
We needed help.
Tom is about my size.
Who's coming for dinner?
I know I've said some pretty stupid things today.
We're getting old.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
Tom will never change.
It might not be enough.
Can I sleep on your couch?
My father quickly scanned the newspaper.
I just wanted to have a little fun.
I like having breakfast with you.
You are good.
He has a car that has four doors.
Can I use my medical insurance?
You're young and strong.
You could've killed somebody.
Where did you get your hair cut?
What were you doing in the attic?
He didn't keep his word.
We had a lot of rain last month.
He is a gentleman.
I have to change.
You shouldn't let your girlfriend borrow your iPhone.
Do you want to hear my theory?
Are you sure you're not tired?
Let's drink some beer.
Would you follow me?
Did you look under the car?
Can you pitch?
Comedy is something that makes you laugh.
She says she is seeing things.
A museum is a great place to find a date.
What did they hit you with?
I thought Tom had a meeting this afternoon.
You're sleepy.
He is able to speak five languages.
I don't know anything.
What we want is freedom.
What are you doing next summer?
We're both right.
I'm just tired.
They look happy.
I heard screaming in the next room.
I'm proud to be working on this project.
She asked him where he lived.
I know you want to make me happy.
I entered Tom's office after knocking on the door.
They were put in prison.
I know your roommate.
When did you become a teacher?
I figured you must be hungry by now.
Are you busy Friday night?
I got scammed.
I decided to tell him that I love her.
My car is older than me.
What do you do?
He fell asleep right away.
Do you need a ride?
I wish you had told me that.
I designed it.
What's going on?
She is among those unaccounted for.
The plane should have arrived at Kansai Airport by now.
Tom doesn't know who Mary has decided to give her old guitar to.
The ceremony will take place tomorrow.
I use it.
I had doubts.
We are going to have a meeting here tomorrow.
Why don't we start at the beginning?
You'd better tell the truth.
Tom promised that he wouldn't do that.
I have nothing to say with regard to that problem.
Did you encounter any problems?
I know that Tom is a wimp.
I wonder what's going to happen to us.
It's all I want.
I expect that he will help us.
I knew I should've stayed in Boston.
I know what that is.
When are you busy?
I know how busy you are.
I hadn't thought about that.
That looks expensive.
I can show you a better time.
He has been on a diet for two months.
I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
I left the door open.
Her belief in God is very firm.
Are you all right?
This bed is cold.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Tom is an experienced driver.
A great future lies before her.
What do you want to talk about?
Your theory has no scientific basis.
I've never been abroad.
What are the children doing in the garden?
Could I borrow your eyeliner?
I'm having a hard time concentrating.
It's surprising that you haven't heard anything about her wedding.
Be very careful.
Is this love?
Try not to look so nervous.
Tell Tom what's going on here.
How many times do you think you've eaten here?
You'd better not go today.
People were evacuated because of the flood.
That was really bad.
May I ask you something?
I slept very well last night.
What time does the exam start?
Are you sure there's nothing else to drink?
There are books here.
The brake didn't work.
Is anyone else home?
Not all of the staff was present.
I'm not arguing.
You're taller than me.
The only thing that matters is that you are safe.
I asked Tom how much he thought it would cost to get someone to paint our house.
We find the defendant not guilty.
I found it difficult to please her.
A team is only as strong as its weakest member.
That's not what I've heard.
I wanted to make new friends.
Where's the exit?
That tastes terrible.
I want to look different.
I have a lot of money at my disposal.
You're disturbing the whole neighborhood.
Tom swears a lot.
This bag cost me 6 pounds.
Promise me you won't do that again.
Do you know what it's called?
Let me introduce my parents to you.
She fixed us a snack.
We're surprised.
Are cats smarter than dogs?
Let's get this over with.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
Would you like to switch seats?
The bullet went through his body.
The employee was escorted off the premises.
You should not judge a person by his clothes.
The president appeared powerless.
How do you say that?
Didn't you write a letter to him?
I think Tom was looking for you.
You're fashionable.
You never told me that.
I know it was an accident.
Never rely too much upon others.
I don't take vacations very often.
I have no control over it.
After the summer holidays, the children have to go back to school.
You're the laziest person I know.
I'd like to be a teacher.
How many times have I told you?
Could you buy everything you needed?
You've got to be making this up.
Can you still remember where we first met?
Is there anything that I can do for you?
We pay the kid next door to mow our lawn.
This is what you're supposed to do.
We sat in lawn chairs and stared at the mountain.
Was there a scandal?
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen.
Don't you feel the house shaking?
You may take either the big box or the small one.
I hope we can fix that.
Please open the door.
She likes to listen to music.
Have another cup of coffee.
I find that offensive.
Who cheated?
They shouldn't be doing that.
Tom advised Mary to go to the police.
Have you ever been lonely?
I am buying candy and cookies.
I waited up.
Are those for me?
I admit that at first I didn't like you.
Where does he work?
The train came to a smooth stop.
Show me how to do that.
I'm not your daughter.
We were thoroughly satisfied with his work.
Tom wanted to know what had happened.
I want a boat that'll take me far away from here.
How do you know where to go?
Have you read the article about Asia in Time?
I needed the money.
Read whatever you like.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Don't jump to any conclusions.
Tom's broken arm took several weeks to heal.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
I believe that he is innocent.
On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers.
Do you have your laptop with you?
She promised to marry him.
If you find a mistake, please leave a comment.
No one warned me.
Tell me how I can help you.
I would like to talk with you again.
I'm no rebel.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not thinking clearly.
Stop doing that, please.
Tom will be here any minute now.
She worries about my health.
So what are you suggesting?
You should be more careful the next time.
I don't have as much money as you think I do.
I don't know what to call you.
I'd like a table by the window.
I figured you wouldn't want to go there without me.
He rubbed his hands together.
My information was accurate.
I know how this works.
Tom emigrated to Australia when he was thirty.
I feel like vomiting.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Please throw me the ball.
Everyone felt safe.
This is how I feel.
I don't really have a boyfriend.
She has not come here yet.
I really have to eat something.
She said goodbye.
It's not the end of the world.
Tom knows how to dive.
How can you not know?
What do you want for your birthday?
Someone is calling you.
You don't sound very confident.
I think I'm losing my mind.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
I couldn't make out what he wanted to say.
He could read me like an open book.
I hesitated about which road to take.
New York is worth visiting.
Japanese should not forget that America is a multiracial nation.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
Do you know what time they came?
Say it in English.
Whose dog is this?
There are a lot of fish in the sea.
He's got an uncle who works in a bank.
Why not join us for lunch?
That's a good reason.
Tom put thirty dollars on the table.
How did you manage to win?
Tom has a mustache.
She picked up one of the glass vases.
The red flag indicated the presence of danger.
There is no significant difference.
He asked the lady standing next to him some questions.
I tested everything.
I'm pretty sure Tom wasn't there.
We didn't see anybody.
I will wait till you have written the letter.
I'm glad we're all in agreement.
Tom has never danced with Mary.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
Didn't you have the flu last week?
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
I'd rather not do it.
He attempted to climb the fence to no avail.
Why are we being punished?
Stop taking pictures. You look like a tourist.
I didn't see him.
That company's stock price fell yesterday.
Have some pity on me.
I don't really care.
She called me up very late last night.
I have to keep my mind on this important question.
Tom is upstairs.
What would you like to do tomorrow?
She is used to living alone.
They let me go.
I thought I had a good chance.
You've made that clear.
We are looking forward to seeing you and your family.
Who else are we talking about?
I thought you were at work.
It is important to understand that each country has its own culture.
Maybe we shouldn't do that today.
She always dresses in black.
That doesn't happen a lot.
The telephone is ringing, but nobody is answering.
Tom is losing his hair.
The plane arrived on time.
You don't have to go unless you want to.
Tom is a fairly good skier.
They told me to stay in the car.
Nobody told me Tom would be here.
The motor does not function properly.
This is curious.
Tom opened the book and started reading.
You're worried, aren't you?
My friend is bilingual.
The whale shark is the largest shark in the world.
He was sentenced to death by firing squad.
He is no good as a lawyer.
The damage is done.
You're opportunistic.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
What does this sentence mean?
As time passed, the radioactivity diminished.
I'm the one who ought to apologize.
I do this almost every day.
I must make up for lost time by driving fast.
This can't be what I think it is.
She got no answer from him.
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.
This is all I can do.
Don't worry about that now.
Nothing seemed to work.
I really like being with you.
My house is small.
I knew nobody would believe me.
She covered the mouthpiece of the phone with her hand.
Some people are never content with what they have.
I'd be unhappy if that happened again.
Is it hard to speak English?
I was asleep.
I left part of the meal uneaten.
Mankind will succeed in using nuclear energy peacefully.
Who'll go?
He got very drunk.
I knew you'd come back sooner or later.
Is it only about money?
You don't get up as early as your sister, do you?
When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person.
We watched a new program on television.
We talk about it every day.
The school gate is closed.
I want to get my ears pierced.
She sings well.
I still don't know.
I still don't like it.
We were shown all of their family photos.
I don't know if he knows it.
I care about all of you.
The last time I went to the beach, I got badly sunburned.
Tom already has our respect.
He didn't stop talking.
Why are you so busy today?
I'd like you to meet my husband.
She spoke to him about the matter.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
You can do it, too.
The results are inconclusive.
I want to show you something I've been working on.
I was just going to scare Tom.
I'll buy a new one.
Whose bike is this?
We're going to have to work together.
She is always complaining of her small salary.
What did you hide?
Let's hit the showers.
I have an old car.
Don't touch the wet paint.
I'm stunned.
I have to leave now.
There is little hope that they are alive.
That's a heartwarming scene.
I am going to be an engineer.
It'll be hard to convince Tom to help us.
I don't dance.
I was pleasantly surprised.
I am in deep water.
Tom thinks Mary lied.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
Strive to be happy.
Patience is a rare virtue these days.
Do you have your driver's license?
I want to know the truth about my son's death.
I was going to go.
I did that by myself.
I don't want your legal advice.
My husband always reads in bed.
We're all a bit a scared.
You're stuck.
In legal documents, difficult words and phrases are often used.
Something had to be done.
Thanks to his help, I finished my homework.
What are they whispering to each other?
Can they give you something for that?
Tom is trying to provoke me.
Six months ago I had an operation for the cataract in my right eye.
That is how the accident occurred.
Tom works for a translation agency.
It's inadequate.
It looks like Tom was able to get what he wanted.
They're both in love with the same girl.
I'll miss you when you're gone.
Tom injured his left hand in an accident.
Be a good boy.
I said it was all right.
You did a good thing.
How much did they give you for your old car?
I have the ace of hearts.
Did you enjoy the movie?
Are you productive?
They had no money left.
Our former home was in Sweden.
Do you go to school by bus?
Where are the suitcases?
My grandfather loves to read.
I didn't do what I was told to do.
We are having a good time.
I made plans.
Is this made in Switzerland?
The fire is spreading.
She said nothing that would make him angry.
He was a general in the Second World War.
I haven't got all day, you know.
Some of them were wounded.
I think she'll succeed.
We've been invited to the opening ceremony.
Tom closed the door of his bedroom.
A dog is a man's best friend.
I am given a monthly allowance of fifty thousand yen.
I have been to the U.S. twice.
You have to believe in yourself.
Would you like to eat something?
How do you plan to handle this?
It's happening all the time now.
We made a bargain.
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
You have to stay fit.
Keep this to yourself.
I'm not so good at tennis.
Tell me more about yourself.
There she comes.
You seem a million miles away.
My house is near the school.
You can stay only if you're quiet.
That decision hasn't yet been made.
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
What's he hiding?
Tom shut the kitchen door.
I'd like to ask you one question.
You've gone too far this time.
He didn't say a word.
Go ahead.
I wasn't ready for what was about to happen.
AI means Artificial Intelligence.
Hey, Tom, can I ask you something?
It's inadequate.
I love bread.
Tom is one of the richest men in Boston.
Hold still.
Tom didn't appear.
I drove the car into the garage.
That was a pretty good move.
Keep on smiling.
He wears expensive clothes and owns a lot of jewelry.
She takes after her mother.
Everyone dies eventually.
Where would you want to live?
You never asked why.
Not everyone needs a college degree.
Which color do you prefer, blue or green?
Tom was fined for speeding.
I want a parrot.
Were you with anyone?
Replace the old tires with new ones.
Are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
What would you do in this situation?
Tom doesn't smoke.
The fire started in Tom's room.
So, are you going to tell me who you are?
Tom said that he had been cleaning the house all day.
I thought you were taller.
I told you to sign the document.
You may bring whoever wants to come.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
What time do you usually eat breakfast?
She runs a dance studio.
You don't understand what's happening.
Things got really weird.
I know where he lives.
He wasn't watching TV then.
They're really tight.
It looks like you just saw a ghost.
Can I call you again?
Did you foresee this?
You're not from around here, are you?
Tom isn't a professional.
He came back at nine o'clock.
Do you miss it?
Enjoy the show.
I'll call you back when I get to the bus stop.
Do not forget to turn the light off before you go to bed.
I'm really disappointed.
I don't know what to say.
The cancer has spread to her stomach.
Don't be such a fool.
Could you check the tire pressure?
My daughter studies in that school.
I had a good time during the trip.
They think the owner of the house is studying abroad.
Why don't you do that yourself?
This stone was too heavy for me to lift.
I remember all that.
With any luck, there will be no school tomorrow.
You should have woken me up.
They were very kind to me.
There was nothing you could have done.
I'd rather stay home with you.
The town has changed a great deal since then.
Do you want to come over and watch a movie?
May I sit next to you?
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
What happened was unexpected.
This is what'll happen.
He saw a light far away.
How can you be sure of that?
Come in. The door is open.
I want to tell you the story.
You dropped something.
We are not alone.
What'll they do to Tom?
I knew you'd be caught.
This is the stupidest thing I've ever done.
I'll study French next year.
Our cat's fur has lost its luster.
Where do babies come from?
I had to get some money.
Tom seems young.
I love the way you talk.
How could you be so cruel?
The lake is big.
I gave Tom everything he asked for.
Tom has no insurance.
I like to laugh.
I buried it.
She earns more than she spends.
Do you have a cellphone?
I am not proud of this.
Focus on your breathing.
I need new tires.
I can't believe you would do that to me.
Do you want me to do that?
May I ask you to close the window?
Tom likes cooking for Mary.
The room was crowded with furniture.
She didn't have a brother.
We're anxious.
I like being alone.
Please think it over.
Do you see a black horse?
Excuse me, but could you scoot over a little bit, please?
I'll give you all the money you want.
I'm the happiest man in the world.
That should be easy.
Tom went outside to smoke a cigarette.
I saw it on TV.
Do you know what UNESCO stands for?
I'm a stranger here.
Someone might get hurt.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
I didn't recognize him at first on the train.
Are you avoiding me?
If you spend too much time in the sun without putting on sunscreen, you are likely to get a sunburn.
This party is awesome.
When did they build that?
I attempted to swim across the river.
Everybody saw it.
I agree completely.
I must've forgotten.
I enjoy looking at my old diary.
I'm starved.
I have nothing in particular to say about this situation.
The matter was settled.
I've already made it.
Do you have a special menu for vegetarians?
My boss is keeping me pretty busy.
She gained weight.
We're all aware of it now.
Is that our problem?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
I had to do everything by myself.
The diamond was set in a gold ring.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
I thought you weren't coming.
We have to stop now.
She liked that.
I don't need a partner.
Don't enter the room until I say "All right."
Mass production reduced the price of many goods.
Everyone is unique.
You're very rude.
She stole my clothes!
I didn't like this game until I started winning.
How did you end up here?
Your ideas are all out of date.
I owe you so much.
We're going upstairs.
I've decided to accept the job offer.
The employee was escorted off the premises.
We've got to find Tom.
Tom isn't concerned about that.
They didn't obey their parents.
I want to see you in your office in half an hour.
I need a favor.
Sorry, I don't understand.
She choked him with her bare hands.
Nobody but you can make me happy.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
Tom raised his right hand.
It's a small price to pay.
He says he's got to get to Vienna the day after tomorrow.
Tom never spoke to Mary again.
I didn't say you were here.
That boy looks like you.
I think about it often.
You can't just barge in here whenever you feel like it.
As far as I know, she hasn't departed yet.
Nature is full of mystery.
We had to stop.
You are gorgeous.
Tom hurt his knee when he fell.
He was too proud to accept any reward.
This is not funny anymore.
I hope that you'll help me.
They know our plans.
I had quite a busy day today.
This rose is very beautiful.
Tom broke up with me.
He's not in.
I can't believe I didn't get invited.
I felt very happy.
It's necessary for you to go.
I thought I saw a rabbit on the road.
They live next door.
The door won't close.
It serves you right.
She advised him not to spend all his money on his girlfriend.
We're proud of that.
I didn't hear a splash.
The English language is undoubtedly the easiest and at the same time the most efficient means of international communication.
I find myself in a rather delicate situation.
He put the box on the table.
I still have to do that.
He is always finding fault with other people.
We got lucky.
He took advantage of the opportunity.
London is the capital of England.
My life has changed quite a lot.
Her sister looks young.
I thought you were kidding.
Let's not tell anybody that we're married.
Don't be ridiculous.
I think it's going to rain.
How do you know?
This is a book about stars.
I'm going to make you an offer that you can't refuse.
Tom wanted to become a farmer.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He asked the man to help him.
Perhaps he will come.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
That's not a secret.
For here, or to go?
I got a useful piece of information out of him.
Why do you want to study abroad?
Tom and Mary decided to leave.
He didn't want to antagonize her.
I'll pick you up at six.
I'm sorry I hurt Tom.
It's not too early.
I can teach you my language.
Can you describe it?
Why is Tom so afraid of Mary?
I'm slightly hungry.
I never forgot you.
I just feel a little inadequate.
I'm not the jealous type.
You're very sharp.
They finished their meal.
We can't leave Tom here. He won't survive on his own.
Tom wasn't scared of the police.
The general inspected the troops.
Shall we order?
Don't move.
You'd better go by bus.
You're wasting ammo.
You have the same camera as mine.
They'll have a blast.
Tom kissed Mary.
He'll come on foot or by bicycle.
He will look after the cats for me while I'm abroad.
She will have a baby next month.
They had a heated discussion.
Don't take it personally.
It rained heavily yesterday.
Tom never told me why he wasn't here the day before yesterday.
I'm not ready for this.
Smith died of a heart attack.
Tell me what the matter is.
I misunderstood.
I need a holiday.
How do you stand this cold?
This isn't the time to talk about that.
I want the truth from you.
Open your mouth!
Give me a towel.
That old man is a fussy eater.
You have a great imagination.
I'm all out of ideas.
Give me a piece of paper.
Do you hate Tom? "I don't hate him, but I do think he's a bit strange."
There's not much difference.
Tom pretended to be busy.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
Her viewpoint is limited.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
I passed the test with flying colors.
Hurry up, or you will be late.
I was not drunk.
I'm looking forward to Christmas.
My internet connection was cut off.
Tom isn't really my type.
She did not return till six.
Your dog is very big.
All of my children can speak French.
The ship had three decks.
I'll cancel.
That noise woke me up.
I know what I want to do.
He gave me a watch.
That's kind of vague.
You really have an ear for music.
I told him to work hard or he would fail.
I need more gold.
I really don't want to eat right now.
How did that happen?
I want you to read this book.
The same is true of all human beings.
Would you be fired if you did that?
Tom walked out of the meeting.
This is worse than everything else.
We had a pleasant evening.
I made that one.
Don't forget your bag.
The fire started in Tom's room.
I met an old woman.
Tom has a broken arm.
I hope you'll find this office satisfactory.
We'll someday make the world a better place.
I want the whole world to know that we're in love.
I think we can make it on time.
I don't know which of you is older.
Why do you keep giving him money?
Any child can do that.
Did I blow it?
I'll let you know when she arrives.
I shouldn't have walked home late at night by myself.
She has a tattoo of a lizard on her thigh.
He has a good appetite.
I'm at work.
This coffee is quite strong.
Tom was afraid to cross the road.
Have you found a solution?
You've always been that way.
A lot of my hair has fallen out.
This should become standard practice.
Lead the way.
My car broke down on the way.
It's a really good school.
You can't go outside.
I think we should get out here.
Tom woke up with heartburn.
Don't forget that she's a woman.
You're not as smart as me.
This glass isn't mine.
I thought we'd have fun together.
I am good at math.
He invested his money in stocks.
I can't promise anything.
She didn't pay back the money.
I've learned to cook.
I question your loyalty.
Can you see that small house?
You're dirty.
This coffee tastes bitter.
I don't know how they do it.
What's the secret ingredient?
They're right behind you.
You won't be shot.
I didn't see what was in the box.
Tom is in his bedroom doing his homework.
Show me an example.
I don't really care what you think.
Grammar is a very complex thing.
He asked me if I were happy.
Is it fatal?
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you also like jazz?
She traveled around Japan.
Tom probably thought I was at school.
Tom won't be in time for the meeting.
Give me a break.
The older we grow, the poorer our memory becomes.
It can be improved.
That was absolutely unnecessary.
You are responsible for what you have done.
The world's rainforests are currently disappearing.
I'm glad that you're here.
I'm about ready.
I couldn't fall asleep because of the noise.
These boxes are heavy.
I think you should go to college.
Tom said I didn't sound convinced.
My daughter had a concussion.
I am single.
I thought you were injured.
I visited Boston.
I was very hungry.
We want peace in the world.
I like to run.
You're all insane.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
Have you met the Jacksons?
Don't brake suddenly.
Tom wouldn't let Mary keep it.
Put your coat back on.
He rolled over in his sleep.
Over one hundred people came here.
Leave a comment.
I was very careful.
I had a revelation.
I felt my heart beating violently.
At last, they ceased working.
You should mind your own business.
Fortunately, the weather was good.
I'm not kidding.
He never talked about it.
Training for a marathon is taxing.
How do you pronounce your last name?
I'm in charge of this mission.
Tom took Mary in his arms and kissed her.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
Please come in.
Tom told Mary what had happened.
We are classmates.
Put the coat on the hanger.
Please call before you come.
I've been feeling bad for a week.
The troops were annihilated.
I think we should wait a little longer.
Tom happens to be very good at French.
They have nothing to eat.
It was all your imagination.
Can you play the violin?
Close the box.
I don't like the traffic.
Do you actually like this?
I apologize for not replying right away.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
I have just what you need.
This sentence doesn't make sense.
I wonder what it feels like to be rich.
I hit the snooze button and went back to sleep.
Why did he stop smoking?
Look under the seat.
I'm entitled to my own opinion.
Do come and visit us.
Go put some clean clothes on.
Tom remembered that Mary and John had tried to kill him.
It reminded me of you.
Do you speak French fluently?
Why did I not know this?
We cannot tell a good person from a bad one by looks alone.
Could I borrow your car?
It is no joke.
Tom's bag was badly damaged.
I know someone who can help you.
I cleared the table.
Take an umbrella with you in case it rains.
They're safe.
I'm not ready for this.
Have you seen the dog? He wandered off a couple of minutes ago.
Do you have a mobile phone?
You said you were busy.
That's when I injured my ankle.
How about I do that?
I don't want to break your heart.
It's not a virus.
I usually get up at 6:00.
Better him than me.
I really don't believe it.
I'm glad to hear of your success.
I felt it was necessary, so I did it.
Would you please slow down?
Everyone will be happy.
I never told anyone.
Stop screaming in my ears.
They have nothing against it.
Are you speaking metaphorically?
He has just as many books as his father does.
The Inca were a religious people.
Don't worry about me.
She wore a red blouse.
Is love just a game for you?
He hid behind the tree.
Can you give me Tom's address?
It's all over for us.
Tell them who you are.
I'm on our high school soccer team.
My mom made it for me.
We have a lot of regular customers.
I have fewer books than you.
My father must do the work.
This time is different.
It's finally my turn.
Can you pass me the salt?
I need the key to decode this message.
I'm only three years older than he is.
I think you did very well.
We're aware of that.
I finished writing a letter in English.
Have you ever had a serious illness?
Who was the first person to break the four-minute mile?
I have to get dressed now.
I'll show you exactly where I found this.
How many goats do they have?
Just because he likes painting doesn't mean he's good at it.
You had better not tell your father about the accident.
Do you mind if I smoke?
No one could solve the puzzle.
Some of you already know me.
Tom asked me to give you something.
It's obvious that he's not used to living on a tight budget.
Be sure to drop me a line.
What would you have me do?
I used to have one, but it was stolen.
Where did you go for spring break?
It appears to me that you put on my hat by mistake.
I think Tom drank out of my glass by mistake.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
If you want me to kiss you, all you have to do is ask.
What are they doing here?
I will do anything but that.
He gave her a foot massage.
This room is air-conditioned.
There is a museum just north of the zoo.
I didn't have to go.
Don't you want to be in love again?
I'm just kidding.
Nobody contributed to the understanding of dreams as much as Freud.
I'm volunteering.
Please come.
There was lavender in bloom as far as the eye could see.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
How much is the admission?
He couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
What is your address?
Do you know what she said?
I'll see if he is in.
Let's do our job.
We thank you for your cooperation.
We're starting to question what we thought we knew.
Tom stayed calm.
What are you majoring in?
How can anyone sleep with all this commotion going on?
Are you in good health?
I have the key.
She's no spring chicken.
It's getting dark. You'd better go home.
Someone is playing the piano.
I went over the report.
He died and his soul went to hell.
He took off his overcoat.
I plan on being early.
I have no religion.
I haven't gotten over my bad cold yet.
Do you have a solution?
I want to make you happy.
You don't have to sing.
You'll find a solution, I'm sure.
I missed my flight.
Have you read anything interesting lately?
Have you already had breakfast?
She is concerned about her son's health.
I've won.
Tom has never stolen money his whole life.
I can't remember what Tom looks like.
You're the only one who understands me.
We're in control.
For example, do you like English?
Who are we competing against?
He teaches English.
Wait. I want to tell you something.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him to.
I've never played the tuba.
I don't remember anything happening.
I wouldn't have worried about that.
She quit her job last month.
Tom can walk.
I just wanted to do my job.
At least they listened to me.
They deal in software products.
I'm no different.
She borrowed the book from him.
His clothes are out of fashion.
He built a new house.
I'm buying.
I think you'll be able to do it.
Are you behind all of this?
We looked at each other.
Use it or lose it.
He's bulked up quite a bit since he's been going to the gym.
Walk tall, son.
Tom eats nothing but his mother's cooking.
I heard a woman scream.
Even though she is 38, she still depends on her parents.
Get me something to eat.
He uses the same dictionary as I do.
I don't even have time to read.
He barely speaks English.
That is a mistake.
The boys were as nervous as the girls.
You'll like it, believe me.
My father objected to our marriage.
I suggest you cooperate.
This doesn't happen very often.
Make an appointment.
How many children do you have?
You can't smoke here.
I heard them coming.
I go to school because I want to learn.
I liked this striped shirt.
Tom has no insurance.
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young.
You're my best customer.
He has already begun.
I didn't understand what was happening.
Stop whining.
Politics leaves him cold.
That'll take a couple of hours.
What is it you really want to tell me?
Do you mean you're giving up?
I can't believe he kissed you.
He is fluent in French.
The church is in the middle of the village.
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
I don't know if she will go there with me.
Tom gave his dog a hug.
I can stay out of your way.
Write in the date yourself.
I hope that you won't make the same mistake as Tom.
We're early.
I still care.
Look at those clouds.
Please take me to the Grand Hotel.
I have to put my shoes on.
I opened a window.
They agreed to elect him as president.
Are you suggesting it's a design flaw?
They closed the shop at five.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
No one cares about us.
White smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel.
How did that happen?
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
What do you feel like doing tonight?
Eating between meals is a bad habit.
Please send me a letter as soon as you arrive.
Have you put on sunscreen?
My dress is ruined.
I know you'd prefer a bottle of red wine.
Don't tease me.
The moment I held the baby in my arms, it began to cry.
Why do I tell you people anything?
He is what we call a scholar.
She's drop-dead gorgeous.
Please pass me the sugar.
Everyone is doing it.
I think we're neighbors.
Online banking is very convenient.
Is that depressing?
When did you visit your friends?
I found the picture you were looking for.
That country has a trade surplus. It exports more than it imports.
Are you out of your mind?
I'd never let that happen.
It was not clear what she said.
We were both a bit drunk.
Why did I trust you?
These dogs are big.
We didn't kiss.
I found this book interesting from start to finish.
It's an ambitious project.
Let's have a ten-minute break.
I've been saving up to buy a new saxophone.
I'm starting to like you.
I want to retire.
It's only money.
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
I really like this skirt. Can I try it on?
I'm sure that's wrong.
I try not to use more paper than I need.
Where are your gloves?
I want to cook for you.
Tom's novel has been translated into French.
Manpower was no problem.
You're the one who trained me.
The crowd applauded.
Are you free this afternoon?
We are all in the same situation.
I knew you couldn't do it.
That student raised his hand to ask a question.
I really have to finish my homework.
I couldn't stop myself from laughing.
Have I convinced you?
We won't use that.
I was surprised to see a lion.
He was supposed to come.
Why do you look so gloomy?
My father made me what I am.
Tie your shoe.
Are you looking for someone?
I'm going back to the office.
We can't lose sight of that.
Will you dance with me?
What time is it by your watch?
He played a minor part in the play.
I asked her for a date.
They believe in God.
You can't do this alone.
I hope you're not offended.
They're up to no good.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.
I waited for a bus to come.
You should go home now.
You should have been more careful with your health.
Stop worrying.
I didn't take the time to do it properly.
Tom drinks coffee.
We're sloshed.
He introduced the problem of education into the conversation.
How much did it cost us?
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that.
Are we on speakerphone?
Some people questioned his honesty.
I'm not sure why.
He did it the way I told him to.
Do you know why?
Do I have to go to the party?
I can't keep it.
Do you want the details now?
Are you ready to begin?
Tom quietly opened the door and tiptoed into the room.
Please allow me to go.
Tom is the star of the show.
You must come with me.
Where is the nearest supermarket?
And now, it's my turn!
Tom was first one to leave.
I want to spend more time doing things that make me happy.
Many stores offer discounts in the month of August.
Drink this juice.
Let's do it now.
I don't want to be tied to one company.
What about you?
You're a slob.
The work is almost finished.
Mary claims you stole her pearls.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
That doesn't seem very heroic.
Tom ran towards the bushes.
It's ahead of schedule.
This is so good.
He left early.
It happened just the way you predicted.
Be nice.
They're not happy.
I wanted to help, but I couldn't do anything.
Everyone started clapping.
I think you might need me.
I heard somebody talking.
The game became exciting.
Tom always speaks French.
Our refrigerator is out of order.
I feel more confident now.
I feel really stupid.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I didn't buy it because it was really expensive.
You have a good reputation.
You'll lose everything.
It's dead.
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
Tom explained his plan to Mary.
I guess I'm just a little sleepy.
Do you think he did the job on his own?
The nurse hit a blood vessel.
We left Boston at 2:30 yesterday.
You don't have a clue.
I've been waiting for you for 5 hours.
Oh, don't be so modest.
I'll remember you forever.
I didn't ask you to do that.
There is no excuse for such behavior.
I can understand your language.
My mother made me study.
Do you have a lighter?
I admit that he is right.
Tom had never kissed anyone before.
We have time to spare.
The area of the factory is 1,000 square meters.
The terrible scene made him tremble in fear.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
You will obey us.
They were born in Thailand.
I give you everything you ask for, but you never seem satisfied.
I'm glad you could make it.
I saw a town in the distance.
I understand.
I already said no.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
I'd die without you.
Don't worry.
It's too late for me.
Tom is smarter than Mary.
I called Tom's house, but nobody answered.
You have no idea how distressed she was.
Change is important.
What makes you think that I like you?
I'm doing pretty well.
This is a hard question to answer.
I have a receipt.
Is Tom aware of what he did?
It's your problem, not mine.
How did you get interested in art?
How's your wife doing?
I fear that I might not be able to help you.
I'm a beginner, too.
You're the one who trained me.
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
Tom has departed for Australia.
Who forced you to do that?
He often goes to Tokyo.
I'm not telling you again.
They guaranteed regular employment to their workers.
How much money do you spend on textbooks per semester?
If that happens, call me.
Sometimes I wonder whether or not I made the right decision.
Can you close the door?
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
It's not the real thing.
Do you think that's significant?
I awoke to find a burglar in my room.
What a bore!
Did I really say that?
He lacks judgement.
I think it's very dangerous.
I already answered that question.
He lived to be eighty years old.
They told me about it.
This is a good book for children to read.
Let's not forget the real reason we're here.
It reads like a fairy tale.
This is going to be the hottest summer in thirty-six years.
Remember these rules.
I saw them enter the bank.
They are our guests.
Tom isn't a good bricklayer.
I wanted to see you, too.
Will you help me for a minute?
Tom had his wisdom teeth taken out by a twenty-four year old dentist.
Don't break my heart.
She was very rude to him.
I don't like your suggestion.
You're new here, aren't you?
Who're you looking for?
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
Could you please tell me what your cell phone number is?
I think we all know what's happening.
I don't know what to say to make you feel better.
Tell me where you've been.
This is pretty extreme.
They want more.
You get out only what you put in.
Are you afraid of dogs?

What are you going to do if it rains?
This feels right.
He slapped her.
Have you called him yet?

You won't be fired.
I have the same problem as you do.
I lost my way in the forest.
He hesitated for a moment.
The man looked at me.
Who's your teacher?
He presented an argument for the war.
I was very disconcerted to find that everyone else already knew it.
Let me write it down so I don't forget.
Tom wiped his face with a towel.

Feminine logic is not always logical.
I cheered myself up by listening to music.
It's important that he hears this.

They're similar.
Do you still have feelings for her?
She is afraid of falling ill again.
Are you ready to go?

We have to be at work by nine.
You're not very organized, are you?
Keep in mind what I tell you.
You can't possibly really believe that.

You're very busy.
Are you really going to do that?
You can ask Tom for help.

Do you really want to put your money in that bank?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tom told me that Mary was the one who told him that.
It is useless to go on strike now.
May I join you?
A strange feeling came over me.
He was alone in the house.
I laughed so hard I almost cried.
Stop being so curious.
Tell us how we may help you.
I know that I've helped you.
You're a thief.
Tom has a meeting tomorrow.
He died of natural causes.
I knew I was making mistakes.
The situation is critical.
Meet me at 2:30.
I looked for him in the supermarket.
We're sure we can do that.
It won't be difficult for us to do that.
Go ahead.
I've been very busy lately.
Get on with it.
Our dorm's heating system isn't working properly.
There has probably been a mistake.
I have often been here.

I drank a beer.
I should've said I was busy.

Tom told me he wanted to cry.
Do you want to come over tonight?
I need a weapon.
We must, first of all, be careful of our health.
He went to the United States to study English.
I didn't think you needed one.
Did I hurt you?
The police chased the stolen car.
I wish I had a friend like you.
May I have some rice?
We stayed home because it was raining.
I just wanted to make that clear.
Tom kissed his cousin.
Help me pick out a tie to go with this suit.
Maybe this was a mistake.
I don't know what to sing.
It was an uphill struggle.
I don't know what the consequences will be.
I messed up.
How many does he want?
I'm through with my work. Let's go out.
Bring a lunch.
You seem perfect for the job.
Don't tell me what I saw.
Is that not enough?
It was a great blow to us.
The almond trees are in bloom.
We've been there before.
My father used to read to me at bedtime.
My aunt lived a happy life.
He failed to come on time.
You don't look very strong.
Did I give you enough time?
She didn't reply.
You're not tired, are you?
I was elected.
A person views things differently according to whether they are rich or poor.
We need not have hurried.
That's kind of rare.

Are you ready to begin?

His bag was stolen yesterday.
It was to be expected.
I'm looking for a sweater.
I have a red car.
What is better than friendship?
I'd rather not eat the same food again today.
You've read the report, haven't you?
Do you like mine?
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
You can't hurt me anymore.
How come you didn't call me last night?
This is your final warning.
I was tempted to call in sick.
Don't talk to me!
What will we eat?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
A university job would give you a lot more free time.
He's in big trouble.
I'd love to have more children.
They are Russian.
I saw her home.
Why are you so secretive?
Why were you fired?
You were my friend.
You'd better go in person.
They say that he is the richest person in the world.
I think you'd better give up.
Are they taking good care of you?
They went surfing.
The rumor was completely without foundation.
He's really selfish.
Tell Tom I'm on my way.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
Tom is a really cool guy.
I'd like you to come back next week.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Just don't get involved, OK?
Are you doing anything special for New Year's Eve?
We drive everywhere.
If you want me to play the piano, I'll play the piano.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

Bring along your friend.
I go to the library from time to time.
He owns this land.
A Persian cat was sleeping under the table.
I don't know if I should tell him.
I regret not having kept my promise.

I wonder if he can reserve the flight for me.
Did you have a nice evening?
No one believed me.
She kept working.
He is either drunk or mad.
All you have to do is try your best.
That totally slipped my mind.
The game is not over.
Are those your daughters?
By the way, did you have any spare time to go sightseeing while you were there?
Tom knows this city very well.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Nobody in the world wants war.

I wasn't really certain of that.
The police are after you.
Don't be so lazy.
Is that allowed?
Please wait around for a while.
Keep driving.
Is tomorrow a holiday?
He seemed to like that.
I spent a lot of money yesterday.
He's mumbling something.
Father is watering flowers.
I'm not sure why Tom asked me that.
I couldn't understand a single word of what they said.
Has the bell rung?
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
It'd be easy to do that.
I am surprised to learn this.
What if they're wrong?
That would seem likely.
Tom looks a little nervous.
I often take a nap right after lunch.
Tom was Mary's best friend in high school.
He was re-elected mayor.
You're no doctor.
He's a little taller than you are.
She stabbed him in the back.
I am very hungry.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
Something embarrassing happened last week.
Pork doesn't agree with me.
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain.
We're truly worried.
You may meet him.
Without your help, he would fail.
We're ruined.
You do want that, don't you?
I'll go meet her soon.
I have to lose weight, so I'm on a diet.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't like it.
My son can already count to one hundred.
I'll take it.
He delivers newspapers.
Refugees in Africa are seeking help.
I knew he would accept.
Tom is driving me nuts.
Can you loan me a pen?
He's ruthless.
You are the one.
I think you need help.
I have two cousins.
They can't do that.
This one's still alive.
None of that actually happened.
Tom will know what we should do.
Why would anybody come here?
I'm going to work now.
I'm giving you what you want.
He has no friends besides me.
Just when I was about to phone her, a letter arrived from her.
They followed you here.
This building is the architect's crowning achievement.
I won't let you drive.
They're back where they want to be.
I don't like this place.
When did you find out?
This house is haunted.
I canceled it.
I thought you had all the answers.
Hand me the hammer, will you?
He is neither for nor against the plan.
He was still alive when the rescue party arrived.
I'll stay here.
I don't remember any of their names.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
He just left.
My husband makes a hundred thousand dollars a year.
Can you teach me how to swim?
He was silent for what seemed to me an hour.
That's a promise.
He is fond of painting.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
I really don't have enough money.
I didn't think anything was suspicious.
You're not married, are you?
Tom tiptoed into the bedroom to avoid waking up his wife.
He is lying through his teeth.
I'm not sure of the exact date.
What time does the next train leave for Tokyo?
You're such a jerk.
We were proud of our strength.
You don't know the truth.
We're twins.
I think you should reconsider this.
Did you think about our offer?
I never thought Tom would follow me here.
I woke up with a headache.
What do you think about this outfit?
It rained for hours and hours.
You are very rich.
He came back two days later.
We miss you a lot.
I didn't try to go any further.
Tom said he wanted to do more.
You're very sophisticated.
Oh, didn't I mention it?
He has a good record as a businessman.
That's hardly likely.
His argument was logical.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
I think about them often.
I need an interpreter.
They got into the train.
You just screwed up.
Did you fall in love with her at first sight?
We've been asked not to do that.
I met him the day before.
Tom wanted to be famous.
Why are you standing there?
What time is it over there?
Where do you work?
He's coming closer.
How many were on the plane?
Hold the racket tight.
I believe in ghosts.
I feel kind of nauseous.
Give me your money.
I've decided to quit my job at the end of this month.
We'll all be home in time for dinner.
He has acted wisely.
He studied very hard.
How old were you when you did that?
I'm afraid you can't do that.
Please don't forget to put stamps on the letters that I gave you to mail.
I think you look hot.
Can you justify the use of violence?
Tom ate dinner in the dark.
I had to get something out of the car.
Did Tom tell you the good news?
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
They worked through the night.
What do you think of the new teacher?
Be discreet.
Ask him where he parked his car.
I decided to go there.
This is strictly between us.
I can't just stay here.
Nobody understood why the elephant suddenly turned on its owner.
Her dream will one day come true.
I will give you this bicycle as a birthday present.
Can you sing the song?
Who told you to talk to me?
Well done, Tom.
Tom answered the teacher's questions.
I baked it for you.
The aim of this game is to explode all the bombs on the screen.
Did the trip live up to your expectations?
We associate the name of Darwin with the theory of evolution.
I finally feel like everything's going my way.
Tom doesn't get up as early as Mary.
Tom wanted Mary to say yes.
I was wearing my best clothes.
I just kept my mouth shut.
I guess not.
Cows supply milk.
I just want them both to be happy.
Tom ate quickly.
If it were not for the sun, no living creatures could exist on the earth.
Do you mind if I open the window?
They started dancing.
I live there by myself.
He reached out for the sugar that was on the other table.
It was a mess.
I'm doing that this morning.
I'm going to brush my teeth.
I have a few friends in the United States.
Our conversation was interrupted by his sneezes.
You're very busy.
Tell Tom what Mary told you.
No one is irreplaceable.
Thanks a lot.
Staying home isn't fun.
I went out for a beer with my friends.
Could you turn off the lights?
Tom took Mary's money.
I think it was a mistake that you didn't take my advice.
You need to decide what kind of person you want to be.
If you see or hear anything, let me know.
He promised he would help us.
The town was full of activity.
Be prepared.
I'll leave it up to you.
They had a choice.
When was this temple built?
I should've warned you.
I do not mind what you do.
I hope you can forgive me.
He often eats fish for dinner.
Industrialization often goes hand in hand with pollution.
I think you're going to enjoy spending time with Tom.
I have one child.
Bring me a glass of water.
Thanks for adding me as a friend.
You should learn from your mistakes.
Tom promised us his support.
I need to be at work by 7:30.
I dream about you quite often.
Please stop laughing.
Would you look after my children while I am away on vacation?
Both of my sisters are married.
Who made this pie?
We haven't had to deal with this before.
You're not helping much.
Don't open your book.
Who caused the accident?
I can't help crying.
This house and this land are mine.
He's done it before.
How did you get into my house?
She has a cottage by the sea.
The history class starts at nine.
We could use your help.
The world champions were the Swedes.
She is not here yet.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you and your boyfriend had broken up?
I'm used to cooking for myself.
Did I tell you that?
They crossed the border.
Have you ever been kissed before?
What would you like to talk about?
Her car broke down on the way.
I'm not planning anything.
I want Mary.
I'm not supposed to help you.
You're on the list.
What are you talking about?
She went shopping.
He did what I told him to do.
Everybody can see that he has a crush on her.
How's that going for you?
Tom wants to live in the country after he retires.
Do you have a subway map?
What are they waiting for?
It's all perfect.
Tom can't control himself.
We're going to try.
My legs are hurting.
I'll go if you insist.
I'm looking for a place to live.
Try to get a good night's sleep.
Flour is made from wheat.
He writes a daily journal, and that inspired me to try doing the same thing, but in English.
I'm not sure I want to see it.
He does not take care of his children.
Do you have plans for tomorrow night?
Tom may do whatever he wants.
When can I see you next time?
Did they live here?
Contact me for more information.
Anyone can make mistakes.
Take whichever one you like.
You're no friend of mine.
He did his best to be in time for the train.
A lot of people would like to become famous. However, a lot of famous people wish they weren't so famous.
You can't change your mind now.
He stood aside for her to enter.
I made a deal.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
It's unlikely that I'll have time to finish this project before next week.
It's important for us to think about the future of the world.
No one's gambling.
That's amazing!
A GPS device can pinpoint your location anywhere in the world.
Few students can read Latin.
Nobody can hear you.
You can go there.
Take whichever you like.
I lost my wedding ring.
They came last week.
I had to change the plan.
The key was nowhere to be found.
It's gotten better.
This sounds interesting.
She also speaks French.
How long did you stay?
I want to stay alive.
Many lives were lost.
You have to stay fit.
I'm sure Tom did his best.
It's not how much you know, but what you can do that counts.
I want you back today.
I didn't know what was happening.
Close your eyes.
What's your favorite racing game?
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
You're very brave.
I'm sick of lying.
Your problem is similar to mine.
I feel like I'm a teenager again.
He refused to shake hands.
It's too late now.
Tom's deaf.
I've got eyes.
They don't teach you that in school.
Don't you know his name?
I'm sorry, I left my homework at home.
You're very angry.
Don't touch my car.
I sleep on my side.
We don't know the answer yet.
He's smarter than me.
My dad works all day.
Where did you learn French?
I always wanted to be a teacher.
I am engaged in AIDS research.
I shouldn't have invited Tom to my party.
I read a lot of magazines.
Boys can be trained to behave.
Is that genuine?
We miss you very much.
Where are the toilets?
I don't see any options.
Your dinner is getting cold.
Tom said he doesn't know anyone in Boston.
The CIA is watching you.
Did you iron all the shirts?
I will give you whatever you want.
I had a good time during the trip.
Fear of failure prevents many people from reaching their full potential.
Who's going?
What's going to happen to your prisoners?
I'm not having a good day.
What is your registration number?
Are you seriously thinking about buying that old car?
I really don't know what to say.
I talked to friends.
Why do you let Tom to do this to you?
Give me your phone.
Your mother is worried sick about you.
I told you about this last week.
She lit the candles.
Is there a reason that you're asking?
I know Tom can't understand French.
They had a spat yesterday.
You're very sophisticated.
I didn't think you needed one.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him to.
Tom was obviously worried about what might happen.
You are mistaken about that.
I'm furious.
The offer is too good to be turned down.
I'm glad you're here with me.
Why do I have to go to school?
I'll leave.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
We've run out of food.
Our TV is out of order.
I want to be a pilot when I grow up.
I have so much to say.
Next time you come, don't forget to give it back to me.
How was your summer?
You have to be prepared.
Are you sure about that?
I've had a very busy morning.
That could come in handy.
What did Tom offer you?
I didn't do anything all day.
You could be one of them.
I believe they're a perfect match.
The mail has arrived.
Don't you see what you've become?
My sister is too young to go to school.
We postponed the event.
I'm just trying to be friendly.
Call the doctor right away.
I will deal with them myself.
Do you understand French?
How did you spend your free time?
Do you want another piece of pie?
Aren't you hot?
How to overcome the high value of the yen is a big problem.
I stayed at Tom's house in Boston.
Come on, hurry up. You'll miss the bus.
I don't think I really matter to you.
She hit me, not him.
You can't really blame Tom for that.
How are things at work?
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
How cute!
He'll wait for you.
That is just typical of him.
Maybe I should slow down.
Are you blushing?
It's not hopeless.
Do you understand her?
That's beautiful.
Tom surprised a burglar in his house.
The weather is very cold in Istanbul.
We have to obey orders.
Over 100 people were present at the party.
She repeated her name slowly.
Tom's injuries aren't considered life-threatening.
It was such a hard test that we did not have time to finish.
Tom asked for a raise.
Can I borrow your pen?
Are you happy doing that?
I don't think you have much choice.
Tom is an ambulance driver.
Tom would never agree to that.
I'm sorry that I didn't reply sooner.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Do you want to become a father?
I'll try to contact Tom.
What did you do on the weekend?
Give me a kiss.
Tell me how to play the game.
Tom was really tired.
Give me a coffee, please.
The house has burnt down.
I'm sorry Tom isn't here.
When did you hear the sound?
Professional translators quite often specialize in just one field, for example law or medicine.
I don't like being surprised.
Did I ask for your help?
There's no food.
Tom has no luck.
Tom wanted to cry.
Most of us were veterans.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Are you coming?
I'm not in the least afraid of it.
You need to buy some fruit and vegetables.
The best thing would be for you to do the work yourself.
Do you have your plane ticket?
I can't stand this pain any more.
Grief drove her mad.
The tines of the fork are bent.
Tom has an ear for music.
Sweep my room.
You'd better go home.
They were caught in a blizzard.
I cleaned the fish.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
Where do you watch television?
Don't get me started.
I heard that.
Is there something in the fridge we can drink?
Somebody tried to kill me.
What can you say?
What floor do you live on?
I am familiar with your name.
I'm not supposed to drink.
Give me your telephone number.
Why are you acting like this?
Let Tom make the decisions.
Are you on any medication right now?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
That car is hers.
My little brother always sleeps with his teddy bear.
How can you concentrate?
You're very timid.
Why didn't you call me sooner?
She got off at the next station.
My son thinks women are stronger than men.
Tom poisoned Mary's dog.
I waved.
Don't make me say it again.
That house is for rent.
Tom died.
Where can I park?
We're sure we can do that.
He did it for the money.
Wash up.
A strong wind severed the electric wires in several places.
His house is by the river.
We didn't need that.
All I want you to do is talk to us.
Not all girls are like that.
Do you want something to eat?
He built a fence around his house.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
Do you have a pencil?
Could I have a tissue?
I saw you in the park yesterday.
Check, please.
One of your neighbors complained.
I am about to leave here.
It was astonishing.
When did you come back from London?
I've gone to Kyoto twice.
How do you know which one is yours?
Where are the garden shears?
He is giving me a hard time.
I don't actually work here.
Tom and Mary agreed to work together on the project.
That's not true.
I feel like taking a bath now.
I asked the butcher to trim all the fat off of the meat.
I'm really proud of it.
Trim the fat off the meat.
I'm very tired today.
I have no idea what this means.
I should've just shut up.
There's very little paper left.
The TV is broken.
I paid a lot of money for these.
I want you to give me a job.
Do you have a dictionary?
It doesn't matter whether you come or not.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
He has a reputation as being straight as an arrow. He'd never get involved in corruption.
She's seventeen years old.
Please follow me.
This is the fastest car in our showroom.
Our new teacher is fresh out of college.
His family didn't have much money.
Tom says that the book is interesting.
I don't know them at all.
He left the door unlocked.
Is Tom supposed to be doing that?
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
Never choose a vocation just because it permits the wearing of good clothes.
They were so happy together.
Wow! What a big box!
How can you concentrate?
I didn't mean to interrupt you.
You should do that.
What are you both doing in here?
Put a lid on it!
What has become of him?
The cat which you found is mine.
Where is the most beautiful place in the world?
It will cost around 10,000 yen.
I'm not surprised.
I'm impressed.
She needed some money to buy something to feed her dog.
They say there are ghosts in this old house.
I'm working on a new idea.
The company announced hundreds of layoffs.
We're doing everything we can to find your son.
They're very fond of him.
I don't wish to interfere.
We have an obligation to try.
I didn't mean to hit him.
He is tired of reading.
I am sad to hear it.
I thought I told you to clean your room.
Did anyone see it happen?
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
I bought this racket two months ago.
Just don't break anything.
Do you know what I mean?
We're not happy.
She's always on the go.
It's raining everywhere.
Did you see the news?
I agree to your proposal.
I have a bruise.
The American Civil War is the central theme of the book.
I'm going to be gone soon.
The war lasted two years.
I just want to go to heaven.
You can say whatever you want to.
It was an awful week.
I need my privacy.
Tell me what really happened.
Sometimes water becomes a precious commodity.
They want you dead.
No one ate anything.
I can't let you go.
His skill qualifies him for the job.
Is there something you haven't told me?
I can do it all myself.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
I checked the door to make sure it was locked.
He was frozen to death.
Marry me.
Don't worry about a thing.
I work from Monday through Saturday.
I took a week off.
A dog will bark at strangers.
He was drunk on beer.
No one asked your opinion.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
Don't make me ask you again.
How did you get hurt?
The sky is full of stars.
She and I get on well.
Don't answer that.
I'd like to drink something hot.
My wife's trying to sleep.
This is all I've got left.
What has made you decide to work for our company?
Can I come in?
I went twice.
Take off your shoes.
It wasn't expensive.
Did you think of that?
Hey, I want to help you.
I will deal with them myself.
I never expected to find such a nice hotel in a place like this.
I read a lot of books in French.
He couldn't help himself.
You're lucky you didn't die.
He proved to be a spy.
How did you lose so much weight?
Anybody will do.
Tom taught Mary how to ride a bicycle.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
The meeting isn't over.
It's great that you were able to come.
She has just turned twenty.
I know who that is now.
She laid her head down on the pillow.
How dare you insult my sister!
Tell me what to do with it.
The job offer still stands.
Tom wants to show you something.
Tom took a bite of my apple.
You're the only one who can do this.
They carried the injured player away on a stretcher.
Everything went horribly wrong.
I let my guard down momentarily.
Do you want to know who did this?
She will be back at five.
A green carpet will not go with this blue curtain.
I never knew that.
You're very sophisticated.
I want you to be here when I get back.
I almost got a perfect score.
May I interrupt you?
They seem to be enjoying themselves.
She stopped talking.
Let's leave as soon as Tom gets here.
You shouldn't be in here.
I know you're in love with me.
You handled that well.
I've never seen anyone like you.
Is it that hard?
Tom walked his dog.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
Too much of anything is bad, but too much good whiskey is barely enough.
It's time to leave.
They agreed to meet me here.
I am not going anywhere.
Tom is hiding in the attic.
Don't try to keep her to yourself.
She asked me whether I know how to sew.
Put some clothes on.
What a wonderful morning! I feel on top of the world.
It's hard to tell.
Quiet, please.
Is it an action movie?
We were truly surprised.
Do you think he will like my gift?
Is that too much to ask?
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I went camping with my family.
We went on foot.
That store is closed on Mondays.
A number of tickets are sold in advance.
I have nothing to do with it.
She talked him into buying her a diamond ring.
Don't try to talk right now.
You've already given me enough money.
Why are you waiting?
Do you even care?
She is on a diet to lose weight.
Which team is ours?
I blame you for this, Tom.
Both of them started laughing.
I owe what I am today to you.
They're playing our song.
The fridge is empty.
The Japanese eat rice at least once a day.
You're not allowed to eat those.
We really have a lot to do.
I think you might like it.
The pizza's on the way.
She broke into tears.
You never can tell what you might find at that store.
I think you need some sleep.
She calls him every night and talks for at least an hour.
It was broken.
Cats can see in the dark.
I like your dress.
I think there's going to be trouble.
I know how proud you are of your work.
You're lying now.
When she heard the news, she broke down crying.
I thought we were friends.
My schedule is really tight right now.
The situation is a lot worse than we imagined.
I've heard of him, but I don't know him personally.
I don't see much of him.
I'm hardworking.
Tom is too old for me.
Tom doesn't even know my name.
Have you ever traveled in a plane?
This sword is in fair condition.
Tom loved teaching French.
I've got something to do.
Has anyone ever broken your heart?
You're not here, so I'm really sad.
You always sing.
There is no knowing when a severe earthquake will happen in Tokyo.
There is an urgent need for peace talks.
I owe what I am today to my uncle.
Could you do that?
It saddens me to hear you say that.
I like the ocean.
She married a sailor.
I think this is very rare.
This is the perfect location.
Tom asked me to come back tomorrow.
It's going to be harder this time.
It depends on you.
Let's hope for good results.
They had a debate on same-sex marriage.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Everyone was alert.
This wine is very expensive.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
I don't like to talk about Tom.
Tom liked to play chess.
I can't believe you're getting married.
Nothing happened after all.
This is important to me.
Even if it should rain, I will start tomorrow.
Are you going to a movie?
Do you have any other questions about the matter?
Somebody answered.
I've got a few friends.
These are my students.
Tom asked Mary to come over and help.
I really did learn a lot.
There's no need for you to study.
The decision is not easy.
I've been waiting for the bus for half an hour.
